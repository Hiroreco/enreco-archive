## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install
   ```
Note: You might need you install all the shadcn radix dependency manually if it asks you too, I don't know how to get around this yet
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
Note: You only need to care about the "View" stuff in "./view", the editor stuff is only for developent (it's also gross to look at))
