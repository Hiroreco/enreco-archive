      "dayRecap": "## Day 1: Welcome to Libestal\n\nAnd so the journey begins. Summoned to the fantastical *Kingdom of Libestal* by its King, 19 heroes, each with their unique quirks, are tasked with a vital mission: to combat the looming threat known as The Stains. Yet, this new reality is not without its complications. Each of them, stripped of their memories, awoke with no recollection of their past lives, leaving them to navigate this strange world as strangers even to themselves.\n<br>\n\n\nChaos and confusion ruled the day, which was to be expected. The girls were divided into four distinct guilds, each representing a unique philosophy:\n\n- **Jade Sword:** The beacon of the righteous and loyal, where great threats are faced with even greater courage  \n- **Cerulean Cup:** The sanctum of healing, where the spirit of empathy and devotion thrives.\n- **Amber Coin**: The home for glory-seekers with ambition and vision, where closest allies become fiercest rivals.\n- **Scarlet Wand:** The haven for the curious, where knowledge and creativity are valued above all.\n<br>\n\n[The four guild masters](#image:images-opt/guildmasters.webp)\n<br>\n\nTasked and trusted by the king, the heroes set out to acclimate to their new world. They learned about its intricate systems, including forming parties, using telepathic devices for communication, undertaking quests to earn coins, and more. Central to their roles were the unique weapons bestowed upon them. Each weapon possessed a special ability, or *Revelation* tied exclusively to its wielder—a power as mysterious as it was significant. \n<br>\n\n\nThe day's primary mission led them to the *Underworld Dungeon*, a foreboding place tied to the essence of death. Success in conquering the dungeon promised a reward of profound value: the restoration of fragments of their lost memories.\n<br>\n\n[The girls attempting the Underworld Dungeon](#image:images-opt/underworld-dungeon.webp)\n<br>\n\nHowever, this was far from the day's only story. The heroes summoned by the king proved to be anything but ordinary. Beyond the main quest, countless shenanigans unfolded, along with budding relationships and unexpected narratives. For every grand objective, there were personal moments of humor, mischief, and discovery.",

            "content": "A soft, timid *“Bau bau”* escaped from *Fuwawa* as she woke up in the white box. Everything was unfamiliar, and like someone who seemed oddly familiar to her—Mococo Abyssguard—Fuwawa was completely lost and confused. \n<br>\n\nAs she moved around, sniffing those around her, she couldn’t shake the feeling that Nerissa was [trouble](https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?feature=shared&t=572), much like Mococo had sensed. When talking to Raora, Fuwawa introduced herself as a demon dog, though her gentle demeanor and iconic “Ehehehe” giggle made it hard to imagine anything demonic about her. She radiated warmth, more fluffy than fearsome.\n<br>\n\n[I'm a demon dog!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?feature=shared&t=871)\n<br>\n\nDuring the battle with the *Stain King*, Fuwawa revealed her weapon: a pair of [sharp blue claws](https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?feature=shared&t=3181). When she activated their *Revelation*, a whirlwind of slashes tore through the enemy. After the battle, she was sorted into the *Jade Sword* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?feature=shared&t=3471), ready to begin her journey.\n<br>\n\n\nFuwawa’s adventure in the kingdom was off to a calm start. She explored the new world, took on quests, and, like always, found herself adorably [confused](https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?feature=shared&t=4981) most of the time. But that was part of her charm, and everyone around her found it endearing. Oddly, Mococo’s voice would occasionally echo around Fuwawa, even when Mococo wasn’t nearby, as if the two were in the same room. \n<br>\n\n[Quiet down over there](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?feature=shared&t=4778)\n<br>\n\nTo avoid further confusion when filling out tasks, Fuwawa tried her best to stay focus when reading the requirements. She was so focused that she completely ignored the Hot Pink One's attempt to greet her.\n<br>\n\n[Too locked in](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?t=5438)\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Fuwawa joined forces with Nerissa, Bijou, Mococo, and Raora to tackle the *Underworld Dungeon*. The conquest, though chaotic, ended successfully with the group recovering memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/uIHK81QMI24?feature=shared&t=3462). Afterward, Fuwawa spent time with the group before calling it a day.\n",

Thankfully, the tension eased as she got to know the others. They were weird but friendly. She also ocasionally let out \"Bau Bau\" as a way to express her emotions.   \n<br>\n\n\nDuring the battle with the *Stain King*, Mococo didn’t have the best start—being the [first to fall](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=3153). She didn’t stay down long, though, and that’s when her true weapon made its debut: a pair of [sharp pink claws](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=3184). When their *Revelation* activated, Mococo unleashed a wild flurry of slashes, her movements filled with raw fury. After the battle, she found herself sorted into the *Jade Sword* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=3462).\n<br>\n\n\nHer first encounter in the guild was with *Fuwawa Abyssguard*, who looked so similar it was almost uncanny. \n<br>\n\n[You also bau bau?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=3549)\n<br>\n\nJust when Mococo thought she’d gotten over her initial fear of this new world, a different fear crept in: loneliness. When checking out the Jade Sword arena, she wandered off alone and, realizing she was left behind, began to panic. Luckily, her guildmates found her in time and promised they’d always stick by her (see [Elizabeth-Mococo: By your side](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-left-3-right-2)). \n<br>\n\n\nWith her fears calmed, Mococo dove into learning about this strange world. She lit up with joy when she figured out how to ride a [horse](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=4345) and couldn’t stop laughing as she repeatedly destroyed a berry bush for fun. Though she was often confused, it didn’t stop her from having a blast.\n<br>\n\n[Funniest thing she'd ever seen](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=6611)\n<br>\n\nLater, Mococo teamed up with *Bijou, Nerissa, Fuwawa, and Raora* to tackle the *Underworld Dungeon*. Let’s just say it was chaos—filled with shrieks and yelps, mostly from [Mococo and Fuwawa](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared&t=2143). Despite her best efforts to be brave, she looked more like a frightened pup than a fierce guard dog.\n<br>\n\n\nThrough many screams, screeches, and the many times falling into their doom, the five of them did manage to conquer the dungeon, and recovered memories of *[Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared&t=3463)*. She hung out with the four girls for a bit afterwards, getting very frusrated when she got [lost](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared&t=3688), got escorted by *Mysterious Hero I* to the [shore](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared&t=4152), and finally dedcided to call it a day. \n<br>\n\n\nIt was a day full of confusion and excitement for Mococo. Her pure, innocent nature made her stand out, and everyone appreciated her for it. Hopefully, she’d stay that way—untouched by greed or temptation, especially when things like, say, a lottery came into play.",

            "content": "Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame, once the mighty queen of the Bloodflame Kingdom, awoke in the fantastical kingdom of Libestal with no memory of her past life. Confusion was inevitable, but within her burned an unyielding fire—a deep sense of justice and a natural instinct to protect the weak. \n<br>\n\nIt was no surprise, then, that she was placed in the [Jade Sword](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?si=wjA60_hrPgwaKHhO&t=3519), the guild known as the beacon of righteousness and loyalty.\n<br>\n\n\nElizabeth wielded a massive claymore named Thorn, its fiery scarlet hue reflecting her unbreakable spirit. The sheer size of the blade made Shakira feel a tad self-conscious about her own [weapon](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?si=C9BFKwM0cwgfjdSw&t=3987), but Elizabeth, ever the knight, reassured her that size didn’t matter—it’s how you wield it. She was, after all, a symbol of knighthood: diligent, kind, and beloved by all. \n<br>\n\nOr so it should have been.   \n<br>\n\n[Quite the knight](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?feature=shared&t=8613)\n<br>\n\n\nReality painted a different picture. Instead of a tale of a noble knight, Elizabeth's first day became a comedy of errors. She was run over by horses, got [lost](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?si=uOp34AwQFe8CymWf&t=8087) repeatedly (even while searching for her own guild), left by her lonesome after everyone promised her a duel, and was teased endlessly for being mistaken as a member of [Amber Coin](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?si=yttis-Jdo0fiakRM&t=7205). \n<br>\n\nThe cherry on top? She was branded a harlot simply for hushing the gums of the Hot Pink One, albeit it was with no consent (see [Elizabeth-Tam: Red and Blue](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-tam-gandr-top-3-top-2)). During all this, her internal music seemed to change with the situation, as if her life were a melodramatic play.\n<br>\n\n[Immersion](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?t=8848)\n<br>\n\n\nDespite the chaos, Elizabeth found solace in her guildmates, with whom she felt an undeniable connection. Perhaps her nature was to be kind, to stand for the weak, no matter the mishaps. She felt this strongly with the two doggos (see [Elizabeth-Mococo: By Your Side](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-left-3-right-2)). \n<br>\n\nContinuing on, by the end of the day, alongside Gonathon G and Nino Ina, two of which are of Cerulean Cup, Elizabeth conquered the *Underworld Dungeon*, reclaiming the lost memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?feature=shared&t=12428). It marked not just the end of her chaotic first day but the beginning of her journey in this strange new world.\n",

The real issue? She had no memory of anything, not even her own name. Her first interaction was with a sharky girl, who, to her observation, had a questionable [smell](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=552). The people around her seemed equally bizarre. Confused and overwhelmed, the blonde tried to break out, but escape was impossible. \n<br>\n\nShe soon discovered that she had been summoned by a King to save the kingdom. Save it? Not her style. Instead, she had a different plan: take over the kingdom. Revelation? No thanks—she was more about [revolution](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=2486). Despite overhearing murmurs from others, including *Gonathon*, about her rebellious plans, the blonde was undeterred. Her determination to overthrow the King was clear, evident in how she brushed off any explanations from the guild masters and focused on her singular goal.   \n<br>\n\n[Skippa Skippa Skippa](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?t=2609)\n<br>\n\n\nDuring the battle with the Stain King, Ame—who introduced herself as [Jyon Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=2554)—revealed her weapon: a [magnifying glass](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=3055). Its Revelation is a bonk on the enemy’s head. Cute, but not exactly earth-shattering. After the battle, she was sorted into the *Jade Sword* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=3328)—a group dedicated to protecting the King. Oh, the irony.\n<br>\n\nJyon's journey to overthrow the kingdom officially began. True to her rebellious nature, she quickly made a name for herself by riding her horse into random [bystanders](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=3966). Still, even revolutionaries need to learn the ropes. Jyon begrudgingly completed quests and figured out how the world worked, all while having chaotic run-ins with [others](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=5214). One notable incident involved Gonathon making a scene after spotting her, but thanks you her guild mates, she was able to slither out of trouble.\n<br>\n\n[Crazy beggar on the street](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=5893)\n<br>\n\nThen came the moment Jyon had been waiting for: her attempt to assassinate the King. She sneaked her way into the kingdom's castle, stealthily approached the King, carefully lining up her strike. \n<br>\n\nWith a dramatic flourish, she activated her Revelation, bonking the King on the head with her magnifying glass. She followed up with a flurry of attacks using her stone sword and even dug a hole beneath him with a pickaxe. The King was sure gone now... \n<br>\n\n[Your time is now, old man](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=6333)\n<br>\n\nActually, none of her attacks worked. Defeated but undeterred, she vowed to return for vengance.\n<br>\n\nLater, Gonathon confronted her again. This time, Jyon managed to persuade him, spinning a tale that convinced him to let her go (see [Gonathon-Jyon: King Killer](#edge:gonathon-g-ame-top-2-bottom-2)). With that hurdle cleared, she capped off her day with a prank call to Gura, claiming to represent the “Libestonian Charity.” Unsurprisingly, Gura wasn’t fooled and rejected her scam. \n<br>\n\n[I'm from the charity](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=7353)\n<br>\n\nSatisfied with the chaos she’d caused, Jyon called it a day.",

Embracing her role, she adopted the name *Tanakisha Karia*, though it proved difficult for others to pronounce, leading to the nickname [\"Shakira\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/izEX6XKyApQ?feature=shared&t=2943).\n<br>\n\nHer Revelation took the form of a blazing sword, [*Burning Phoenix*](https://www.youtube.com/live/izEX6XKyApQ?feature=shared&t=3181), carving a path of flames through its enemies.\n<br>\n\nShakira was sorted into the *Amber Coin* guild, a lively group that nearly gained another member, The Hot Pink One, before the Cerulean Cup  reclaimed the maiden despite Kiara's bold [attempt](https://www.youtube.com/live/izEX6XKyApQ?feature=shared&t=5610) to recruit her. But no worries, as her guild had a pink member of its own (see [Shakira-Raora: Big Pink Cat](#edge:kiara-raora-panthera-bottom-2-top-2)).\n<br>\n\nDetermined to forge her own path, Kiara embarked on her first major quest with her guildmates: delving into the *Underworld dungeon*.

Huh, whuh, where am I? Who are all these folks? Crikey, what’s happenin’? Let me out!. That was the rat's entrance into the fantasy world, it was...understandable to say the least. \n<br>\n\nShe claimed a corner to herself, staying put like a feral animal, ranting like one crazed old man would about the end of the world. Anyone who dared approach was met with a wild-eyed glare and threatening [babbling](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=343). She was not having it. She made it clear to everyone that she was a rat—a very weak one, in fact—and had no interest in playing hero, or whatever it was that she was summoned for.\n<br>\n\n[She just wants to go home](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?t=466)\n<br>\n\nHer first real interaction was with Tam Gandr, who casually mentioned she was destined to become the next *Queen of Libestal* (or so she claimed). Bae, starstruck by the revelation, saw an opportunity. If Tam became queen, maybe she could convince the king to send Bae back to her old life. Introducing herself as *Peasant Da Bae*, she swore to protect Tam in hopes of earning that favor.\n<br>\n\n[In the face of royal](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=2919)\n<br>\n\nDuring the battle with the Stain King, Bae briefly entertained the idea that she might actually be destined for a heroic title. That hopeful thought vanished the moment a laser beam hit her square in the [face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8bcLA6BQsw&t=3059s). Her weapon of choice, a [dice](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=3171), mirrored her unpredictable nature. Its Revelation? Rolling a number between 1 and 6, with the resulting explosions matching the roll. \n<br>\n\nDespite her paranoia, she made it through the fight and was sorted into the [Amber Coin](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=3446) guild alongside three others.\n<br>\n\nOnce in the kingdom, Bae’s adventures continued. She immediately clashed with *Cleopatra Eisenhower Da Vinci III the Great*, known as Three, who was also part of Amber Coin. Three wasted no time calling Bae a [weirdo](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=3510). Three did make fun of Bae before when someone tried to claim her [precious corner](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=2482), but this solidified the fact that her guildmate was not someone she can get along with.\n<br>\n\nThe two developed a love-hate relationship that leaned heavily on the hate. (see [Bae-Three: Friends](#edge:peasant-da-bae-moom-bottom-2-top-2)) \n<br>\n\nDespite her grumbling and reluctance, Bae completed her quests diligently. She hated the King for dragging her away from her comfortable life but went along with the tasks nonetheless. Toward the end of the day, she and her guildmates tackled the *Underworld Dungeon* and recovered memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=9842). \n<br>\n\nFor a moment, Bae considered the possibility that life here might not be so bad. Maybe she could make friends, build relationships, and fulfill her role as a hero...yeah, no. One dungeon was more than enough. After that, she disappeared, retreating to what she hoped would be an eternal nap, leaving her guildmates to handle the rest of the journey without her. A true hero’s exit.\n<br>\n\n[Adios, suckers](#embed:www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?t=10388)\n",

Like everyone else summoned into this world, she had no recollection of her past. When *Bijou* introduced herself, Raora followed suit, though Bijou struggled to pronounce her name, instead calling her [Waowa](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=2777).\n<br>\n\n\nDuring the confrontation with the Stain King, Raora’s prowess came to light. Her weapon of choice was that of a pair of sleek [white claws](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=3272). Upon activating their Revelation, she moved with the swiftness and agility of a panther, teleporting around her enemy and delivering a flurry of slashes. After the battle, Raora was assigned to the *Amber Coin* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=3543).\n<br>\n\n\nWithin the guild, Raora was treated much like a cherished pet. Her guildmates found her endearing, caring for her attentively and often searching for her when she [wandered off](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=3929). *Shakira*, in particular, took it upon herself to ensure Raora’s comfort and well-being (see [Shakira-Raora: Big Pink Cat](#edge:kiara-raora-panthera-bottom-2-top-2)). Raora was not one to talk, but rather, she remained quiet and [passive](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=5774) during most interactions, preferring to listen and occasionally offer a chuckle (wheeze) or a nod. \n<br>\n\n[She's just laughing](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?t=5854)\n<br>\n\nThroughout the day, she participated in various quests, often relying on her guildmates' assistance. Together, they successfully conquered the *Underworld Dungeon* and recovered the memories of *[Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=9964)*. While many would have taken a moment to rest, Raora chose to continue exploring the world.\n<br>\n\n\nHer adventures led to several memorable encounters. She met new faces, laughed at their antics, and at one point, suggested trading *Gura’s* life for her [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=10513). Raora's fondness for building soon became apparent as she gathered materials and began [constructing](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=12337) a base for her guild alongside Shakira. In doing so, she was among the first heroes to focus on such tasks, finding great satisfaction in the process.\n<br>\n\n\nOne of the more entertaining moments of her adventure then involved *Tam Gandr*. Tam made repeated efforts to teach Raora the correct pronunciation of her name, but Raora consistently mispronounced it, much to Tam’s frustration. Their conversation took an interesting turn when Tam declared her destiny to become the *Queen of Libestal*. Raora, however, countered with a confident assertion that she was destined for that role (see [Raora-Tam: Say my name](#edge:raora-panthera-tam-gandr-right-2-top-1)). \n<br>\n\n\nHer interactions with others were just as unpredictable. She accidentally hurt *Nerissa’s* feelings by bluntly saying they weren’t [friends](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=13860), she also tried to charm *Gonathon* with some suggestive gestures, only to casually mention that she planned to overthrow the king.\n<br>\n\n[Breaking it down](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=14436)\n<br>\n\nLater on, deciding that earning the trust of her “future subjects” was important, Raora volunteered to help Nerissa, Bijou, and the dog-like twins in the Underworld Dungeon, as she was to be the next queen after all. Although it's debatable whether her bursting into laughter when Fuwawa and Bijou fell into a pool of lava would be considered queenly behavior.\n<br>\n\n[She's laughing again](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?t=15966)\n<br>\n\nAfter helping them complete the dungeon, Raora finally called it a day. It had been a fun and eventful one, and perhaps the first steps toward her self-proclaimed destiny as the next queen of Libestal.\n",

The maiden in brown's reaction upon waking up in the white box was the same as everyone else: confused, dazed, and completely lost. \n<br>\n\nIt was very loud there, the noise from all the talking was overwhelming, but our subject, ever the quiet observer, simply wandered around, tossing out random [one-liners](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=2327) at people. For some reason, though, she saved most of her jabs for *Peasant Da Bae*. No one knew why—probably not even herself. \n<br>\n\nAnd as she wanderered around, the saw how everyone was trying to break one particular block.

And then...\n<br>\n\n[Breaking Dimensions](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?t=2426)\n<br>\n\nNext thing we know, our hero had somehow skipped ahead and was already fighting the Stain King. [Alone](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=2768). At the very least, there weren't any voices yammering around her anymore. During the battle, she revealed her weapon of choice: a [dagger](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=2940). When she activated its Revelation, it unleashed a flurry of rapid slashes towards the targeted enemy. Afterward, she had a chat with the guild masters and the King, finding herself amused by the Amber Coin guild master's [accent](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=2987). Coincidentally, she was sorted into the *Amber Coin* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=3306).  \n<br>\n\n\nWhen she first met up with her guildmates, after calling Bae a weirdo, Mumei introduced herself as *Cleopatra Eisenhower Da Vinci The Great III*. Bae shortened it to *Three*, for obvious reasons. Later, at the quest board, Three’s eyes lit up when she saw someone riding a [horse](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=3947). From that moment on, she was all about the horses. She enjoyed herself [way](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?t=4951s) too much, riding around like a knight from some chaotic medieval fair. Unfortunately for everyone else, her idea of fun included using her steed as a [battering ram](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=5259).\n<br>\n\n\nAlthough they started off rocky, Mumei and Bae ended up sticking together for most of the day. Sure, they bickered and called each other names, but somewhere along the way, a weird little friendship formed (see [Bae-Three: Friends(?)](#edge:peasant-da-bae-moom-bottom-2-top-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nBy the end of the day, Three and her guildmates conquered the *Underworld Dungeon* and recovered *[Mori Calliope’s](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=9831)* memories. Her start was odd indeed, but Three throughout the day had fun nontheless. Here’s hoping things stay fun—and that her love for trampling people with horses doesn’t get her in too much trouble.\n<br>\n\n[Trampling people with horses](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?t=10378)\n<br>\n\n[\"Moom, the true Chosen One\" by Onecolo133](#out:https://x.com/Onecolo133/status/1831681269106974738)",

            "content": "*Calli* had been working tirelessly—deadlines, projects, you name it. She decided it was time for a well-deserved break, going for a stroll with her beloved Deadbeats. But just as she was enjoying her walk, a truck crashed into her, knocking her out and sending her to the mysterious white box. How a truck managed to take down the literal incarnation of Death? No clue, but here we are.  \n<br>\n\n[And he takes another](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?t=331)\n<br>\n\n\nWhen Calli opened her eyes, confusion hit her like a second truck. She couldn't remember anything, everything looked boxy, voices were everywhere, and a chaotic red figure was [shouting](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=2575). Overwhelmed and disoriented, Calli managed to find a bit of solace after a brief, calming exchange with *Shakira*, who she quickly took a [liking to](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=893). Calli soon learned her name was *Mori Calliope*, thanks to the “floating text” above her head that everyone could [see](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=1658). \n<br>\n\n\nDuring the battle with the *Stain King*, Calli revealed her weapon: a [scythe](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=3259). Its Revelation? A deadly slash that cut through enemies with ease. After the battle, she was sorted into the *Jade Sword* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=3639), fitting her strong will and courage.\n<br>\n\n\nAs her journey began, Calli stumbled her way through learning the ropes: tackling quests, forming parties, and figuring out how to use the telekinesis device. Adapting wasn’t easy—she even struggled with entering and leaving the [kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=4875). But Calli’s resolve was unbreakable. When Frieda and some others kept riding their horses into her and Liz, Calli didn’t hesitate to declare she’d duel them if it meant setting things right.\n<br>\n\n[All talk and no balls](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=5481)\n<br>\n\n\nCalli eventually began building her own small [home](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=7457) in the kingdom. Later, she joined the Cerulean Cup members to take on the *Underworld Dungeon*. Before that, however, there was a bit of chaos when Liz, trying to pass as an Amber Coin member, accidentally got exposed by Calli, much to Liz’s dismay. Calli, blissfully unaware of the drama, observed the scene like a lost [child](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=8063).  \n<br>\n\n\n\nOnce inside the Underworld Dungeon with Tam and “The Hot Pink One”, Calli felt something familiar. The bony, eerie atmosphere resonated deeply within her. When she saw a giant skull statue, she instinctively called it [“Father”](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=11570). It wasn’t until they conquered the dungeon that her memories returned. She was *Mori Calliope*, a Grim Reaper who had rejected the traditional role of taking lives. Instead, she sought a higher purpose—finding beauty and joy in human emotion as a replacement for souls.\n<br>\n\n[Recollecting her true identity](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?t=12230)\n<br>\n\n\nThe return of her memories filled Calli with fear and guilt. She felt like a traitor for abandoning her duties and leaving her people behind. But Tam and her fellow adventurers reassured her, accepting her [unconditionally](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=12438). Afterward, Calli had another chat with Shakira and spent more time exploring the kingdom, preparing for the next dungeon with the Cerulean Cup members. She even got called “Dad” by Koseki Bijou, much to her [surprise](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=14424).\n<br>\n\n\nAt the end of the day—a day that included being hit by a truck, losing her memories, navigating chaos, and rediscovering herself—Calli took a moment to reflect. It had been wild, but it wasn’t the end. Her enigmatic journey was only just beginning, with many more adventures yet to come.\n",

            "content": "The first thing *Fauna* noticed upon waking in the white box was how absurdly [bright](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=8uBOHktGG-Kzh9WB&t=247) it was, folllowing up with a complaint about how loud everyone’s voices were. Complaining seemed like the logical first step when you’ve lost all your memories, right? \n<br>\n\nUnlike the other heroes, though, Fauna remained calm, collected, and entirely in control. It was as if she had done this before, casually remarking that the world reminded her of [\"Minecraft\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=s__Wo-nNYnk4VH3F&t=1682). Which explained her immediate urge to chop down a lone tree when she spotted one, it wasn’t just nostalgia—it was fueled by her OCD.\n<br>\n\n[I can't resist the urge](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=4SkKMgTqMYkdVuaV&t=2875)\n<br>\n\n\nDuring the battle with the *Stain King*, Fauna’s weapon made its debut: a wand topped with a [golden apple](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=c8218mEL2pzXTcr2&t=3173). Its *Revelation*, *“Instant Tipi”* as she named it, summoned a magical tipi-like dome that trapped enemies. More importantly, the wand also functioned as a healing tool, making Fauna the only one capable of providing support. \n<br>\n\nIn a brief exchange with the guildmasters, she mimicked the *Amber Coin* guild master’s accent, calling it “British”, and, knowing how \"good\" Fauna is at her accents, the voices in her head went into an immediate state of [panic](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=0_DR3pQaTV-Eefyw&t=3234). She was eventually sorted into the *Scarlet Wand* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=-WFwPJ36yVIN8B7Z&t=3441).\n<br>\n\n\nAfter entering the new world, Fauna began familiarizing herself with her surroundings. While completing a quest to slay stains, Fauna discovered something intriguing—she earned money for each stain defeated. The realization amused her, sparking a newfound joy. \n<br>\n\nThe stains were no longer just enemies to vanquish for the greater good—they were a source of [income](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=Ewua3iV9CrElQap3&t=5008). With dollar signs in her eyes, Fauna’s motivation shifted ever so slightly as she continued questing with her guildmates. \n<br>\n\n\nContinuing on, in a memorable moment involving *Shakira*, the lady in orange challenged *Gura* to float on water, given that she had a shark tail. Gura gave it a go and promptly drowned. Fauna, observing the entire fiasco, didn’t lift a finger to help (she did but only after Gura'd drowned). She did feel very guilty for her guild mate, however, because right after Gura cried out, *“HEALER? WHERE’S MY HEAL?”*, holding the support title, Fauna felt it was her resposibility to provide a sincere apoplogy, and so she replied:\n<br>\n\n[gg no re](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?t=6903)\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Fauna teamed up with her guildmates, Gura and Cecilia, to conquer the *Underworld Dungeon*, where they recovered memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=-eUxCKiyxKEaV8hA&t=9484). The trio then explored the world further, buying “gacha boxes” along the way. Gura pulled a ridiculously long, pointy hat, prompting Fauna to quip that she looked like a [garden gnome](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=k2bJ5eR6M8O7z9M6&t=10304). \n<br>\n\nThe two later dueled, with Fauna emerging victorious—and promptly extorting Gura for some loot, as a good guild mate [would](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=xCvDCmma03qWhWhk&t=11073). Their next adventure led them to a casino, where Fauna’s love of money truly shone. Betting everything on the color green—the color of money—she won a few rounds but lost just as many. Still, the thrill of the gamble fueled her, and despite her questionable behavior for a hero, she couldn’t get enough.\n<br>\n\n[It has to be green this time](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?t=11878)\n<br>\n\n\nAfter a long day of questing and gambling her life away, Fauna decided to call it a night. But something had awoken within her. It wasn’t the thrill of saving the world or helping people—it was the joy of money. Who knows where this newfound passion will lead her? Perhaps… a business empire?\n",

Her weapon, a [feather](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared&t=3110), revealed its *Revelation*: shooting magical beams at enemies, but she liked to refered to it as “tickling them to death.” After the battle, she was sorted into the *Scarlet Wand* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared&t=3347).\n<br>\n\n\n\nAs her journey began, Shiori embarked on quests with her guildmates, spending much of her time with her “goth” comrade Fauna, whom she affectionately called her wonderful majestic [green lady](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared&t=4218). In return, Fauna referred to Shiori as her wonderful majestic Oreo. Their conversations meandered through topics like dentists and places like 'hot topics', a prime example of what some might call [“yapping”](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared&t=4528).\n<br>\n\n\nUnlike the others, Shiori didn’t tackle the *Underworld Dungeon* on the first day, as she had other matters to attend to. Left alone with her thoughts, she began to question everything. She didn’t believe the town was real, suspecting it was part of a complex scheme to keep her memoryless because she was “too dangerous.” Shiori didn’t trust the King—or, as she put it, “this suspicious place.” Her skepticism ran deep, and her unpredictable mind continued to wander as her journey unfolded.\n<br>\n\n[Conspiracy theories](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?t=5588)\n",

It was a strange way to start, but oddly comforting amid the chaos. Like everyone else, Cecilia had no memory of her past—aside from knowing she liked [pizza](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=1090). \n<br>\n\n\nDuring the battle with the *Stain King*, Cecilia’s role was... questionable. She didn’t actually fight but justified her idleness by claiming to be “standing by as medic.” Shiori, also opted out of fighting, the difference is she didn't even have an excuse. \n<br>\n\n[The medic of the team](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?t=2950)\n<br>\n\nFor heroes summoned to save a kingdom, their approach was, well, unconventional. Eventually, Cecilia revealed her weapon: [a spear](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=3060). Upon activating its *Revelation*, it unleashed a flurry of rapid jabs against the enemy. She, like her 'watch mate' Shiori, was sorted into the *Scarlet Wand* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared&t=3347).\n<br>\n\n\nCecilia’s adventure officially began with great enthusiasm, especially after donning the [Libestal Cloak](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=3483). She started tackling quests with her guildmates, learning the basics of the world: communication devices, forming parties, and more. \n<br>\n\n\nLater, Cecilia teamed up with *Gura and Fauna* to take on the *Underworld Dungeon*. She had the most animated reactions during their journey, reacting dramatically to every [twist and turn](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=8277). Together, they conquered the dungeon and unlocked the memories of *[Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=9328)*. Afterward, the trio decided to hang out in the kingdom, exploring buildings, dueling, and purchasing “gacha boxes.” Gura’s prize—a ridiculously long hat—left Cecilia in fits of laughter.\n<br>\n\n[El em a o](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=10126)\n<br>\n\n\nTheir day didn’t end there. They ventured into a casino to test their luck. Cecilia and Fauna both bet on green (naturally, as green ladies). Cecilia faced some losses but managed to win back her money in the end—unlike Gura, who lost everything. Despite the ups and downs, Cecilia wrapped up her day feeling fulfilled, looking forward to more adventures with her guildmates and hoping the fun would continue.\n<br>\n\n[Green women whispering](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?t=12161)\n",

Although overwhelmed, she tried her best to start conversations with those around her, having small chats here and there. \n<br>\n\nHowever, her longest initial conversation was with a maiden in red, *Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame*. Their chat was simple introductions, but there was an undeniable sense of familiarity, like a deeper connection existed between [them](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=l3socXPAD6ViAdz6&t=1654). \n<br>\n\nThe voices in Nerissa’s head complicated things further by claiming Shiori was her [wife](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=IrdKxeAeyiGiGTRo&t=2831).

Upon activating its *Revelation*, she struck the fork against the enemy’s head, creating a shockwave dealing damage towards the enemy. After the battle, she was sorted into the Scarlet Wand [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=bBVH8rYcn0cL0hzO&t=3533).\n<br>\n\n\nVenturing into the new kingdom with her guildmates, Nerissa began adjusting to her new life. It was anything but smooth. She was baffled by the quest system, randomly earned [100 coins](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=Y5p-IBZHw__yD9o1&t=4842) without doing anything, got ambushed by [stains](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=ee1ikNmeMoYdUCkA&t=5226) while trying to gather wood, and “soft locked” Gura in a [trade](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=cGT81Dci8yieBCmn&t=5619). She was very much confused, and the voices in her head described her as having *\"wet cat energy\"*, whatever that meant. \n<br>\n\nDespite the chaos, Nerissa persevered, accompanied by the support and adoration of her guildmates, who found her quirks endearing.\n<br>\n\n[Bri'ish init](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?t=6344)\n<br>\n\n\nWhile exploring the kingdom, she overheard a peculiar conversation between [Tam and Raora](https://www.youtube.com/live/DDwNcYCtAXw?si=HEyqQCWXDnTaUrnB&t=474), watching in silent bewilderment as Raora laughed hysterically and Tam spiraled into frustration. “I feel like I just experienced something I wasn’t supposed to”, Nerissa muttered as she walked away. \n<br>\n\n\nLater, Nerissa teamed up with Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, and Raora to tackle the *Underworld Dungeon*. The experience was more amusing than frightening, especially when Nerissa watched her friends fall into a bottomless lava [pit](https://www.youtube.com/live/DDwNcYCtAXw?si=mGSwx70XvMtulrqg&t=3511). Despite the mishaps, they conquered the dungeon and recovered *[Mori Calliope’s](https://www.youtube.com/live/DDwNcYCtAXw?si=ceD6NIenRuYSxQYk&t=5176)* memories.\n<br>\n\n\nAfter a bit more wandering, Nerissa called it a day. It had been confusing, chaotic, and a little painful at times, but ultimately fun—and that was all that mattered.\n<br>\n\n[\"Scarlet Wand\" by tor](#out:https://x.com/torkirby/status/1830410419082510816)",

While many heroes claimed to have arrived through these methods, *Koseki Bijou's* tale stood out. She was crushed by a giant Moai statue, complemented with mutiple *vine boom sound effect*. \n<br>\n\n[*Boom*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?t=327)\n<br>\n\nOdd as it was, Bijou managed to arrive in the same mysterious white box as the others—that was what mattered. \n<br>\n\nThanks to something many referred to as a 'stream overlay', she knew her name was [Koseki Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=381). Being the curious little gem she is, she wasted no time running around asking the important questions—like whether Nerissa laid eggs, if Fauna was her mom, or if *Shiori* was her [lover](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=972). You know, totally normal, first-day-in-another-world stuff.  She also kept asking people to comment on her [feet](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=2669). \n<br>\n\n\nDuring the fight with the Stain King, Bijou showed off her weapon of choice: [two dazzling gems](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=3377) that launched an endless array of radiant gemstones at their foes. After that, she got sorted into the *Cerulean Cup* guild, joining the ranks of other not-so-normal heroes.\n<br>\n\nHer journey officially began in classic Bijou fashion—with a mix-up. She somehow (not deliberately) joined the [wrong](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=4058) party at first, but it was quickly resolved. While working on a quest outside the kingdom, she discovered a [sheep](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=4470) she grew strangely attached to and also developed an odd fondness for the world’s [rocks](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=5204). She hesitated to mine them, even though it was part of her task, feeling an emotional connection to them. \n<br>\n\nBijou later played a key role in the *Hot Pink One* incident, being the first to find her and calling in the rest of the guild for [support](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=5851). Despite her contributions, Bijou secretly claimed to be an *undercover agent of evil*, plotting to overthrow the system someday. She even went so far as to offer her assistance to Jyon Watson in assassinating the King, proving she’s more unpredictable than the King might have anticipated.\n<br>\n\n[Let me help you with that](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=6329)\n<br>\n\nAs her day continued, Bijou eventually, she teamed up with Nerissa, the two doggos, and later Raora to take on the *Underworld Dungeon*. Amidst plenty of chaos and [screaming](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fr6yMByDTIs?feature=shared&t=3318v), they managed to recover [Mori Calliope’s](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fr6yMByDTIs?feature=shared&t=4986) memories. But Bijou’s day didn’t end there.\n<br>\n\nTrue to her adventurous spirit—or questionable priorities—she decided to gamble all her money. Unsurprisingly, she lost [60%](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fr6yMByDTIs?feature=shared&t=7354) of it, but in her words: “99% of gamblers quit before they lose (?)” she persevered. Eventually, her luck turned around, and she won it all back.\n<br>\n\n[YEAHHHHHHH!!!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Fr6yMByDTIs?feature=shared&t=8864)\n<br>\n\nHer actions, however, may have raised some eyebrows among the voices in her head. After all, one of the supposed heroes of the realm turned out to be a gambling enthusiast who openly planned to overthrow the King that trusted them so. \n<br>\n\nBut despite her chaotic tendencies, Bijou’s day was eventful, and whatever lies ahead, her journey is sure to be just as unpredictable as she is. Whether her mischievous tendencies would lead to any kind of *corruption* remained to be seen.\n<br>\n\n\nOh and one more thing, wooden shovel.\n<br>\n\n[Wooden shovel](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Fr6yMByDTIs?t=7886)\n",

However, the harmonious image didn’t last long. Tensions flared when their rival guild, the Amber Coin, attempted to [kidnap](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?si=xE2vDkSE0e1yKT_w&t=5565) one of Cerulean Cup’s own, the so-called Hot Pink One. This act of aggression led the Cerulean Cup members to unanimously declare Amber Coin their worst enemy. Fortunately, our empaths eventually managed to retrieve their guildmate back.\n<br>\n\nGonathon G, though brave, wore his heart on his sleeve. His emotions ran high, and he was easily affected by the words and actions of others. For instance, he couldn’t help but cause a commotion every time he encountered Jyon Watson, the so accused King Killer (see [Gonathon-Jyon: King Killer](#edge:gonathon-g-ame-top-2-bottom-2)). \n<br>\n\n\nHe also grew visibly agitated when Elizabeth, one of Jade Sword's members, referred to him as [\"the loud one\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?si=xoXIP9Ni9qdFv1mJ&t=9070). And crying? Well, Gonathon did that often, for just about any reason. Whether it was Liz [\"hushing the gums\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?si=uOA9eA5-H_wGz8oT&t=7910) of the Hot Pink One, insulting his [long-forgotten mother](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?si=m_ePVuEIKMxJr459&t=6031), or even refusing to share her melons, Gonathon’s tears flowed freely.\n<br>\n\n[Baby crying](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?si=XQ3I0HtnRB2G2yhn&t=9151)\n<br>\n\n\nGonathon's first day wasn’t entirely marked by screams and tears. Many of the people he encountered treated him kindly, especially his guildmates. One person, however, stood out above all the rest. She wasn’t just any ordinary individual—she was destined to become the next Queen of this new kingdom. Moved by a sense of honor and purpose, Gonathon vowed his loyalty to her (see [Gonathon-Tam: You're the Queen!](#edge:gonathon-g-tam-gandr-bottom-2-left-2)).\n<br>\n\nAnyhow, alongside Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame and Nino Ina, he ventured into the *Underworld Dungeon*. Together, they recovered memories tied to [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?feature=shared&t=12343), taking their first steps in unraveling the mysteries of their fragmented pasts.\n\n",

Once she entered the Kingdom of Libestal, her presence made an immediate impact, transforming her lonely beginning into something much more dynamic.\n<br>\n\n\n\nAfter her exhausting and painful battle with the Stain King, she was officially sorted into the Cerulean Cup. Shortly after, she had her first encounter with the lively members of Amber Coin. That’s when <em>Shakira</em>, ever the opportunist, swooped in and attempted to recruit the pink one to her own guild instead. \n<br>\n\n\nLittle did Shakira knew, the pink one was not that of a simpleton. She was of someone loyal to her friends and true to the ideals of empathy, someone who would never betray her guild no matter what, it was her destiny to be that of the Cerulean Cup, and no forces would ever change such... She accepted Shakira's invitation without a second thought.\n<br>\n[Everyone wants the pink woman](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Rk7nZ91vme4?t=2087)\n<br>\n\nThis betrayal was short-lived, however.

After showcasing her unique Revelation, *Light and Darkness*, which some dubbed it similar to a [fart](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rk7nZ91vme4?si=uFnTUFLfBm36VZS-&t=2668), she threw herself into the day’s activities.

            "content": "*Ina's* introduction to the journey began much like everyone else's: waking up in the blindingly white box, disoriented and uncertain. Yet, her experience stood apart in her calmness. Unlike Peasant Da Bae's dramatic exclamations or Tam's barrage of questions, Ina approached the situation with a quiet sense of detachment, simply observing and taking it all in. Perhaps this was her nature—to remain composed and collected, even in the face of chaos. \n<br>\n\n[How is she so calm](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/THllQCVOYzY?t=240s)\n<br>\n\nThis trait became even more apparent during the battle with the Stain King, where she calmly wielded her Revelation—a magical book, [Violet Miasma](https://www.youtube.com/live/THllQCVOYzY?feature=shared&t=3183s)—while her companions screamed. When its ability was activated, the book unleashed radiant beams of energy that struck nearby enemies. Her serene demeanor and empathetic spirit naturally led to her being sorted into the *Cerulean Cup* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THllQCVOYzY&t=3425s). \n<br>\n\n\nAt first, Ina believed this journey might not be as daunting as she'd feared. The guild seemed filled with empathetic, heroic individuals, and the kingdom's tasks felt manageable. But her optimism soon wavered as she began to grasp the eccentricities of her guildmates. \n<br>\n\nDuring the dispute with Amber Coin over recruiting the Hot Pink One, Ina couldn't help but notice their [unusual antics](https://www.youtube.com/live/THllQCVOYzY?feature=shared&t=5761). Her concerns further deepened during confrontations with Elizabeth and Jyon Watson, leaving Ina to wonder: \n<br>\n\n\n[“Am I right to be in Cerulean?”](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/THllQCVOYzY?t=6125s)\n<br>\n\n\nDespite being surrounded by chaos, Ina embraced her role as the level-headed one in the group. She diligently completed her tasks, made puns whenever [inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/live/THllQCVOYzY?feature=shared&t=7603s) struck, and had [fleeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THllQCVOYzY&t=9680s) interactions with members of other guilds. Her day culminated in the *Underworld Dungeon*, where she teamed up with Elizabeth and Gonathon. \n<br>\n\n\nAfter successfully completing the challenge, she regained memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THllQCVOYzY&t=12389s). While most heroes chose to retire for the day afterward, Ina's adventures continued. She exchanged friendly [banter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THllQCVOYzY&t=14236s) with Nerissa, tackled additional quests, and stumbled upon a peculiar \"glitch\" that allowed her to [duplicate items](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THllQCVOYzY&t=17960s). True to her empathetic nature, she refrained from exploiting it and dutifully reported it to the Gods of the world.\n<br>\n\n\nAs her day drew to a close, Ina took on yet another self-imposed task: escorting the two doggos and Bijou to the shores, parting ways with the title of [\"Mysterious Hero I\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/THllQCVOYzY?feature=shared&t=18239s). She then decided to unwind in her own unique way—by [solo-conquering](https://www.youtube.com/live/THllQCVOYzY?feature=shared&t=19659s) the Underworld Dungeon. A peculiar choice for relaxation, but it was undeniably Ina. \n<br>\n\n\nDespite being placed in a guild full of quirky personalities, she remained calm at the center of the storm. Her composed demeanor and quiet strength suggested that she might just be the true hero the King had hoped for, one whose traits would carry her far in this enigmatic journey.\n<br>\n\n[What are they doing now...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/THllQCVOYzY?t=6842)\n",

And so, he summoned these nineteen heroes, placing his faith in them as the kingdom’s saviors, holding great hopes that they would rise to the occasion and fend off the terrible fate looming ahead.\n<br>\n\n[The King greets his heroes](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?feature=shared&t=2768)\n<br>\n\nAfter the heroes successfully defended the kingdom from the first wave of corruption, the King took notice of the strange power they possessed—Revelation. \n<br>\n\nIt was unlike anything he had seen before, and he believed it to be the key to defeating the Stains once and for all. With this newfound hope, he called upon the heroes, asking them to lend their strength, to embark on a long and arduous journey, and ultimately, to save the world. He entrusted the four guild leaders with guiding them, allowing them to explain their purpose and direction. And in doing so, he provided the heroes with a place to call home—where they would forge bonds, grow stronger, and prepare for the enigmatic journey ahead.\n<br>\n\n[Welcome to Libestal](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?feature=shared&t=3169)",

            "content": "*The maiden in blue* woke up in a peculiar white box, her first thought fixating on why everything—her hands, the world, even the people—appeared so square and pixelated. She roamed around asking anyone and everyone a barrage of questions: *“Is your name Kiara? What are you doing in the corner? The server closed? What does that mean?”* Her confusion was palpable, and it became evident that she couldn’t even recall her own name. \n<br>\n\n[Why is it so pixelated?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=390)\n<br>\n\n\nThis changed when she crossed paths with Gonathon G, who suggested the title *'The Azure Maiden'* because of her fondness for blue. While Kronii found it poetic, she also thought it was a bit too long. Gonathon shortened it to *'Tam'*, and Kronii, in her own flair, appended *Gandr*. Thus, her new identity was born—*Tam Gandr*\n<br>\n\n\nWhen summoned by the King alongside the other heroes, Tam felt a unique sense of destiny. Unlike the rest, she was convinced that the King’s fateful words, “Will you—” were the prelude to a royal proposal. Naturally, this meant she was destined to be his *Queen* (see Tam-King: Guess I'm Queen now). \n<br>\n\nBrimming with this belief, she shared her newfound 'truth' with *Peasant the Bae*, who became awestruck at the honor of standing in the presence of [royalty](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=1333). \n<br>\n\n\nDuring the battle with the *Stain King*, Tam unsheathed her weapons: a pair of dual-wielding blades shaped like clock hands, which upon activation, unleashed a relentless flurry of attacks. She was then sorted into the *Cerulean Cup* guild.\n<br>\n\n\nTam’s presence in Cerulean Cup quickly established her as a dominant figure, her charisma and aura of confidence naturally earning her respect as the guild leader. This was evident during the first major conflict in the kingdom, a heated recruitment battle between *Cerulean Cup and Amber Coin* over *the Hot Pink One*. \n<br>\n\nTam’s empathetic nature shone as she leveraged her remarkable powers of persuasion—a skill she had already demonstrated while aspiring a [Libestan child](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=5140). It was no surprise when The Hot Pink One eventually succumbed to her words, sealed with Tam’s unforgettable declaration: \n<br>\n\n[“Nobody wants you except us.”](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=6213)\n<br>\n\nAs the day progressed, Tam found herself caught in various shenanigans. Yet, she always managed to handle situations with an air of maturity. When Gonathon was interrogated by Elizabeth, Tam intervened, *calmly* defusing the tension (see [Elizabeth-Tam: Red and Blue](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-tam-gandr-top-3-top-2)). \n<br>\n\n\nBy the day's end, Tam joined The Hot Pink One and Mori Calliope in the *Underworld Dungeon*, where they recovered fragments of their lost [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=11965). It was a chaotic, exhausting day for Tam, filled with triumphs, conflicts, and laughter. She gained devoted followers who pledged their unwavering loyalty (see [Gonathon-Tam: You're the Queen!](#edge:gonathon-g-tam-gandr-bottom-2-left-2)). \n<br>\n\nBut above all, she found solace in the simple yet profound comfort of having a name—*Tam*. Though it was given impulsively by Gonathon, it resonated with her, becoming a cherished part of her identity. To Tam, that name was more than just a label; it was a symbol of her newfound self, one she would carry and treasure throughout the rest of her journey.\n<br>\n\nAs the kingdom settled into quiet, Tam yearned for a peaceful night’s sleep. Surely, nothing else would trouble her now. Surely... \n(see [Raora-Tam: Say my name](#edge:raora-panthera-tam-gandr-right-2-top-1)). \n<br>\n\n[\"Queen Tam Gandr\" by Daaku](#out:https://x.com/koizumi_arata/status/1830329272155931070)\n",

            "content": "*\"I want to punch this one. I don't know why, I just have an urge,\"* was one of the first things *Gura* said after waking up in the white room. The target? A blonde maiden named [Jyon Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=Y5cIDsVzAWQ_KLyt&t=535). It felt like there was unresolved tension between them—despite Gura not remembering anything about her past. Or maybe she was just feeling extra sassy, later casually calling Tam a dumbass when addressing her [name](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=DZTu5_2xTqaUWn3X&t=2562). \n<br>\n\nDuring the battle with the Stain King, Gura’s weapon— [a trident](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=iOr1m3bizOsFkBs6&t=3078)—was revealed. When she activated its Revelation, it summoned a wave of water that pushed back enemies. After the battle, she was sorted into the *Scarlet Wand* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=0VHccAIdMWhD0QQf&t=3413).\n<br>\n\n\nAnd so, Gura’s journey began. Like everyone else, her first task was figuring out this strange new world. She started doing quests with her guildmates but was confused most of the time—thanks to her [shork brain](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=6UmKNJggTOPF7KXR&t=5172). All sass, zero intelligence. Luckily, her guildmates included *Nerissa, Fauna, Shiori, and Cecilia*, who lived up to the Scarlet Wand's reputation for being smart. They carried her through most challenges. \n<br>\n\nNot everything went smoothly, though. She got involved in a [hit-and-run](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=SyZDDDTLhI0pvuNb&t=5252) incident with *Cleopatra Eisenhower Da Vinci The Great III* and, in another instance, drowned after accepting Shakira’s challenge to float on water. Yes, despite her shark-like features and literal tail, she somehow managed to drown.   \n<br>\n\n[A shark that drowns](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?t=6778)\n<br>\n\nLater, Gura teamed up with Fauna and Cecilia to tackle the *Underworld Dungeon*. During their conquest, Gura got an unexpected call from [Jyon Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=Zjtfn-It4RAxI-V-&t=7423), claiming to represent the 'Libestonian Charity'. Predictably, Gura saw through the scam and shut it down immediately. The trio conquered the dungeon, recovering memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=Jtp8XzHA_FLV9Wi9&t=9383), though not without some [screaming](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=Zst9EdhSWxT2Oh3-&t=7627) along the way.  \n<br>\n\n\nTheir day didn’t end there. The group continued exploring the world, with one highlight being the *gacha boxes*. Gura scored a ridiculous, long, pointy red velvet hat and proudly declared herself *The Appointed Point*. \n<br>\n\n[The Appointed Point](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?t=10161)\n<br>\n\n\nThe almighty Appointed Point didn’t stay mighty for long, as Fauna promptly beat her up and extorted some [loot](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=YkwgWZsNZ_jUp72e&t=10970). Turns out, the hat didn’t boost her strength—or intelligence. \n<br>\n\nFinally, the three of them wrapped up their day at the casino. While Fauna and Cecilia made decent profits, Gura went bankrupt, she lost so much money she couldn't feel her legs anymore. Again, the hat offered no perks. Despite that, she had a blast and was excited for whatever adventures lay ahead.\n<br>\n\n[\"A shark\" by Ammy](#out:https://x.com/Ammiietty/status/1830136980811796710)\n<br>\n\n[\"Big silly hat\" by toro rose](#out:https://x.com/TororoRose/status/1830139747202728375)\n<br>\n",

Elizabeth, a member of the same guild as Jyon, wasn’t about to let her guildmate be accused without defense (even if Jyon did plot to kill the King).

Neither backed down, but the feud escalated when Elizabeth claimed to be part of Amber Coin, a guild Tam utterly [despised](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=5964) (for some odd reason).

As everyone began to settle into their roles and understand the mechanics of this world, new bonds were forged, and the dynamics among the heroes grew even quirkier.\n<br>\n\n\nMarriages became the talk of the day: Gonathon and Jyon Watson tied the knot in an impromptu ceremony, Shiori and Bijou declared their undying love, and Nino Ina and The Hot Pink One became each other's eternal consort. The royal status Tam Gandr held, the 'Queen', also gained more attraction with its followers. \n<br>\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious faction known as *The Appointed Points* formed—a group connected telepathically by their distinctive pointy hats. Their bond was so profound that if one member were to remove their hat, the entire group would perish (or so they claimed). \n<br>\n\n[The Appointed Points' tips touching ritual](#image:images-opt/touchingtips.webp)\n<br>\n\n\nAmong the day's other notable developments was the grand opening of *FaunaMart*, a convenience store managed by Ceres Fauna. While Fauna claimed her establishment, complete with lottery tickets, was a gift for the community, skepticism abounded. Whispers of it being a scam circulated, with some heroes keeping a wary eye on the 'witch' and her growing enterprise.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBut amidst the shenanigans, the heroes did not forget their primary mission: to conquer the [*Ocean Temple Dungeon*](#out:https://x.com/hololive_En/status/1830425412440404160). This underwater labyrinth, reminiscent of the lost city of Atlantis, presented puzzles, secrets, and the allure of a hidden treasure, the most coveted prize of the day- the music disc titled *Reflect*. The dungeon proved to be a significant challenge, testing their teamwork and wit, but ultimately, they prevailed.\n<br>\n\n[The girls attempting the Ocean Temple Dungeon](#image:images-opt/oceantemple.webp)\n<br>\n\nIn completing the dungeon, the heroes unlocked another fragment of their forgotten past—this time, uncovering the story of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDnRHwpnIH4).\n",

While Fuwawa was only mildly interested to the pitch, Mococo was thoroughly intrigued, and her excitement dragged both Fuwawa and Liz to the newly opened convenience store.\n<br>\n\n\nFuwawa decided to try her luck and purchased a single [lottery ticket](https://www.youtube.com/live/jjCVWFJl-_o?feature=shared&t=903). Mococo, on the other hand, went all in, buying an astonishing sixty-eight tickets.

But amidst all the chaos, there was a comforting presence: the lady in red, Elizabeth, who promised to always stay by her side. That promise gave Mococo a sense of ease.\n<br>\n\n\nBeing the sociable doggo she was, Mococo wasted no time seeking companionship. She reached out to Raora and Elizabeth, asking if they’d be interested in tackling the second dungeon together. Both agreed, and with Fuwawa tagging along, Mococo excitedly went to group up. During their gathering, Mococo brought up a new establishment she’d heard about—*FaunaMart*. \n<br>\n\nShe had her eyes on the intriguing promise of lottery tickets being sold there. Before she could explain further, she received an ad call from Fauna herself, enthusiastically pitching the lottery and its grand prizes. While Elizabeth and Fuwawa seemed indifferent, Mococo was hooked. Without giving them much of a choice, she dragged the two to check out the shop. \n<br>\n\n[Let's go to FaunaMart!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/0rhoyO69kAQ?feature=shared&t=703)\n<br>\n\n\nAt FaunaMart, Mococo dove right in and bought her first lottery ticket. She reasoned it was best to play it safe—after all, this could be a scam. Therefore, Mococo, being the resposible doggo that she was, bought only one, two, three...four...sixty-eight tickets. She spent every last coin she had, her tail wagging with excitement. \n<br>\n\nElizabeth and Fuwawa exchanged worried glances as Mococo gleefully held her mountain of tickets, certain she’d struck gold. She assured Elizabeth that she’d soon be rich and promised to treat her friends once she hit the [jackpot](https://www.youtube.com/live/0rhoyO69kAQ?feature=shared&t=1310). Elizabeth, though still concerned, wished her the best of luck.\n<br>\n\n\n[68 tickets please!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/0rhoyO69kAQ?t=923)\n<br>\n\n\nWith their detour to FaunaMart complete, the group returned to focus on their goal: the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. They regrouped with Shakira and Raora, their companions for the dungeon conquest. Upon learning of Mococo’s excessive ticket-buying spree, Shakira couldn’t help but question her [decision](https://www.youtube.com/live/0rhoyO69kAQ?feature=shared&t=2368). Mococo was unbothered, she was determined that her decision was anything but wrong.\n\n<br>\n\n[Why did you buy so much...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/0rhoyO69kAQ?t=2365)\n<br>\n\nGetting back on track, the second dungeon proved challenging, but together, the group triumphed. They solved the puzzles, fought through peril, and recovered memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/0rhoyO69kAQ?feature=shared&t=4851). \n<br>\n\nAs the day drew to a close, Mococo felt fulfilled by their adventure. Her thoughts, however, lingered on the jackpot she was certain awaited her. With dreams of riches dancing in her mind, she settled down for the night, a smile on her face and her paws crossed for good fortune. As innocent as she was, this marked the beginning of a storyline nobody saw coming. \n<br>\n\n[\"Mogojan!?\" by Fukuinu](#out:https://x.com/fukuinu_daddy/status/1830478922934616529)\n<br>\n\n[\"they're going to the moon\" by karunochi](#out:https://x.com/karunochi/status/1830608765454024950)\n\n\n",

It was the moment Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame had sworn her unwavering loyalty to the fuzzy dog, Mococo. This memory wasn’t just a fleeting thought but a cornerstone of who she was, a defining piece of her identity. Elizabeth’s journey would be marked by such recollections, each day unearthing a new fragment that shaped her character and story.\n<br>\n\n[A fragment of memory](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?t=90)\n<br>\n\nWith the memory fading into the background, Elizabeth prepared to enter the kingdom. Upon arrival, she was greeted warmly by the doggy duo, [Fuwawa and Mococo](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=933). Their lively chat quickly set the tone for the day. Mococo excitedly asked if Elizabeth would join them in tackling the second dungeon and if she’d heard of the newly established FaunaMart.\n<br>\n\nJust as Elizabeth began to respond, an unexpected voice echoed in her mind. It was Fauna, delivering a telepathic advertisement for her new business. \n<br>\n\n[She's in my brain!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?t=1078)\n<br>\n\nThe red knight froze, startled by the direct intrusion into her thoughts. To Elizabeth, this wasn’t just clever marketing—it was witchcraft. The idea of a \"witch\" targeting her so brazenly filled her with unease, and she began to suspect that Fauna might wield dark powers.\n<br>\n\n\n\nDespite her apprehension, Elizabeth accompanied Fuwawa and Mococo to FaunaMart. The doggos, especially Mococo, seemed eager to investigate this mysterious store that sold lottery tickets. \n<br>\n\nAt the shop, Fauna welcomed them with her usual charm and started explaining how the lottery system worked. Elizabeth, however, remained vigilant, keeping a watchful eye on Fauna’s every move. To her, the long red hat Fauna wore was the mark of a witch, and she couldn’t shake the feeling that danger lurked beneath Fauna’s cheerful [demeanor](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=1231). \n<br>\n\n\nMococo, unbothered by Elizabeth’s suspicions, decided to buy not one, not two, but sixty-eight lottery tickets. The sheer extravagance left both Elizabeth and Fuwawa stunned, their concern growing with each ticket Mococo [purchased](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=1615).\n<br>\n\n\n\nAfter bidding farewell to the \"witch,\" the group turned their attention to the day’s main quest: conquering the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. Joining Elizabeth and the doggos were Shakira and Raora. The journey was fraught with challenges, including several failed attempts and plenty of [trolling](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=4122), but their persistence paid off.

Fueled by her distaste, Elizabeth wasn't going to let the blue maiden get the better of her this time (see [Elizabeth-Tam: Some queen, eh?](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-tam-gandr-top-3-top-2)).\n<br>\n\nLater on, Elizabeth refocused her efforts. She joined Shakira in uncovering the first dungeon’s secret treasure, a hidden music disc. The day ended on a brighter note as the group celebrated their success with a lively party at the [tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=10446).\n",

It wasn’t long before she found herself at the quest board, where she encountered Fauna, Darwin, and Cecilia. \n<br>\n\nThe group struck up a lively conversation, with Shakira and Cecilia bonding over their shared knowledge of German, with Shakira proclaiming it to be the language of the gods.\n<br>\n\n[Imagine not speaking German](#embed:(https://www.youtube.com/live/qKlzaYirN88?feature=shared&t=378))\n<br>\n\nFauna also enthusiastically introduced Shakira to her latest business venture—*FaunaMart*, a store offering local goods and lottery tickets.\n<br>\n\n\nWhile Fauna spoke with confidence about the “big jackpot” awaiting lucky customers, Shakira and Darwin exchanged skeptical glances. Something about the whole setup felt off, so Shakira decided to accompany the group to investigate this so-called convenience store. As Fauna continued to boast about the elusive jackpot without providing any evidence, Shakira’s suspicions deepened. She eventually warned Fauna that if her business turned out to be a scam, she wouldn’t hesitate to report it to Queen.\n<br>\n\n[This is definitely a scam](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qKlzaYirN88?feature=shared&t=1129)\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Cecilia invited everyone to join her German-learning quest. Shakira, still wary of the red hats, dismissed the idea, claiming she could teach German far better—boasting that her Germany was the [“superior Germany”](https://www.youtube.com/live/qKlzaYirN88?feature=shared&t=1335) (oh god not again). \n<br>\n\nRegardless, Shakira chose not to join the quest and went her ways. Later on, Darwin called Shakira through the telekenisis device, now suddenly speaking fluent German—a skill she had just acquired from Cecilia’s quest. It was a deliberate jab, and Shakira couldn’t help but feel annoyed by the scam call.\n<br>\n\n[Dieser Satz ist auf Deutsch](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKlzaYirN88?si=cYKwhcQJE8Dwtauq&amp;start=1719)\n<br>\n\n\nShakira stopped by Calli and Gonathon, using the opportunity to warn them about FaunaMart and the potential dangers posed by the red hats. Despite it only being her second day in the kingdom, Shakira’s keen sense of justice was already attuned to the undercurrents of deceit. Though her trust in others was beginning to waver, she found some comfort in her pink cat and her guildmates, at least these folks would never betray her...right? (see [Darwin-Shakira: Double Agent](#edge:kiara-moom-top-2-right-2)) \n<br>\n\nFast forward, when Shakira noticed Calli interacting with the red hats, seemingly on the verge of being scammed, she rushed to intervene. To her surprise, Calli assured her that she had the situation under control and revealed that she was, in fact, [scamming](https://www.youtube.com/live/qKlzaYirN88?feature=shared&t=2663) them instead. Although Shakira felt conflicted—knowing this only perpetuated the cycle of deception—she decided to trust Calli’s judgment and let her continue.\n<br>\n\nAs the day wore on, Shakira sought solace in the company of her pink cat, the one companion she felt she could truly rely on. Shakira then prepared herself for the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*, joining forces with Elizabeth, the pink cat, and the two doggos. Her sharp “RPG senses” guided the team to a hidden treasure—a music disc labeled Reflect. Pleased with the find, Shakira made a mental note to revisit the first dungeon to uncover its secrets [as well](https://www.youtube.com/live/qKlzaYirN88?feature=shared&t=9051).\n<br>\n\n\nAfter conquering the dungeon and recovering memories of Gawr Gura, Shakira returned to the kingdom. On her way back, she noticed that Queen Tam Gandr had awakened. Wasting no time, she approached the queen to report her suspicions about FaunaMart’s alleged scams, introducing herself as the savior of the ~~lesbians~~ Libestians in hopes of earning the queen’s trust.\n<br>\n\n[Never gets old](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qKlzaYirN88?feature=shared&t=9867)\n<br>\n\n\nAs the day drew to a close, Shakira, joined by Liz and Raora, ventured back into the first dungeon. Guided once again by her RPG instincts, she uncovered another hidden music disc, *\"Excuse me, can you please RIP\"*. She became the first adventurer to own this artifact, a small but satisfying [victory](https://www.youtube.com/live/qKlzaYirN88?feature=shared&t=13548) to end a chaotic day.\n",

She knew all too well that his loyalty was solely reserved for Tam Gandr, the so-called \"fake queen\", as Raora often referred to her. \n<br>\n\nHer disdain for Tam ran deep, and she took the moment to try and sway Shakira, claiming that she, Raora, was the true queen while Tam was nothing more than a pretender.\n<br>\n\n[\"She is FA KE! She is FA KE!\"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qDhyA4-79ko?t=696)\n<br>\n\nGetting back on track, Raora refocused on the day’s main objective: the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. She assembled her team, including Shakira, Elizabeth, and the two doggos, and together they embarked on the challenging journey. The adventure was anything but quiet, with bursts of shouting and chaotic moments scattered [throughout](https://www.youtube.com/live/qDhyA4-79ko?feature=shared&t=3654), but their determination paid off. In the end, they successfully recovered the memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/qDhyA4-79ko?feature=shared&t=4663).\n\n<br>\n\n\nUpon their return, they found themselves face-to-face with Tam Gandr and her guildmates at the quest board. Shakira knelt before Tam and brought up her concerns about the suspicious FaunaMart scam. Shakira’s act of loyalty was also a statement of trust—she saw Tam as the rightful ruler, much to Raora’s visible [displeasure](https://www.youtube.com/live/qDhyA4-79ko?feature=shared&t=6292). Raora couldn’t help but feel that Shakira’s allegiance should lie with her instead.\n<br>\n\n\nLater in the day, Raora crossed paths with Tam again, this time finding her in a heated argument with Elizabeth. Sensing an opportunity to rile Tam up, Raora wasted no time stirring the pot (see [Raora-Tam: Fake Queen](#edge:raora-panthera-tam-gandr-right-2-top-1)).\n<br>\n\n\nAfter cooling off, Raora joined Shakira in revisiting the first dungeon to uncover its secret treasure.

On day two, our owl girl proudly declared herself as [Darwin Roosevelt Dicaprio Jr., or simply Darwin](https://www.youtube.com/live/WQRPyJ4zhC0?feature=shared&t=322).\n<br>\n\n\n\nWeird and elaborate names aside, Darwin was ready to dive into her second day in the kingdom. Her first interaction was with Fauna, who was busy constructing her budding business, *FaunaMart*. \n<br>\n\nFauna explained her vision: a convenience store selling local goods and lottery tickets. Darwin was immediately skeptical, especially when Fauna claimed that “10% of ticket revenue goes to the library.” A quick visit to the library, which had a shockingly sparse collection of books, only deepened Darwin’s doubts (see [Darwin-Fauna: Shady Business](#edge:moom-ceres-fauna-top-1-left-2))\n<br>\n\n\n\nLater, the two made their way to the quest board, where they met Shakira, Cecilia, and Gura. True to form, Fauna began advertising her business again. Darwin, ever the skeptic, tried to warn the group about the potential scams, but her efforts were in vain as everyone became enamored with FaunaMart.\n<br>\n\n[No one understands me](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WQRPyJ4zhC0?feature=shared&t=2260)\n<br>\n\nAmid Darwin’s exasperated rants—especially about Fauna exploiting illiterate customers—the group veered off-course for a side quest initiated by Cecilia: learning German.\n<br>\n\n\nDarwin, being a self-proclaimed genius, picked up the language instantly, speaking fluently [in no time](https://www.youtube.com/live/WQRPyJ4zhC0?feature=shared&t=3180). Their antics continued with more lighthearted conversations, including a discussion about “satisfying videos for men” and Darwin’s untouched Kindle. \n<br>\n\n[Just hanging out with the gang](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WQRPyJ4zhC0?t=3758)\n<br>\n\n\nWhen it came time to try the hat gacha, Darwin surprised everyone by pulling the long hat (representing the Scarlet Wand guild) on her very first try. Gura, in particular, was left [flabbergasted](https://www.youtube.com/live/WQRPyJ4zhC0?feature=shared&t=3931).\n<br>\n\nOne standout moment came when Darwin reunited with her guildmate Shakira. Initially, Shakira accused Darwin of betraying the Amber Coin and joining the Scarlet Wand. But Darwin revealed that her apparent betrayal was part of her role as a spy (see [Darwin-Shakira: Double Agent](#edge:kiara-moom-top-2-right-2))\n<br>\n\n\nFinally returning to their main objective, Darwin, along with Gura and Cecilia, tackled the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. Upon conquering it, they successfully recovered Gawr Gura’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/WQRPyJ4zhC0?feature=shared&t=10437). Triumphant, the group returned to the kingdom, with Darwin entertaining everyone along the way with her trademark horse noises.

As Jyon was her guildmate, Calli made sure to extract a promise from Gonathon to take good care of his [wife](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared&t=704). Soon after, she encountered another newlywed couple—Shiori and Bijou.

Why not capitalize on the inevitable fallouts? What if she built a diner specializing in divorce services? Originally planning for a simple diner, she quickly pivoted to the more lucrative and unique angle of offering food alongside divorce consultations. \n<br>\nCalli was convinced this genius idea would make her rich. Fueled by excitement, she set out to lay the foundation of her new [venture](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared&t=1775).\n<br>\n\n\n\nOnce the basic structure of her diner was complete, Calli realized she needed to spread the word. She headed to the tavern to announce her grand business idea. However, to her disappointment, every married couple she approached rejected the concept outright, some with outrage. \n<br>\n\n[They'll soon see my vision](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?t=2360)\n<br>\n\nUndeterred by the backlash, Calli pressed on, coming up with a catchy slogan: [“Save your money, lose your honey”](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared&t=2550)\n<br>\n\nLater in the day, Calli joined a team to tackle the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. Her group included Nerissa, Jyon, and Ina. Together, they wracked their brains to solve the dungeon’s puzzles and eventually succeeded, recovering the memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared&t=5368).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs they emerged from the dungeon, Calli witnessed yet another impulsive wedding—this time between Ina and the Hot Pink One. While the rest of the group celebrated the union, Calli quietly smirked. She wasn’t cheering for their happiness but for the potential future customers her business might attract. [“They all start off so naive”](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared&t=5828), she mused as the newlyweds declared their eternal love. By now, Calli had a fitting name for her establishment:  \n<br>\n\n[*“Until Death Do You Part.”*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?t=5879)\n<br>\n\n\nBack in the kingdom, Calli resumed the diner’s construction. At some point, she received a [prank call](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared&t=8313) from Bijou, likely in retaliation for her constant jabs about Shiori and Bijou’s marriage falling apart. \n<br>\n\nReflecting on her new venture, Calli began to reconsider its premise. The harsh reception from the kingdom’s couples made her realize that her idea might be a little too cruel. As Calli had the revelation, she decided to revise her business model. She'd no longer be selling any kind of divorce services...instead, they'd come free with any meal purchased, [free of charge](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared&t=8229). Oh, Calli.\n<br>\n\nCalli held great hopes for her diner’s future. Love, after all, often ends in heartbreak, and when it did, she knew people would come for the divorces and stay for the food.\n\n\n",

It felt like destiny, she reasoned, considering her green hue was the same color as wealth. And so, on her second day, Fauna made a bold declaration: goodbye main quest, hello NPC life. Thus, *FaunaMart* was born.\n<br>\n\n[Man I Love Capitalism](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared&t=176)\n<br>\n\n\nThe concept of FaunaMart was as ingenious as it was dubious: a convenience store selling daily goods and necessities at a premium price and lower quantities than any reasonable competitor. Totally not a scam. But Fauna didn’t stop there; her real moneymaker was the store’s centerpiece—*lottery tickets*. \n<br>\n\nFor 10 coins apiece, customers could try their luck, with the promise that 10% of the proceeds would fund the construction of a community library, while 30% would go straight into her pockets.\n<br>\n\n[Man I Love Gambling](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?t=646)\n<br>\n\nConstruction of the cozy, wooden shop [began](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared&t=3387), and Fauna envisioned a charming establishment that would eventually sit beside the promised library (once the shop was complete, of course). It wasn’t long before Fauna found her first ~~victim~~ customer (see [Darwin-Fauna: Shady Business](#edge:moom-ceres-fauna-top-1-left-2))\n<br>\n\n\nWith her first sale secured, Fauna spread the word to her guildmate Cecilia, recruiting her to help sell more tickets. Together, they approached Shakira, but the orange lady proved a tough nut to crack. Shakira wasn’t just skeptical; she accused Fauna of exploiting people and declared the lottery an obvious *scam*. She even threatened to report Fauna to the queen, Tam Gandr. But Fauna, unfazed, dismissed the threat as an opportunity for free advertising.\n<br>\n\n[Sounds like easy PR](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared&t=11970)\n<br>\n\n\nAfter Shakira stormed off, Fauna and her guildmates resumed their day. They embarked on a brief side quest to learn [German](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared&t=12106), witnessed Darwin winning the coveted long red hat from the gacha (and joining the red hat club via [tip-touching ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared&t=13042)), and engaged in their usual shenanigans. Fauna also had a hilarious encounter with Calli, who managed to outsmart her during an attempt to sell [more tickets](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared&t=13530).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs the day progressed, Fauna had to part ways with her guild before the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. However, not one to miss an opportunity, she turned to telemarketing to promote FaunaMart. Her unconventional approach involved reaching out to potential customers like Bijou, Fuwawa, Mococo, and Elizabeth, the latter being understandably startled when Fauna seemed to speak directly into her mind. \n\n<br>\n\n[Telemarketing at its finest](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?t=14874)\n<br>\n\nDespite the cheapness of the tactic, it proved effective, bringing in three [new customers](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared&t=15005). Elizabeth and the doggos alone contributed significantly to Fauna’s sales, with Mococo purchasing a whopping 68 tickets. FaunaMart, it seemed, was off to a booming start. \n<br>\n\nBusiness was flourishing, and Fauna’s entrepreneurial spirit showed no signs of slowing down. But as promising as her future appeared, one couldn’t help but wonder: would her questionable business practices eventually lead to lawsuits? Only time would tell.\n<br>\n\n[\"Do it for the library\" by Chaleko](#out:https://x.com/Chalek0/status/1830748696935313524)",

She enlisted the help of Koseki Bijou and Jyon, with the latter also hadn’t ventured into the dungeon yet. \n<br>\n\nWhile waiting for their fourth teammate, a bizarre, chaotic, and utterly Shiori-esque conversation unfolded—somehow the three managed to diverged the conversation topic from simple introductions, to discussions about milking, biting feet, and eating as*. Such peculiar topics had become par for the course when Shiori was around. \n<br>\n\n[Are you milking that for content?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?t=790)\n<br>\n\n\nAnyway, back to the matter at hand. The group successfully conquered the dungeon, and though Shiori was a bit late to the party, she managed to recover memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=2480). Following this achievement, she witnessed the marriage ceremony of Gonathon and Jyon Watson (almost derailing it with one of her offhand [comments](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=2936)) and then took a slight detour to the [casino](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=3553).\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Shiori ventured to the entrance of the second dungeon, the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. She had initially planned to tackle 'the land of the moist world' with Koseki Bijou, but Bijou was already committed to joining her guildmates. Undeterred, Shiori reached out to others for help, but everyone was busy. So, in a moment of boldness (or recklessness), she decided to attempt the dungeon [solo](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=4066).   \n<br>\n\n\nBarely a minute into the dungeon, Shiori began to feel the sting of solitude. Seeking some semblance of company, she called Nerissa via the telekinesis device and filled the silence with random chatter (see [Shiori-Nerissa: Keeping Company](#edge:shiori-nyavella-nerissa-ravencroft-bottom-2-top-2)). \n<br>\n\nBut as the dungeon progressed, her initial confidence gave way to mounting frustration. The puzzles proved far more challenging than anticipated, and Shiori’s patience quickly wore thin. \n<br>\n\nShe spent over ten minutes grappling with the second puzzle and another fifteen painstakingly trying to unlock a secret treasure chest, mistakenly believing it was necessary to progress. When she finally realized it was optional, her frustration hit its [peak](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=6303). However, after much struggle, she managed to conquer the dungeon, recovering memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=6804). The victory brought a mix of pride and exhaustion. \n<br>\n\n\nAfter the mental ordeal, Shiori returned to the kingdom to unwind. At one of the taverns, she encountered Tam Gandr, engaging in a surprisingly sensual conversation (they only showed each other their weapons, don't get it twisted). \n<br>\n\n[I showed you my sword](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=7805)\n<br>\n\nThe day ended on an unexpected note when Bijou confessed her feelings to Shiori. To her own surprise, Shiori accepted, and the two consummated their newfound relationship... in front of the cows (see [Bijou-Shiori: Seeds and Eggs](#edge:shiori-nyavella-koseki-bijou-right-2-left-2)).",

            "content": "One of the first things Cecilia did on her first day was having a conversation with Shakira in German, a language only the two of them knew. And, in a similar fashion, one of the first things Cecilia did on the second day was, you guessed it, another conversation with Shakira in [German](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=394). Seems fair—when you're one of only two people fluent in some ancient, mystic language, you make use of it. \n<br>\n\nDuring her morning greetings, Fauna approached Cecilia to introduce her new business venture: *FaunaMart*, a convenience store selling daily necessities and, of course, the star product—lottery tickets. Cecilia was intrigued and decided to support her fellow green compatriot by buying four tickets. \n<br>\n\nSince they were both in the same guild, Scarlet Wand, Cecilia went a step further and helped Fauna sell more tickets. She even tried convincing Shakira to buy some, offering her a special discount. Scam or not, Cecilia felt it was her duty to back up Fauna’s efforts as a fellow entrepreneur.\n<br>\n\n[\"You get a German discount!\"](#embed:(https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=1306))\n<br>\n\n\nNot long after, Cecilia demonstrated to Fauna, Gura, and Darwin how she learned German in three minutes during a self-made [sidequest](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=1401). The quest involved talking to random German-speaking civilians and, somehow, just by listening, gaining the skill like in a video game. The group was skeptical but impressed, especially when Darwin managed to speak [fluently](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=1537) after only a short while. Oddly enough, her voice seemed to change slightly whenever she spoke German, but everyone chalked it up to their imagination.\n\n<br>\n\n\nCecilia then decided it was time to try her luck at obtaining a red hat—an item many of her guildmates already owned. Unfortunately, she had no success, while Darwin, who didn’t even need the hat, got one on her first try. Cecilia was visibly disappointed, but her friends rallied around her to cheer her up, combining their long hats into a [small tipi](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=2471) as a gesture of support.\n<br>\n\n\nThe day continued with Cecilia joining Fauna in trying to sell lottery tickets to Calli, the Grim Reaper herself. However, the tables quickly turned, and the two found themselves on the [receiving end](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=2754) of a scam instead. Business ventures aside, Cecilia’s sharp mind began noticing oddities about the kingdom.  \n<br>\n\n[Cecilia's (crackhead) theory about the king](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?t=3368)\n<br>\n\nShe shared her suspicions with Fauna, Gura, and Darwin, theorizing that the King might be turning the kingdom’s people into the \"stains\" they were sent to fight. What’s more, despite being tasked with clearing dungeons, there were no stains to be found in them. Her suspicions deepened after overhearing and overanalyzing the words (a bug) of a civilian.\n<br>\n\n\nAfter wrapping up their conspiracy discussions, Cecilia, Gura, and Darwin headed to the second dungeon, the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. After navigating multiple puzzles—and, of course, [overthinking](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=8274) most of them—they successfully completed the dungeon and helped Gawr Gura recover her lost [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=8878). \n\n<br>\n\nExhausted from the mental gymnastics, the group decided to unwind at the casino. Cecilia, just like on the first day, bet all her money on green—and [lost it all](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=9993). Undeterred, she roamed the area looking for someone to lend her money. She eventually found Gonathon, who agreed to trade 9 sticks for 50 coins. With newfound confidence, Cecilia returned to the casino, bet everything on green once more... and lost it all again.\n<br>\n\n[It's over...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=10831)\n<br>\n\n[\"The Appointed Points\" by Hiro](#out:https://x.com/hiroavrs/status/1830628289926557835)\n<br>\n\n[\"Tipi\" by Moonia](#out:https://x.com/BloodyMoonia/status/1830726627686588557)\n<br>\n\n[\"The secret technique of the Scarlet Wand guild\" by Chaleko](#out:https://x.com/Chalek0/status/1830482782222426481)\n",

Unfamiliar with the context, she simply observed with amusement, smiling as the chaos unfolded. At one point, she tried sparking a conversation with Jyon Watson. However, her natural womanizing aura led Gonathon to mistakenly assume she was flirting with his wife, earning her a sharp scolding.\n<br>\n\n[Bro chill we were just talking](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/nHn2JKHTyzM?t=2501s)\n<br>\n\nNerissa then began construction on a humble [pink house](https://www.youtube.com/live/nHn2JKHTyzM?feature=shared&t=4996) to serve as a communal storage and hangout space for her Scarlet Wand guildmates. She even managed to get her hands on the [coveted long hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/nHn2JKHTyzM?feature=shared&t=6016) she'd been eyeing.\n<br>\n\n\nWhile she paused construction to join other heroes on a journey to the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*, Nerissa found herself in a team with Ina, Calli, and Jyon.

The voices in her head begged her to stop for her own good, but like any true addict, she kept going, muttering, “just one more round.” Despite starting the day as one of the richest heroes with over 1,500 coins, by the end, Nerissa had whittled her fortune down to a mere... 92.\n<br>\n\n[One more game, she said](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/nHn2JKHTyzM?t=11250)\n",

She resolved to be a \"nice person\" and help Shiori conquer the first dungeon, as Shiori hadn’t managed to finish it the day before. Jyon Watson found herself in a similar predicament, so she tagged along as well, enlisting Gonathon’s assistance. \n<br>\n\nNaturally, it wouldn’t be normal for these girls to proceed without some level of absurdity. Before entering the dungeon, a bizarre conversation unfolded—one involving the idea of milking Shiori, biting Bijou’s feet, and the questionable stains on the King’s pants.\n<br>\n\n[Milking and licking feet](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?si=yn517X-yzXmBKacT&amp;start=963)\n<br>\n\nAfter completing the dungeon, Bijou had the honor of witnessing Gonathon's [marriage](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=3111) to his wife, Jyon Watson. But, as if on cue, she soon caught the Hot Pink One attempting to flirt with the newlywed bride. Being the good guildmate she was, Bijou promptly alerted Gonathon, who rushed over to reclaim his [beloved](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=4490). \n<br>\n\nHaving done her good deed for the day, Bijou then dragged her companions to the casino to indulge her gambling addiction, intent on finally earning enough money to buy the hat she had been longing for since day one.\n<br>\n\nDespite Bijou’s persistent invitations, Gonathon refused to enter the casino. As a man of principle, he couldn’t bring himself to step into the Amber Coin vicinity—it would be a betrayal of his ideals. Tired of his moral high ground and whining, Bijou hit him where it hurt. \n<br>\n\nRemember her earlier noble act of informing Gonathon about the Hot Pink One’s advances on his wife? Well, forget that. Bijou made a cruel but effective move: she called Gonathon, claiming the Hot Pink One was committing unspeakable acts with his Pearl. Gonathon, panicked and teary-eyed, sprinted to find his wife. It was all just a ruse, but it was as low as it was clever.\n<br>\n\n[Can you stop crying?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?t=5016)\n<br>\n\nHaving gambled her life away once again and educating Gonathon on how hand-holding could lead to [pregnancy](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=5401), the group decided to meet their queen, Tam Gandr. Gonathon explained to Tam about the FaunaMart lottery scam, and, unsurprisingly, the mere mention of \"lottery\" triggered Bijou’s gambling instincts. Like a wild beast, she bolted to the quest board, screaming [\"Gacha! Gacha!\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=6431) at the top of her lungs. \n<br>\n\nAt the quest board, the group encountered Elizabeth, who challenged Tam to a duel. Ever the loyal servant, the Hot Pink One stepped up to fight in her queen’s stead and emerged [victorious](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=7239). Riding on her momentum, she challenged Bijou next. As expected of someone who spent most of her time gambling rather than honing her skills, Bijou was promptly defeated, losing not just the duel but also her dignity. \n<br>\n\n[Dignity perms lost](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=7511)\n<br>\n\nLater, the group’s antics continued—Bijou adopted a pet rock, only for the Hot Pink One to, uh, [“fart”](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=7926) on it, which allegedly [killed it](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=7856). Amidst all this, however, something truly significant occurred: mustering all her courage, Bijou confessed her love to Shiori. A small but peculiar ceremony followed, and the two consummated their union (see [Bijou-Shiori: Seeds and Eggs](#edge:shiori-nyavella-koseki-bijou-right-2-left-2)).\n<br>\n\n\nReturning to the task at hand, the team regrouped and prepared to tackle the *Water Temple Dungeon*. Before entering, Ina hosted an auction for her hat. Although Bijou coveted the hat, she decided she wanted to earn her own through her own [efforts](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=11244), so she refrained from bidding. Alongside Tam, Gonathon, and the Hot Pink One, Bijou successfully conquered the dungeon and helped recover memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=13002). Yet another marriage took place afterward, this time between the Hot Pink One and Nino Ina.\n<br>\n\n\nAfter the dust settled, Bijou decided to test her luck one last time to win a hat before calling it a day. But alas, fortune was not on her side. She ended her day empty-handed and dejected, her dreams of a hat left unfulfilled.\n<br>\n\nBefore she headed off, wooden shovel.\n<br>\n\n[Wooden shovel](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?t=10815)\n",

Jyon and Shiori hadn’t managed to conquer the dungeon on the first day, so this was their chance to catch up. \n<br>\n\nHowever, before venturing into the depths, a bizarre conversation unfolded, leaving Gonathon bewildered. The group revisited their shared goal of slaying the King—a plan initially sparked by Jyon’s motives. For Gonathon, the King’s corruption was a reason to free him. For the others? The goal seemed more… recreational.  \n<br>\n\n[What is this conversation](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?t=35)\n<br>\n\n\nAfter clearing the dungeon, Gonathon’s day only grew more eventful. A surprising twist came in the form of a small marriage ceremony, binding him and *Jyonathan* in holy—or perhaps chaotic—matrimony (see [Gonathon-Jyonathan: My Pearl!](#edge:gonathon-g-ame-top-2-bottom-2)). \n<br>\n\nThe day wasn’t done with its events. Joined by his guildmates, Gonathon reported recent kingdom happenings to Queen Tam Gandr, including a scam orchestrated by the Scarlet Wand guild involving fraudulent [lottery tickets](https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared&t=5324). At the quest board, while seeking more information about the scam from Shakira, the group encountered Elizabeth, sparking immediate tension. Cerulean Cup braced for confrontation. \n<br>\n\nA duel was proposed, and the Hot Pink One volunteered to fight in her Tam's [steed](https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared&t=5963). Amidst these antics, Cecilia ~~stole~~ asked Gonathon if he were able to lend her 50 coins, after ~~lying~~ saying she was Jyon's guild mate, to which Gonathon, representing that of empathy, did exactly just that. The loan was never [repaid](https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared&t=6001).\n<br>\n\n\nThe duel concluded with a victory for the Hot Pink One, allowing everyone to continue with their day. Gonathon, ever the romantic after his own whirlwind marriage, encouraged Bijou to confess her feelings to Shiori. She did, and the confession culminated in another accepted marriage—love seemed to be the theme of the day.\n<br>\n\n[Watching a consumation](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared&t=7406)\n<br>\n\n\nAs the day neared its end, preparations for the *Ocean Temple Dungeon* began.

His wife was safe, at least for the moment (see [Hot Pink One-Jyonthan: Plan B](#edge:ame-hot-pink-one-left-2-bottom-2)).\n<br>\n\n\nAfter the interruption, Bijou invited the group to the Amber Coin casino to try their luck. Despite being part of the Guild of Empathy, Bijou was surprisingly enthusiastic about gambling. The Hot Pink One, while losing her coins at the tables, couldn't help but express envy towards Gonathon, wishing for someone special in her life. Gonathon offered her encouragement, assuring her that her special someone would come along eventually. \n<br>\n\n[I want a wife too](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=nwACILNXWJZkRlZU&t=1439)\n<br>\n\n\nLater, the group regrouped with their queen, Tam Gandr, where Gonathon explained the ongoing lottery scam, ran by FaunaMart, plaguing the kingdom. The mere mention of lotteries immediately piqued the Hot Pink One’s interest, prompting her to dash off under the excuse of [“examining the evidence”](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=aZFVkqHOS5Ib3_sH&t=2531). It wasn't until her queen’s stern intervention was she finally reeled [back in](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=nZQemPteok063cLW&t=2750).\n\n<br>\n\nAt the quest board, Elizabeth also appeared, and the Hot Pink One couldn’t forget the indignity of having her gums 'hushed' by the Red One. When Elizabeth challenged Tam to a duel, the Hot Pink One boldly volunteered, determined to reclaim her [dignity](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=WTxfOOnZS6zsf83c&t=3123). Though ker courage [wavered](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=5r5vNNmzoIjXRPGu&t=3136) briefly upon seeing Elizabeth’s formidable weapon, she pressed on nonetheless.  \n<br>\n\n[Fighting for her dignity](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?t=3316)\n<br>\n\nIn the duel, the Hot Pink One emerged victorious. Elizabeth’s excuses about a “Ping Ghost” didn’t matter—victory was hers. Empowered by her win, she sought another opponent to satiate her newfound hunger for battle. She turned to Bijou and challenged her guildmate to a [duel](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=A-sxFCAwk8h7m671&t=3638). Another win followed, leaving Bijou defeated and the Hot Pink One now claiming [double](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=oNpLE1mN_HFpM6Jf&t=3666) the dignity, whatever that meant.\n<br>\n\n\nThe day’s events continued with the Pink One 'accidentally' killing Bijou’s pet [rock](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=purywjxey_noU_DD&t=3974), partying at the [tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=0B4-qaOCsa2OupoT&t=6275), and finally preparing for the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. \n<br>\n\nAt the dungeon’s entrance, the group discussed how their teams should be split, with the Pink One joining Gonathon, Tam, and Bijou. Meanwhile, Nino Ina mentioned auctioning her hat. Initially uninterested, the Pink One’s demeanor shifted entirely when she learned the hat carried Ina’s scent. Fueled by newfound enthusiasm, she purchased the hat for a steep 600 coins.\n<br>\n\n[Mmmmm, smells like her](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=zn5oNkKqFzUfNvDI&t=7400)\n<br>\n\nInside the Ocean Temple Dungeon, the Hot Pink One surprised everyone, including herself, by excelling at puzzles—a rarity given her usual disposition. She credited her newfound intellect to Ina’s hat, which she now considered a source of luck and inspiration. Her team successfully conquered the dungeon, recovering memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=X8em6vc_K7PpG1Mh&t=9178). \n<br>\n\nFeeling emboldened by her achievements and newfound clarity, the Pink One realized her feelings for Nino Ina and proposed (see [Hot Pink One-Ina: Enertal Consort](#edge:hot-pink-one-nino-ina-right-2-left-2))\n\n",

            "content": "Ina re-entered the fantasy world for her second day, the chaos of the first still fresh in her mind. Yet, somehow, the absurdity of her guildmates had already become her new normal. The moment she arrived, she found herself dragged into a [lively tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=364), where familiar tunes blared, and her companions, along with other guild members, danced with reckless abandon. Ina didn’t comment much, though; she had grown accustomed to this bizarre kingdom. \n<br>\n\nSoon after, the Hot Pink One approached her, [inviting her](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=816) to join in the conquest of the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*.\n<br>\n\n\nBefore the dungeon crawl began, Ina decided to hold an auction for her [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=1050). The bidding started with mild interest, but things escalated quickly when Ina casually mentioned that the hat carried her scent. That one detail flipped a switch in the Hot Pink One, who had initially shown no interest but suddenly offered a staggering 600 coins.\n<br>\n\n[Going once, going twice](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=1167)\n<br>\n\nWith the auction concluded, Ina assembled her team, which included Nerissa, Calli, and Jyon, and together they tackled the dungeon. \n<br>\n\nThe team emerged victorious, recovering memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=3134) along the way.\n<br>\n\n\nAfter leaving the dungeon and taking a moment to mine for materials, Ina was pulled aside by the Hot Pink One. What followed was an unexpected and heartfelt proposal. The pink lady attributed their success to Ina’s hat and confessed that Ina was her one and only. Touched by the gesture, Ina accepted and vowed to be her eternal consort, sealing their unconventional union (see [Hot Pink One-Ina: Eternal Consort](#edge:hot-pink-one-nino-ina-right-2-left-2)).\n<br>\n\n\nIna’s day continued in her signature serene fashion. Unlike most, she avoided the kingdom’s typical madness. She took on quests, explored the land, and engaged in calm conversations—an unusual rarity in a realm dominated by chaos. Even during her interactions with her guildmates, she maintained a steady demeanor, though her wife’s overly [questionable comments](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=4239) often drew a subtle smile.\n<br>\n\n\nThere were some quirky moments amidst her otherwise tranquil day. Ina, in a rare slip, attempted to flirt with Tam, an incident she quickly brushed off as a result of her \"Oya Oya\" charm. \n<br>\n\n[Aren't you married?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=6629)\n<br>\n\nShe then spent time observing Calli’s \"dad-like\" [tendencies](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=7411), which drew genuine laughter from Ina. She also encountered Nerissa and smugly flaunted her diamond sword. These one-off interactions offered a refreshing change and gave her a chance to better understand the kingdom’s many personalities.\n\n<br>\n\n[Ina showing off her diamond sword](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/z4R10dPeuwY?si=GDfvf9GNu8D0JHOx&amp;start=7120)\n<br>\n\nAs night fell, Ina made an unusual decision: she chose to tackle the Ocean Temple Dungeon solo for a [second time](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=9950). Perhaps she was drawn to the thrill of \"solo leveling,\" relishing the challenge it offered.\n\n",

            "content": "The new (self-proclaimed) *queen of Libestal* awoke for the second day, and it seemed action was the theme of the day. As soon as Tam joined the kingdom, Bijou summoned her for [immediate assistance](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared&t=307) while informing her that Gonathon had been wedded. At the same time, Tam received a secret message from Shakira about an evil force—FaunaMart—scamming people through lottery tickets. Intrigued, the queen wasted no time and hurried to join her guild mates.\n<br>\n\n\nWhen she arrived, the first thing everyone pointed out was her \"Xbox-like\" [voice](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared&t=561). Tam, being self-conscious about it, tried to brush it off but couldn’t help feeling embarrassed. \n<br>\n\nRegardless, there were more pressing matters. Gonathon explained the lottery scam situation, but at the mention of \"lottery\", both Bijou and the Hot Pink One, notorious gambling addicts, dashed to the quest board. Tam's desperate attempts to stop them were futile, and with no other choice, she followed her reckless guild mates.\n<br>\n\n[Listen to me!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?t=816)\n<br>\n\nAt the quest board, Shakira shared more about the scams. Midway during this, Elizabeth appeared, reigniting the rivalry between her and Tam. Liz, unaware of Tam's name, referred to her as \"Tim\", much to Tam's irritation. Insults flew—Tam calling Liz a \"red thing\" and a harlot, sentencing her to death, while Liz retaliated with equal fervor. The heated exchange reached its peak when Liz challenged Tam to a duel ([see Elizabeth-Tam: Some queen, eh?](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-tam-gandr-top-3-top-2)) \n<br>\n\n\nAs a queen, Tam declared it beneath her, not because she was afraid, not at all, but she claimed as the Queen, violence was not a suited act. She instead asked a subordinate to step in. The Hot Pink One volunteered, eager to settle her score with Liz. After an intense battle, the pink one emerged victorious, to Tam's delight.  \n<br>\n\n\nTam's day carried on with the usual shenanigans: completing quests, sharing a [sensual moment](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared&t=2332) with Shiori, being called \"queen dum dum\" by Calli, and much more. \n<br>\n\n[It's just a joke?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared&t=2921)\n<br>\n\n\nEventually, the group prepared for the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. After clearing its challenges and recovering Gawr Gura’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared&t=7458), Tam witnessed another guild mate's marriage. This time, the [Hot Pink One](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared&t=8043). This time, it kinda stung. \n<br>\n\nTam later admitted she had feelings for the pink one, making this yet another reminder of her loneliness. Though accustomed to being alone, the sight of her wedded guild mates left her longing for someone special. Nevertheless, Tam continued her day, she was Queen after all, and queens never cry (see [Tam-Hot Pink One: Unrequited Love](#edge:hot-pink-one-tam-gandr-top-3-left-3)).\n<br>\n\nTam thought that at the very least, she could provide shelter for her followers. Despite her envy, she still treasured them deeply. With this resolve, Tam set out to build the [guild base](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared&t=11310). \n<br>\n\nWith occasional help from Gonathon and Ina, and after overcoming moments of [frustration](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared&t=17819), the foundation slowly began to take shape. She hoped to finish it soon, as her departure for important business loomed closer, she feared that she would not be able to spend more time with her silly friends soon. Tam wished that by the time she left, her guild mates would have a place they could call home.\n",

This hat was no ordinary accessory; it symbolized intelligence and status, qualities Gura was quick to claim as her own. \n<br>\n\nShe began her day at the quest board, where Fauna, Cecilia, Darwin Roosevelt DiCaprio Jr., and Shakira were deep in discussion about the FaunaMart lottery tickets. Darwin attempted to sell Gura a ticket, but she was already ahead of the game. According to Gura, those who wore the red hat shared a single brain. \n<br>\n\nShe proved her point by revealing that, despite not being present, she already knew about the lottery tickets thanks to a prior conversation between Fauna, who was also donning the red hat, and Darwin. To solidify her claim, she tested Fauna by asking what she was thinking, and Fauna’s correct answer affirmed the power of the red hat.\n<br>\n\n[The Appointed Point's power](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?t=648)\n<br>\n\nThe group then investigated the source of the day’s buzz: the under-construction *FaunaMart* convenience store. Fauna enthusiastically explained her lottery system and how it could benefit the kingdom, though Shakira remained skeptical. Cecilia stepped in, offering the allure of a [“German discount”](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=1123), a mysterious incentive that segued into a side quest where the group attempted to learn [German](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=1210).\n<br>\n\n\nAfter fully mastering German in just 5 minutes, their antics resumed as Fauna forced Gura to buy a lottery ticket, sprinkled with discussions about [\"ice-breaking\" videos](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=1785) and Darwin’s unused [\"kindle\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=1937). \n<br>\n\nThey then turned their attention to gacha boxes, with Cecilia determined to win the long red hat and join the exclusive club. Her attempts ended in disappointment, but Darwin, in a twist of fate, won the hat on her first try. This unexpected outcome startled Gura, greatly.\n<br>\n\n[This has never happened before](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?t=2111)\n<br>\n\n\nShe warned Darwin of the immense responsibility and stress tied to being part of the Appointed Points. Darwin solemnly accepted the role, sealing the pact with a ceremonial touching of tips.\n<br>\n\n\nWith their new (unofficial) member in tow, the group attempted to scam Calli into buying [lottery tickets](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=2658) before bidding Fauna farewell and preparing for the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*.\n<br>\n\n\nAs the conquest began, Gura felt a strange sense of familiarity. The oceanic decor, ~~aircrafts~~ [dolphin statues](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=5735), and subtle hints of lore stirred memories of a life long forgotten. It felt personal, as if this dungeon was somehow tied to her. Determined to uncover the truth, the group pushed forward through puzzles. \n<br>\n\nThe challenges ranged from baby block-like mechanisms (which inexplicably [offended](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=5870) Gura) to intricate switches and a final contraption requiring them to [guide a dummy](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=6604) to its goal. Despite the difficulty, the team persevered, uncovering a hidden treasure: a music disc labeled “Reflect”, or as Gura declared, her [mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=8434).\n<Br>\n\n\nAnd with the dungeon cleared, the truth was revealed. \n<br>\n\n[Gawr Gura, ~~Thief~~ Princess of Atlantis](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?t=8698)\n<br>\n\nGura wasn’t just any adventurer; she was The Gawr Gura, a shark girl who once called this underwater kingdom home. Bored with her life beneath the waves, she had fled to start anew on land. \n<br>\n\nYet, her story of rebellion didn’t inspire admiration as [she had hoped](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=8786). Darwin, expecting royal lineage, was disillusioned to learn Gura was a commoner. Cecilia, anticipating a tragic tale, was taken aback to discover Gura’s departure had plunged the kingdom into chaos after she took away its primary defense, the trident. \n<br>\n\nTheir adventure continued at the tavern, where they celebrated with Gura’s newly acquired [music disc](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=9204), and the day once again closed of with some good ol' bits [gambling](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=9761).\n<br>\n\n[\"1 coin bet\" by kshut](#out:https://x.com/shutowl/status/1830517595768000529)\n<br>\n\n[\"the council will decide your fate\" by Miku](#out:https://x.com/Mikururun/status/1830701638472081531)\n\n\n",

From the moment he arrived, Gonathon had sworn unwavering loyalty to his Queen, Tam Gandr. His sole purpose as a knight was to serve her, with no distractions to deter him from his path. Naturally, he never imagined he would feel the touch of another's love.\n<br>\n\n\nAfter assisting the other heroes, including Jyonathan, in their perilous journey to the Underworld Dungeon, Gonathon gifted the blonde maiden 10 diamonds as a gesture of gratitude and empathy. To his surprise, Jyonathan responded with a playful question: \"Does this mean we’re married, then?\" Though initially taken aback, the idea of having a close companion by his side was appealing. Hesitant but intrigued, Gonathon agreed.\n\n<br>\n\n[Gonathon with the impeccable rizz](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?t=2046)\n<br>\n\nTheir union didn’t happen immediately, however. Bijou, in her usual mischief, momentarily derailed the situation. But eventually, Gonathon and Jyonathan became the first married couple of the day. Jyonathan affectionately told Gonathon he could call her his “Pearl,” a term of endearment that left the knight elated.\n<br>\n\n\nHaving a wife for the first time in his life awakened a deeply protective instinct in Gonathon. Throughout the day, he found himself frequently stressed over his beloved’s well-being, particularly whenever someone dared to hit on her. And more often than not, the culprit was the Hot Pink One.\n<br>\n\n\nWhether it was overhearing the Hot Pink One [hitting on](https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared&t=3460) his wife, whispering sweet nothings into her ear, or engaging in outright questionable behavior at the casino, Gonathon was always quick to intervene. His dedication even led him to abandon his own tasks, confront situations he normally would have avoided—like entering the Amber Coin Guild's domain—and defy his personal code, all in the name of protecting his Pearl.\n<br>\n\n[HANDS OF MY WIFE!!!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?t=3980)\n<br>\n\nHis loyalty extended beyond mere physical [protection](https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared&t=6395). Gonathon even went as far as rejecting the Queen’s orders when they conflicted with Jyonathan’s desires. During preparations for the Ocean Temple Dungeon, when he was told he would have to separate from his wife, Gonathon objected [furiously](https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared&t=10437). Tears streaming down his face, he begged to stay by her side. Despite the others’ insistence, he whispered a heartfelt plea for her to stay safe before they parted.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nGonathon's love for Jyonathan was undeniable. She had become his second guiding light, a purpose as important as his Queen. He respected her wishes, catered to her requests, and vowed to remain loyal to their bond until the very end.\n<br>\n\nAs for Jyonathan, the depth of her feelings for Gonathon was up for debate. Though she accepted his devotion, her occasional teasing remarks—like suggesting he might be an overbearing husband—hinted that perhaps her affection wasn’t as intense as his (see [Hot Pink One-Jyonathan: Plan B](#edge:ame-hot-pink-one-left-2-bottom-2)). Or maybe she simply enjoyed watching her knight squirm.\n<br>\n\n[He lets me speak sometimes](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared&t=9740)\n<br>\n\n[\"is this what they call...enemies to lovers?...\" by Mooon](#out:https://x.com/Moon_LDL/status/1830455614625001879)\n<br>\n\n[\"A proposal\" by Hyoweii](#out:https://x.com/weiiyxn/status/1830844192723255551)",

She insulted Elizabeth outright, refusing to address the knight by name and instead calling her things like \"red thing\" or \"harlot\" for supposedly harassing her guildmate—the infamous Hot Pink One—the day prior.\n<br>\n\n[Ah, so you are the Tim!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=7039)\n<br>\n\nElizabeth, however, was unfazed. She wanted to set matters straight and challenged Tam to a duel. But Tam, unwilling to get her own hands dirty, declined and instead called upon her subordinate, the Hot Pink One, to fight in her place. Confident in her superior weaponry and skill, Elizabeth saw this as an easy victory. After all, her opponent’s \"special ability\" was just… farting. How hard could it possibly be?\n<br>\n\n[Hot Red vs Hot Pink](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?t=7494)\n<br>\n\nAnd yet, to her absolute horror—Elizabeth lost.\n<br>\n\nBlaming the defeat on the \"ping ghost\" (a completely valid excuse in her eyes), she tried to save face, but the humiliation was [unavoidable](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=7553). Tam wasted no time rubbing salt in the wound, taunting Elizabeth and further souring the knight’s already bitter opinion of the so-called Queen.\n<br>\n\nBut that wasn’t the end of it.\n<br>\n\nLater that day, the two clashed again, and—unsurprisingly—Tam was the instigator once more. What started as a verbal spar quickly escalated when the topic of Shakira was brought into the fray.\n<br>\n\n[You are a mighty phoenix!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=7788)\n<br>\n\nElizabeth was appalled at what she saw—Shakira, kneeling before Tam, acting as nothing more than a servant to this self-proclaimed Queen. To Elizabeth, it was disgraceful. She had always seen Shakira as a mighty phoenix, a force to be reckoned with—not someone who should be groveling before this foul-mouthed, ill-mannered woman, spewing toxic waste for words.\n<br>\n\nElizabeth saw nothing in Tam that resembled royalty—no honor, no chivalry, no sense of grace. In her eyes, this woman was not worthy of being a Queen. And as much as she wanted to never deal with Tam again, she hoped others would eventually see the light as well.\n<br>\n\n[\"Libestal's forbidden love\" by yuuto](#out:https://x.com/yuutomeh97/status/1830490741384356254)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Raora mockingly pointed out that Tam was a queen without a castle—a jab made even sharper by the fact that Raora herself was in the process of building one. But Tam, visibly unbothered, walked away mid-conversation, leaving Raora to shout after her, calling her a \"koward\" (coward).\n<br>\n\nLater, in what seemed like a change of heart, Raora pulled Tam aside for a more formal discussion. \n<br>\n\n[My secret plans](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qDhyA4-79ko?feature=shared&t=10315)\n<br>\n\nShe proposed an alliance of sorts, suggesting that the two of them could both be queens—neither true nor fake—and rule the kingdom together. While Tam found the idea amusing, she still believed herself to be the worthier queen of the two. Their conversation was cut short when an eavesdropper interrupted, but Raora assured Tam that they’d continue the discussion later (they didn't).",

While the Hot Pink One kept whispering wishes under her breath for the bond between Gonathon and Jyonathan to falter, she couldn’t help but yearn for someone to call her own.\n<br>\n\n\nMiraculously, that wish would come true later in the day. \n<br>\n\n\nInside the Ocean Temple Dungeon, the Hot Pink One surprised everyone with her sudden knack for solving puzzles. It was an unexpected display of brilliance for someone usually lost in her chaotic antics. She credited her newfound intelligence and luck entirely to Ina’s hat, which she now considered a talisman of inspiration. Emboldened by this revelation, the pink lady realized her growing feelings for Nino Ina and—without hesitation—proposed.\n<br>\n\n[Will you be my eternal consort?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?t=9715)\n<br>\n\n\nHuzzah! Ina accepted, declaring herself the Hot Pink One’s “eternal consort.” The pair spent the rest of the day enjoying each other’s company, though it didn’t take long for cracks of skepticism to appear.

The Hot Pink One had often joked that Jyonathan could be her “backup plan” should the marriage falter. While she swore these were harmless jokes, the line between jest and truth had always been blurry with her. Surely, the pink lady wouldn’t stoop so low as to pursue her guildmate’s beloved…right?",

Nerissa served as a steady emotional anchor while Shiori, struggling with the complex puzzles, teetered on the brink of losing her sanity. Their banter flowed effortlessly, almost as though they had known each other for years. Beneath their eccentric exchanges, it was clear they genuinely cared for one another, showcasing a bond that stood out amidst the chaos of the kingdom.\n\n\n",

A pang of betrayal struck her chest. The Amber Coin guild was already dwindling, especially after Peasant Da Bae’s disappearance, and now it seemed on the verge of losing yet another member. If Darwin had truly defected, that would leave only her and her ever-reliable pink cat. The thought weighed heavily on her heart.\n<br>\n\nLater, however, Darwin approached Shakira in private. In a hushed tone, she revealed the truth—her apparent defection was all part of a larger plan. She had infiltrated the Scarlet Wand as a spy to gather information, and the red hat was merely a disguise. She even went as far as faking a reaction to gain pity from others.\n<br>\n\n[It's all part of a plan](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WQRPyJ4zhC0?feature=shared&t=4747)\n<br>\n\nHearing this, Shakira sighed in relief and decided to let Darwin in on her own secret. As it turned out, she was also playing the role of a double agent, trying to gain the trust of the Cerulean Cup members in order to erase the bad reputation that Amber Coin had mysteriously garnered.\n<br>\n\nSo, when looking at the bigger picture, it turned out that everyone had abandoned their guild for a mission of their own… meaning the only one truly left behind in Amber Coin was Raora.",

      "dayRecap": "## Day 3: Getting To Building\n\nIf marriages weren’t enough to tangle the kingdom’s relationship chart into a convoluted web, adoption has now entered the mix. \n<br>\n\nDay three proved to be an eventful one for Bijou—first, she was adopted by Elizabath as her daughter, adding yet another layer to her ever-complicated existence. As if that weren’t enough, she also caught her wife in the midst of an affair with another woman, leading to a whirlwind of confusion, confrontation, and attempts at resolution. And amidst all this chaos, Bijou remained steadfast in her pursuit of something truly important: a hat.\n<br>\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing rivalry between the self-proclaimed queens, Tam Gandr and Raora, continued to escalate—though at this point, it seemed to be more about Raora getting under Tam’s skin for her own amusement. This was also Tam's last day in the kingdom. \n<br>\n\nOn a broader scale, the kingdom saw a shift as more heroes set aside their usual adventuring to focus on something more permanent—building. With foundations being laid and walls rising, new homes and businesses began to take shape. Among them, Shiori constructed a quaint pink abode to call her own, Raora erected a grand castle fitting for her self-proclaimed queenly status, Tam established a guild base for her guildmates, and Bijou with her rocky masterpiece. \n<br>\n\n[Bijou's lucky Moai statue](#image:images-opt/moai.webp)\n<br>\n\nPerhaps the most notable addition, however, was the grand opening of Mori’s Tavern, fittingly named *Death Do Us Part*. Beyond serving food and drinks to weary travelers, this establishment came with a unique selling point—*divorce services*. With relationships forming (and hopefully crumbling) at an alarming rate, Mori saw an opportunity and seized it, offering an easy way out for those entangled in the kingdom’s ever-expanding web of bonds.\n\n<br>\n\nFinally, returning to the main task of the day—the dungeon challenge. This time, our adventurers were sent into the ominous depths of the [*Eldritch Horror Dungeon*](#out:https://x.com/hololive_En/status/1830787800968638636), a place shrouded in eerie whispers and creeping dread. The challenge? To complete a series of designated tasks within a reasonable timeframe before their sanity levels plummeted beyond salvation. Upon completetion, the heroes were granted the recovered memories of [*Ninomae Ina’nis*](#out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE5Ow4L1Zt8).\n<br>\n\n[Inside the Eldritch Horror Dungeon](#image:images-opt/ina-dungeon.webp)\n",

She congratulated Mococo and handed over her prize money. Mococo had won a total of *710 coins*, which seemed like a lot... until you considered that she had spent 680 coins the day before buying all the tickets. In the end, she made a grand profit of *30 coins*—not much, but what mattered to her was the thrill of winning. \n<br>\n\nNaturally, being the responsible adult she was, she decided to reinvest all her money back into the lottery.

While they congratulated her, their concern grew upon learning that she had spent all her money on lottery tickets [again](https://www.youtube.com/live/zh0satM3cEs?feature=shared&t=1395).\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Mococo joined Raora, Fuwawa, Elizabeth, and Calli to tackle the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*.

Despite her fears, the group succeeded in their mission and recovered the [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/zh0satM3cEs?feature=shared&t=3965) of *Ninomae Ina'nis*. \n",

Upon joining the kingdom, Elizabeth reflected on her journey thus far. \n<br>\n\nThrown into this journey, devoid of memories, she had made new comrades and formed new connections. Over the first two days, she had managed to recover the memories of Mori Calliope and Gawr Gura. Yet, she couldn’t help but wonder: when would she regain her own memories? She felt as though a part of her was missing—something near and dear, or perhaps, someone. \n<br>\n\n[3am thoughts](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/oVguNTPnDww?feature=shared&t=612)\n<br>\n\nThis inner thought lingered for a moment, but Elizabeth quickly shook it off, pumping herself up for the fourth day of her adventure.\n<br>\n\n\nElizabeth made her way to the quest board to take on more tasks. There, she was greeted by Nerissa, and to her dismay, she became a complete mess in front of the raven-haired lady. Elizabeth had been feeling \"weird\" whenever she was around Nerissa, but she couldn’t quite figure out what the feeling was (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Beautiful Maiden](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-3-left-2)).\n<br>\n\nMoving on, Elizabeth wandered around and met Cecilia and Bijou, who were engrossed in a conversation about various, yet questionable, topics. Liz was left dumbfounded throughout the exchange. To her surprise, Bijou suddenly asked Liz to be her mother. Though confused, Liz accepted. Her bewilderment only deepened when she learned that her newly adopted daughter was already married (see [Elizabeth-Bijou: Impromptu Adoption](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-koseki-bijou-bottom-3-top-1))\n<br>\n\nAs many friends as Elizabeth made, she also had her skepticism toward a few—specifically, those she suspected of being witches. And at the top of that list? The mastermind behind the latest lottery craze, Ceres Fauna. Something about this green lady just didn’t sit right with Elizabeth, and she wasn’t about to let her guard down (see [Elizabeth-Fauna: She's a Witch](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-ceres-fauna-bottom-2-top-2)).\n<br>\n\nLater in the day, she was invited by Raora to tackle the dungeon of the day: the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*. Joining them were Calli and the two doggos. During the conquest, while trying to help Mococo, who accidentally found herself stuck in a ditch, Elizabeth clumsily fell and shared the same situation as the fuzzy one. \n<br>\n\n[Taking the promise too literally](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/oVguNTPnDww?feature=shared&t=9220)\n<br>\n\nNonetheless, they managed to free themselves.

Teasing him relentlessly, she manipulated him into kneeling, gaslighting him into believing it was for some grand purpose.

Painted in shades of green to match her guild, the building was accented with white quartz for a bright and inviting diner-like vibe. The establishment had two floors. The first floor housed the main dining area. Upon entering, customers were greeted by a wall-mounted menu that listed a variety of dishes, including the prized *\"Ultimate Fruit Milkshake\"*. \n<br>\n\nNext to the menu was the divorce board, where all divorces—offered free with a meal—would be recorded on a sign and displayed. The corner of the room held the kitchen, bustling with activity. Upstairs, the second floor was a \"special room\" designed for adventuring pairs or couples to rent for private moments.

She encountered Gonathon and collected his daily dowry of [500 coins](https://www.youtube.com/live/efqkfe_5O0s?feature=shared&t=2608), then crossed paths with Cecilia, who was desperate to obtain a Scarlet Wand hat. The green maiden saw Calli donning the coveted hat, and so they struck a deal: Cecilia would buy food from the tavern, and play Calli a speical song in exchange for the hat. \n<br>\n\nHowever, Cecilia was flat broke and had made the promise out of desperation. Calli, pitying her, decided to gift her the hat anyway, marking her first unofficial customer.\n<br>\n\n[Giving handouts](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/efqkfe_5O0s?t=2917)\n<br>\n\nLater, Fuwawa expressed interest in visiting the diner. Calli enthusiastically showed her around and tried to sell her the Ultimate Fruit Milkshake, but, like Cecilia, Fuwawa had [no money](https://www.youtube.com/live/efqkfe_5O0s?feature=shared&t=3995). Disheartened, Calli had no choice but to kick her out. It seemed the kingdom’s citizens were not as financially stable as she had hoped.\n<br>\n\n\nDespite the setbacks, Calli prepared for the main event of the day: tackling the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*. Her new kitchen allowed her to cook meals for herself and her teammates. Joining her on the quest were Fuwawa, Mococo, Raora, and Elizabeth. Together, they successfully conquered the dungeon and recovered the memories of [Ninomae Ina’nis](https://www.youtube.com/live/efqkfe_5O0s?feature=shared&t=7707).  \n<br>\n\n\nOn her way back to the tavern, Calli ran into Tam Gandr. Calli eagerly invited her to dine at the tavern, and to her delight, Tam agreed, bringing along Gonathon, Bijou, and Shiori as additional customers. Calli was ecstatic—this was her chance to finally make some profit! Tam, as the self-proclaimed queen, surely had plenty of wealth to cover the meals. \n<br>\n\nEveryone placed their orders, and Tam volunteered (or was forced) to pay. However, after Calli prepared and served the food, she discovered that Tam was even more broke than her previous customers. Reluctantly, and not wanting to embarrass the queen in front of her followers, Calli gave the food in what she considered an unfair trade. \n<br>\n\n[Why are y'all broke](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/efqkfe_5O0s?feature=shared&t=10791)\n<br>\n\n\nBy the end of the day, Calli realized her business had made zero profit—worse, she had gone into the negatives. Nevertheless, she remained optimistic. While the food might not have been the highlight of her tavern, the divorces surely would be, and she was confident her unique service would gain traction soon enough.\n",

            "content": "FaunaMart was already under fire—despite being open for just one day, rumors swirled accusing the business of being a scam. Fauna couldn’t pinpoint the origin of these claims, but one thing was clear: she needed to save her company’s reputation. Thus, the green *CEO* devised a bold PR campaign to turn things around.\n<br>\n\n[We're a reputable business](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc&t=178s)\n<br>\n\n\nHer plan was straightforward yet effective: she would boost the jackpot prize with her own funds, start selling hats and other sought-after items, and recruit her Scarlet Wand guildmates to help manage sales in her absence. Fauna assured everyone that her lottery wasn’t gambling—because, according to her, it didn’t count, or if it did, it was the only form of that should be [endorsed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc&t=571s).\n\n<br>\n\n\nFauna’s first order of business was to gather materials. Along the way, she quickly conquered the *Ocean Temple* [dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/menSag1VKTc?feature=shared&t=5846), which she hadn’t had the chance to tackle the previous day. With plenty of resources in hand, Fauna returned to her shop, setting prices just exorbitant enough to not discourage sales and still make her plenty of profit.\n<br>\n\n\nLater, it was time to announce the day’s lottery winner. The winning number was 734, and much to Fauna’s shock, Mococo won the jackpot of 707 coins—unsurprising, given the doggo had purchased 68 tickets.\n\n<br>\n\n[The first lottery drawing](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/menSag1VKTc?t=7156)\n<br>\n\nThe rumors about FaunaMart’s legitimacy persisted, however. Gonathon confronted Fauna, asking if her business was indeed a [scam](https://www.youtube.com/live/menSag1VKTc?feature=shared&t=9225). With her smooth-talking charm, Fauna reassured him of her noble intentions to serve the community. Whether genuine or not, her words [worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc&t=9680s). Gonathon bought 130 tickets—30 of which were for Nerissa. The customers kept rolling in, with Bijou purchasing 10 tickets and even her former accuser, Raora, begrudgingly buying one as well.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs business boomed, Nerissa approached Fauna to share an alarming discovery: a \"glitch\" that allowed infinite money generation. While Nerissa’s intentions were pure, Fauna saw the devastating impact this could have on her business. Without hesitation, she reported it to the Gods, who patched it immediately.\n\n<br>\n\n[I must protect the economy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/menSag1VKTc?t=12540)\n<br>\n\nTrue to her expansion goals, Fauna focused on selling high-demand goods. When she found Bijou struggling to acquire Stain Bones for a quest, Fauna seized the opportunity to [advertise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc&t=13038s) her wares. Relentlessly, she pitched her products until the rock maiden caved and made a [purchase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc&t=14030s).\n<br>\n\n\nDespite her entrepreneurial ambitions, Fauna still had duties to fulfill. She joined Nerissa and Cecilia to take on the *Eldritch Horror dungeon*. Together, they triumphed, recovering fragments of *Ninomae Ina'nis’* [memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc&t=17971s).\n\n<br>\n\n\nReturning to her store, Fauna was greeted by Mococo, who came to collect her lottery winnings—only to spend it all immediately on 71 more [tickets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc&t=14536s). Business was booming like never before. From lottery sales to rare goods and even her healing services, the capitalist queen in green had solidified her path to wealth.\n<br>\n| Name      | Tickets Bought | Coins Spent |\n|-----------|---------------|-------------|\n| Gonathon  | 160           | 1600        |\n| Nerissa   | 30            | 300         |\n| Bijou     | 10            | 100         |\n| Raora     | 1             | 10          |\n| Calli     | 1             | 10          |\n| Mococo    | 71            | 710         |\n| Cecilia   | 3             | 30          |\n\n<br>\n\nGave away 54 for free, total coins earned: *2220*",

Nerissa invited Shiori to assist her with the second dungeon, a task Nerissa had been unable to complete previously. Shiori declined the invitation outright, leaving Nerissa disappointed. To twist the knife, Shiori made a snarky comment about Nerissa’s hat before sending her on her way.\n<br>\n\n[Take your benis hat elsewhere](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/BnpLALzUzD4?feature=shared&t=427)\n<br>\n\n\nThe refusals didn’t end there.

She couldn’t say for sure. \n<br>\n\nTo make things stranger, she discovered a piece of paper tucked inside her shoe. Written in elegant green cursive were the words: \"find it...!\" How did it get there? Who wrote it? And what did it mean? Confused but intrigued, Cecilia resolved to uncover the mystery.  \n<br>\n\n[A message in her shoe](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?t=370)\n<br>\n\nHowever, before she could dive into this enigma, the usual chaos of her daily adventures unfolded.\n<br>\n\n\nAt the start of the day, she ran into Bijou. The two shared their Revelations and somehow ended up having a bizarre conversation about detaching and reattaching Cecilia’s [limbs](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=1764). Cecilia, casually claiming she was an automaton—a living doll—assured Bijou it was perfectly normal. The encounter didn’t stop there. Cecilia found herself unofficially officiating Bijou’s adoption as Elizabeth’s daughter, claiming she was a certified [contractor](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=1910).\n<br>\n\n\nLater, at the quest board, Cecilia encountered Calli wearing the Scarlet Wand hat she had been coveting for days. Overcome with desire, she begged to trade for it. They struck a deal: Cecilia could have the hat if she purchased food from Calli’s tavern. But being broke, Cecilia had to scrounge together whatever useless trinkets she had to barter with. Somehow, it [worked](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=3020). \n<br>\n\nAlong with the trade, Cecilia sang a song as part of her \"payment,\" earning the hat she’d been dreaming of. Elated, she paraded it around to show off her prize to anyone willing to look.\n<br>\n\n[Check out my hat!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/-QKg8Fau9GM?si=7nMEbH-xj6IwR06k&amp;start=3350)\n<br>\n\n\nContinuing her day, Cecilia bumped into Gonathon. Their conversation spiraled into her spouting wild conspiracy theories about the kingdom and its citizens. Gonathon listened with a mix of confusion and disbelief, silently wondering if she was entirely sane.\n<br>\n\n[What is she yapping about](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=3869)\n<br>\n\nAmused or perhaps out of pity, he offered her 500 coins and declared her an honorary member of the Cerulean Cup.\n<br>\n\n\nDuring one of her quests, Cecilia found herself caught in the middle of a scandal. She had run into Shiori, only to discover she was embroiled in a marriage drama with Bijou. Cecilia couldn’t resist watching the chaos unfold, as Bijou caught Shiori red-handed in a compromising situation. Cecilia was left [marveling](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=5886) at the drama, entertained by the tension between the wedded pair.\n<br>\n\nEventually, it was time for Cecilia to face the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*. Joining her on this journey were Nerissa and Fauna. Together, they navigated the dungeon’s dark corridors, defeating its challenges and recovering fragments of Ninomae Ina'nis’ [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=7361).\n<br>\n\n\nAs with her previous days, Cecilia chose to wind down with some gambling. The day’s events had completely distracted her from the mysterious note she found that morning. But as she started to lose money again—her usual outcome—something strange happened. Red, ominous text flashed in her mind, reading:\n\"Come find me.\"\n\"You mustn’t forget.\"\n\n<br>\n\n[Cryptic messages](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?t=8195)\n<br>\n\nAt first, Cecilia brushed it off, too engrossed in her gambling to give it much thought. But after emptying her pockets once again, the urgency of the messages finally sunk in. She began asking others if they had experienced anything similar. With the strange paper in the morning and now these eerie messages, it was clear something—or someone—was calling to her.\n<br>\n\nBefore she could investigate further, the key on her head abruptly stopped spinning. Her vision darkened, and the world around her faded into black.\n<br>\n\n[\"She got tha HAT!!!\" by aWoooFa](#out:https://x.com/Awooofa/status/1831049705700413843)",

Unlike Fauna, who needed money to fuel her thriving business, or Gonathon, who used it to help others, Nerissa's goal was simple—she just liked being rich.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHer day began with a brief chat with Fauna, during which Nerissa declared her mission to amass as much money as [possible](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared&t=313). Wasting no time, she dived into quests to build her fortune. It was during these quests that she stumbled upon a game-changing revelation: a \"glitch\" in the kingdom's system that allowed her to infinitely exploit a particular quest for its rewards.\n\n<br>\n\n[A glitch in the system](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?t=5125)\n<br>\n\n\nFor over thirty minutes, Nerissa abused this loophole, amassing thousands of coins in record time. The sheer speed and scale of her earnings left her feeling invincible. She shared her discovery only with those she trusted—namely, Bijou and Fauna—and explicitly warned the voices in her head to keep the glitch [a secret](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared&t=5386). \n\n<br>\n\nUnfortunately for Nerissa, the voices [betrayed](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared&t=7603) her. Word of the glitch spread quickly, prompting the kingdom’s gods to patch it. But not before Nerissa secured over 5,000 coins, cementing her status as one of the kingdom’s wealthiest individuals.\n<br>\n\n\nThe rest of her day was less financially groundbreaking but still eventful. After [failing](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared&t=7986) to recruit Shiori to accompany her to the second dungeon and inadvertently stirring up relationship [drama](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared&t=9661) between Shiori and Bijou (see [Bijou-Shiori: Soap Opera](#edge:shiori-nyavella-koseki-bijou-right-2-left-2)), Nerissa joined Fauna and Cecilia for the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*.

But unlike Gonathon, who was making money to pay his dowry, help the community and his queen, or Nerissa who was supporting her guildmate with their business, Bijou's goal for riches was much grander. It was for... *a hat*. \n<br>\n\nShe had been yearning for one ever since she stepped foot in this kingdom. Every day up until now, she had lived in shame, watching others with their long red hats, blue square hats, and green L-shaped hats, while she possessed no hat of her own. This was going to change today. But, of course, like always, there were plenty of shenanigans along the way.\n<br>\n\n[Bijou resenting Nerissa for her hat](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?t=141)\n<br>\n\nAt the start of her day, Bijou decided to check out FaunaMart. She was surprised to learn that, despite hearing rumors about the business being a scam, someone had actually won the lottery—and it was Mococo, no less. Hearing about the massive prize pool, Bijou wasted no time buying some tickets of [her own](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared&t=616). \n<br>\n\n\nKnowing that Bijou needed *Stain Bones* for her quest, Fauna advertised that she was selling them—though at very high prices. Bijou declined, confident she could get them herself. \n<br>\n\nHowever, while struggling to slay the Stains for the bones, Bijou received an [ad call](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared&t=2340) from Fauna, reminding her that she could purchase the bones at her store instead. She continued struggling and received yet another [ad call](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared&t=2565). Eventually, having great difficulty acquiring the bones on her own, she yielded and returned to FaunaMart to [buy them](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared&t=3325).\n<br>\n\nContinuing her day, Bijou noticed that her wife, Shiori, was awake and went to greet her. However, during their conversation, she couldn’t help but notice Shiori referring to her as *\"my other wife\"*, hinting at a relationship with another woman (see [Bijou-Shiori: Soap Opera](#edge:shiori-nyavella-koseki-bijou-right-2-left-2)).\n<br>\n\n\nAfter this, they turned their attention to one of the primary tasks for the day: tackling the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*. Joining Bijou were Shiori, Tam, and Gonathon. Together, they conquered the dungeon and recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared&t=12019) of *Ninomae Ina'nis*.\n<br>\n\n\nWith all the \"unimportant stuff\" out of the way, it was finally time for Bijou to focus on her ultimate goal: getting her much coveted a hat. \n<br>\n\nDesperate for this hat, she spent every last coin trying to obtain it. She completed quests to earn money, but failed to get a hat. She gambled for more money, but failed to get a hat. She asked others for money but still failed. Even when she found an exploit to earn a ridiculous amount of money, it didn’t work out. As others were getting hats left and right, Bijou could only hold in her jealousy for so long.\n<br>\n\n[Bijou malds at others' hats](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?t=9316)\n<br>\n\nFailure after failure, Bijou was starting to lose hope. Perhaps it wasn’t meant to be, for her to don a hat of her own. \n<br>\n\nBut just when despair was setting in, it finally happened. After many, many gacha pulls, she finally got a hat. And it wasn’t just any hat—it was a hat in the shape of a Stain, which she thought was very cool. It only took her *forty-two* tries and cost her *12,600 coins*. Not exactly the most efficient way to spend money, but it was worth it nonetheless.\n<br>\n\n[Bijou finally obtains a hat, a *Stain Hat*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?t=22515)\n<br>\n\nBijou could now go to sleep happily, donning the hat she had yearned for so long.

            "content": "Gonathon's third day's objective was simple: make lots of money. The reason was twofold: first, he needed to pay Calli 500 coins a day as promised on day two, when Calli demanded a daily dowry for Gonathon to maintain his marriage to Jyon Watson. Second, he wanted to purchase as much building material as possible for his queen, Tam Gandr, to assist her in constructing the Cerulean Cup guild base. \n<br>\n\nThough his goal was as clear as day, the journey was anything but smooth.\n<br>\nAt the very start of his day, Gonathon found himself ambushed—not by monsters, but by Raora. The mischievous big pink cat wasted no time [teasing](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared&t=1395) him relentlessly. Knowing that Gonathon's unwavering loyalty was to Tam, Raora used her charms and beauty to exploit his one weakness. \n<br>\n\nYet, her antics didn’t stop there. Throughout the day, she seemed to [stalk](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared&t=2160) him, appearing around every corner, much to Gonathon's growing frustration. To vent it out, she hit Elizabeth with his horse.\n<br>\n\n[That one was personal](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?t=1799)\n<br>\n\n\nDespite being distracted by the ever-persistent Raora, Gonathon stayed focused on his objective. He worked diligently and effectively, earning more money than he had anticipated. Being the humble and loyal knight that he was, he didn’t hoard his wealth but instead used it to help others. \n<br>\n\nWhen his guildmate Bijou ran out of money after spending everything trying to obtain a hat, Gonathon gave her a portion of his [earnings](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared&t=1567). He also offered Cecilia some coin—not to aid her in any noble endeavor, but simply to stop her from incessantly pestering him about her latest conspiracy theory involving the [king](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared&t=2891). Even FaunaMart benefited from his [generosity](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared&t=3346), as he donated a substantial amount toward their library-building project, though it wasn't entirely sure the library was a legitimate venture.\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Gonathon was invited by Calli to visit her newly opened *diner*, which boasted a unique menu of diverse meals paired with free divorce services. Coincidentally, he crossed paths with his queen, Tam, at the diner. Eager to report his progress, Gonathon proudly told her about all the building materials he had been gathering for her. Tam, surprised and overjoyed, rewarded everyone by treating them to a meal using her [“eight thousand coins”](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared&t=9637) that she claimed to possess. Nevertheless, the gesture was appreciated by all.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAfter a fulfilling meal, Gonathon moved on to the next major task of the day: conquering the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*. His party included Tam, Shiori, and Bijou. While his bravery and energy were well-known in the kingdom, his fear of horror was a closely guarded secret. \n<br>\nHowever, in the dark and eerie depths of the dungeon, that fear was laid bare. He flinched at sudden noises, froze when left alone in the dark, and struggled to keep his composure throughout the journey. It was a stark contrast to his usual persona, but despite his trepidation, Gonathon pressed on.\n<br>\n\n[Bro screamed at nothing](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared&t=10587)\n<br>\n\nThrough teamwork and perseverance, the group emerged victorious, recovering the [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared&t=10803) of *Ninomae Ina’nis*. With their mission complete, Gonathon returned to the kingdom to assist Tam in building the guild base. He poured the remainder of his energy into the task, dedicating himself entirely to helping her realize her vision (see [Gonathon-Tam: Knight and Queen](#edge:gonathon-g-tam-gandr-bottom-2-left-2)).\n<br>\n\n[\"gonathon g / pure of heart\" by scramble ham](#out:https://x.com/scrambleham/status/1831057372820963655)\n<br>\n\n[\"Gonathon G\" by Hyoweii](#out:https://x.com/weiiyxn/status/1831340977870823504)",

            "title": "Tam Gandr",
            "content": "The third day dawned for Tam, the blue, self-proclaimed Queen of Libestal. Upon entering the kingdom, she was greeted by Calli, who eagerly announced the opening of her new diner and invited Tam to buy a meal. Tam was soon joined by her Gonathon, Bijou, and Shiori, the latter being Bijou’s wife. \n<br>\n\nDespite the diner's variety of offerings, Tam was a picky eater, and made an elaborate request: a meal free of sodium, dairy, gluten, and fruit. She made all those requirements as she was looking at an item literally called the *Ultimate Fruit Milkshake*. \n<br>\n\n[You can't eat much, huh](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/JcRcTRedS_8?feature=shared&t=857)\n<br>\n\nShe then asked for something evocative of loneliness, and Calli recommended the Breakfast Toast, modestly priced at 50 coins. Tam, however, had only *58 coins*—an amount far too modest for a queen to admit. When questioned about her wealth, with dramatic flair, she claimed she had a fortune of *[8,000 coins](https://www.youtube.com/live/JcRcTRedS_8?feature=shared&t=945)*, gifted by the King himself.  \n<br>\n\nThe others believed her without question, impressed by her apparent riches. With that much wealth, Shiori suggested Tam buy everyone food to prove her generosity. The Queen reluctantly agreed and discreetly bargained with the diner owner for alternative payment methods.\n<br>\n\n[The call me the negotiator](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/JcRcTRedS_8?si=cZLEVV6TMpfpT6pL&amp;start=1631)\n<br>\n\n\nThrough wit and sheer determination, Tam managed to treat the group, concealing her near-emptied coin purse. With their meal concluded, they turned their focus to the day’s main quest: the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*. Tam’s team, consisting of Bijou, Gonathon, and Shiori, together, triumphed and recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/JcRcTRedS_8?feature=shared&t=2670) of *Ninomae Ina’nis*. \n\n<br>\n\n\nWith the conquest completed, Tam returned to her construction of the Cerulean Cup guild base, a project she approached with dedication. Yet peace eluded her. The exaggerated tales of her supposed wealth spiraled out of control—what began as a boast of 8,000 coins became 8 million, then 8 billion, and ultimately 800 trillion. Her guildmates teased her endlessly, and Tam couldn’t help but regret the single lie that had snowballed into such absurdity.\n<br>\n\n[Why did I lie...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/JcRcTRedS_8?feature=shared&t=4242)\n<br>\n\nHer work was interrupted further by Raora, the pink cat, whose mere presence sparked the usual verbal sparring. Tam, upon learning that Raora was from Amber Coin—a guild she despised—called for Bijou and Gonathon to help her eject Raora, dramatically claiming she was “being harmed” (see [Raora-Tam: Queens Standoff](#edge:raora-panthera-tam-gandr-right-2-top-1)). \n\n<br>\n\n\nAfterwards, as the day waned, Tam finally found her bits of peace. After all, true to her nature, she found comfort in solitude. Tam turned her attention to the guild base—a project she was determined to finish because this was her last day in the kingdom. She was to attend to urgent business in a [faraway land](https://www.youtube.com/live/JcRcTRedS_8?feature=shared&t=12460). \n<br>\n\nBut more important than the kingdom itself, this was her last day to spend with everyone—her guildmates. \n<br>\n\nAs much as they caused her head wrinkles, she still cared for their well-being. Her good will had been shown from time to time again, like how she defended Gonathon and the Hot Pink One when they were interrogated by Elizabeth on the first day, or when she reminded Bijou to spend less money on gambling and gacha. She even fought to buy food for everyone despite having little to her name. And now, she was constructing a home for them all—a roof under which they could gather and reside. \n<br>\n\nThe lady in blue was often cruel in her words, but deep inside, her heart was kind, empathetic, and full of care. The guild base was her way of showing this, a gift to the people she had grown to cherish (see [Gonathon-Tam: Safe Journey](#edge:gonathon-g-tam-gandr-bottom-2-left-2)).\n<br>\n\n\nAfter many hours of hard labor and frustration, the Cerulean Cup guild base was done. \n<br>\n\n[Tour of the guild hall](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/JcRcTRedS_8?si=BpLFAukBwLvo_GEc&amp;start=19012)\n<br>\n\nThe wooden structure stood as a testament to her dedication and creativity, adorned with cherry blossoms whose delicate petals danced in the breeze. The hallways were lit by the warm glow of torches, while sea lanterns illuminated the floors. Paintings decorated the walls, and each room was uniquely designed to reflect the guild members’ personalities: Bijou’s room featured her beloved pet rock, while Ina and The Hot Pink One had connected rooms to symbolize their bond. The second floor housed a spacious, cozy common area—a perfect gathering place for the friends she was leaving behind.\n<br>\n\n\nThis was more than just a building; it was a piece of her soul, left in a place that had become a home, however briefly. She hoped they would use it well, filling its halls with laughter and the kind of memories she now carried with her.  \n\n<br>\n\nAnd with that, Tam departed from Libestal, leaving behind a kingdom she had entered as a stranger but left as a cherished friend.\n",

The smile on the gem maiden’s face faded instantly, replaced by confusion and a pang of hurt. Bijou immediately pressed Shiori for answers—who was this \"other wife\"?\n<br>\n\nIt turned out to be Nerissa Ravencroft, someone Bijou wasn’t particularly fond of. Sure, there was the stark contrast between Bijou’s petite figure and Nerissa’s elegant hourglass form, but more importantly, Shiori was her wife, not Nerissa’s. Still, Bijou reassured herself: Nerissa hadn’t participated in the same quirky ceremony that she and Shiori had. That made their bond unique, special, and above all, official—right?\n<br>\n\nThe day started off smoothly despite the awkward morning. Bijou and Shiori went on their usual adventures, gathering materials, completing quests, and enjoying the idyllic life of a married couple. But their happiness was short-lived.\n<br>\n\nWhile wandering through the kingdom later that day, Bijou accidentally overheard a conversation between Shiori, Cecilia, and Nerissa. What she heard struck her to the core.\n<br>\n\n[She betrayed me!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?t=5811)\n\n\n<br>\n\nShiori had casually mentioned that she wasn’t sure if she and Bijou were truly married. The words stung—Bijou had thought their bond was unshakable, an unbreakable vow of love. But Shiori, being Shiori, had simply been speaking without a second thought, not realizing the weight of her words.\n<br>\n\n\n\nHeartbroken and conflicted, Bijou later confronted Shiori to clear up the [misunderstanding](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared&t=6015). A small crowd of bystanders and guildmates gathered, witnessing the tense but sincere discussion. Somehow, things worked themselves out—though exactly how, no one could really say. \n<br>\n\nThe situation grew even more chaotic when Gonathon arrived, acting as Nerissa’s unexpected messenger. \n<br>\n\n[What's even happening anymore](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?t=6281)\n<br>\n\n\nNerissa, he explained, was deeply saddened and jealous over the whole ordeal. She had even declared that she would “allow” Bijou to have Shiori for the night but also insisted that she was entitled to Shiori herself for their dungeon raid. Gonathon also added saying Nerissa had “permitted” him to have Shiori for the night too, and that Shiori would be okay with having mutilple wives, so technically she'd be okay with everyone going together, and-\n<br>\n\nThe tangled mess of relationships left everyone’s heads spinning. Was Shiori okay with having two wives? Three? Who even knew anymore? In the end, they all unanimously decided to blame Nerissa for the confusion, mostly for the heck of it.",

Koseki Bijou declared herself the *Princess of the Kingdom of Evergreen*, with Cecilia as her loyal knight and—somehow—Raora as her mother. This now meant she had two moms. As if the chaos of one kingdom wasn’t enough, they went ahead and invented another.\n<br>\n\nThe dungeon of the day was the [*Volcanic Dungeon*](#out:https://x.com/hololive_En/status/1831150187605049574), and this one was no joke. Easily the most brutal challenge so far, it pushed our heroes to their absolute limits. \n<br>\n\n[The Flame Guardian](#image:images-opt/volcanic.webp)\n<br>\n\nAs the name suggests, fire and burning were the dominant themes, and oh boy, did everyone get firsthand experience. There was screaming, there was falling, and the total death count easily reached three digits. By the time they were done, the adventurers were little more than walking piles of charcoal. Their reward for enduring this fiery ordeal? The recovered memories of [*Takanashi Kiara*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3bQdV_sl08).\n<br>\n\nNot all of the day's events were a fiery disaster—some new interactions took place as well. One of the more unexpected pairings was Gura and Gonathon, who had never met before but seemed to get along… well, probably. Gonathon'd also started the construction of a statue for Tam Gandr, as a commemoration for his beloved queen.\n<br>\n\nBut the true spectacle of the day wasn’t the dungeon, nor the new royal claims—it was the lottery fiasco between Mococo and Nerissa. What began as a simple mistake quickly spiraled into an all-out disaster. \n<br>\n\nOne small blunder left Nerissa spending the entire day running for her life from a rabid, fuzzy dog with dangerously sharp claws, while Mococo’s unchecked greed eventually backfired, forcing her to go into hiding from everyone.

FaunaMart had transformed her into a true devotee of business, and she was eager to spread her enthusiasm to everyone she met.\n\n<br>\n\n[Spreading the cult](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?si=ly9UeB1xnJxbiIvz&t=405)\n<br>\n\n\nNaturally, the first stop on her agenda was FaunaMart. Though she didn’t win that day’s ticket, the sight of the massive jackpot only fueled her determination. Mococo wasn’t one to be deterred by a single loss. Even without Fauna present, she found an opportunity to indulge her gambling craze when she discovered Nerissa, freshly appointed as a FaunaMart employee. \n<br>\n\nOf course, Mococo couldn’t resist buying lottery tickets from her. It was the same as always, a batch purchase of lottery tickets, nothing new, nothing special. So surely, nothing would go wrong… right? (see [Mococo-Nerissa: Lottery Fiasco](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-nerissa-ravencroft-right-2-right-1), a lot happened).\n<Br>\n\n\nDespite her money-driven fervor, Mococo still found time for adventuring. Later in the day, she tackled the *Volcanic Dungeon* alongside the Hot Pink One and Bijou, [screaming and scrambling](https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?feature=shared&t=6904) through the fiery challenges. Emerging victorious, the group recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?feature=shared&t=9307)) of *Takanashi Kiara*.\n",

From the very start of her journey, she had dedicated herself to that cause, striving to embody generosity and compassion. It was what her guild master and the King expected of her, and so she fulfilled that duty for their sake.\n<br>\nAnd yet, something felt incomplete.\n<br>\nDeep down, she couldn’t shake the feeling that doing good because it was expected of her made it feel...forced.\n<br>\n[Where my good will lies](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=239)\n<br>\n\nNonetheless, a new day was starting, with new adventures to come.\n<br>\n\nThe scarlet maiden awoke from a long nap and wasted no time diving into one of her trademark monologues. She was informed by her daughter about the mysterious \"winds\" conspiring against her, spreading tales about her supposed desire to \"wife\" Nerissa. Naturally, Elizabeth brought this up during her usual talking-to-herself session.\n<br>\n\n[Must be the wind](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=782)\n<br>\n\n\nIn the middle of her rambling, Raora called in. Elizabeth found herself quite fond of the pink cat, partly because she listened to her (sometimes outlandish) claims without judgment. Their bond deepened when Raora gifted Elizabeth the Jade Sword [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=1042)—a gesture that left Elizabeth deeply touched. So much so that when Raora took a tumble, Elizabeth responded with dramatic cries and sniffles.\n<br>\n\n[Kitty noooooo- oh she's okay](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=1397)\n<br>\n\nWith trust firmly established, Elizabeth accepted Raora’s invitation to tackle the *Volcanic Dungeon* alongside Nerissa. The trio emerged victorious, recovering memories of [Takanashi Kiara](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=5895). \n\n<br>\n\n\nUpon returning to the kingdom, Elizabeth discovered that her guild area could trap people within its bounds. Fueled by curiosity (and a penchant for theatrics), she attempted to trap [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=7186) in Calli’s tavern for interrogation. Later, she tried the same trick on Nerissa, this time to force her into listening to music. Both attempts failed, leaving Elizabeth bewildered and mildly frustrated.\n<br>\n\n\nThe day took a chaotic turn when Elizabeth became an impromptu guardian for Mococo, who was being pursued for allegedly placing a bounty on Nerissa’s head. \n<br>\n\n[What's wrong, fuzzy one?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=7939)\n<br>\n\nThe situation spiraled when Gonathon, seeking answers about Mococo, challenged Elizabeth to a duel. Determined not to repeat her past humiliation at the hands of the Hot Pink One, Elizabeth gave the duel her all. She emerged victorious, earning the respect of onlookers.  \n<br>\n\nHowever, her triumph was short-lived. As part of Gonathon’s terms for the duel, he forced Nerissa to utter a heart-wrenching phrase: “I hate you.”\n<br>\n\nElizabeth, the scarlet knight, was left heartbroken. The sweetness of her victory dissolved into bitterness (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Heartbroken](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-3-left-2)).\n",

Yet, something felt amiss. The fiery motivation that once drove her seemed to have flickered out. Perhaps it was the absence of someone who had sparked that fire in the first place. Regardless, she pressed on, determined to bring her vision to completion. \n<br>\n\n\nEarly in the day, Raora received a call from Gonathon, whose voice was feeling \"kind of funny\" and wanted to show Raora just for fun. Raora picked up, and [gaslit](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y0H168Iq8aY?feature=shared&t=3874) the knight into thinking his voice sounded perfectly normal. Raora then welcomed Bijou and Cecilia for a tour of her castle.

To make a quick profit, she joined the others in exploiting a peculiar trend: crafting an excessive amount of potato salad. With her coffers replenished, Raora teamed up with Elizabeth and Nerissa to conquer the *Volcanic Dungeon*.

Her strategy? Gamble again. Unfortunately, luck was not on her side, and after one swift loss, she promptly [walked away](https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?feature=shared&t=798) from the tables.\n\n<br>\n\n\nNot one to dwell on misfortune, Napoleaon set out to catch up on the kingdom’s latest developments. She stumbled upon Raora, now known as Queen Mario, and Bijou, who had declared herself Princess of the Kingdom of Evergreen. The pair now identified as mother and daughter, much to Napoleaon’s [bemusement](https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?feature=shared&t=912). \n\n<br>\n\n\nContinuing her exploration, she encountered Nerissa, who tempted her with a new item at FaunaMart: a stylish hat priced at 1,500 coins. Napoleaon declined—not due to her lack of funds (though she didn’t have enough) but because of her staunch distrust of FaunaMart. To her, the store represented all that was wrong with commerce: shady practices, monopolistic tendencies, and deceitful advertising.  \n\n<br>\n\n[No one needs your scam hat](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?t=1057)\n<br>\n\nHer disdain for FaunaMart sparked an idea—a rival store. She envisioned [NanaEleven](https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?feature=shared&t=1257), a business that would stand in stark contrast to FaunaMart, offering fair prices and ethical practices. It was a bold plan, but one she tucked away for another time.\n\n<br>\n\n\nFor now, Napoleaon turned her attention to catching up on dungeon explorations. She joined forces with Ina, Shiori, Cecilia, and Bijou to tackle the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*.

Despite the obstacles, they emerged victorious, recovering [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?feature=shared&t=9426) of Takanashi Kiara.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs the day wound down, Napoleaon crossed paths with the Hot Pink One, leading to one of the most baffling conversations of her life. Topics ranged from love triangles to side chicks, with Napoleaon hilariously mistaking Raora for the actual Hot Pink One. \n<br>\n\n[Mixing up the pinks](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?t=9784)\n\n",

With a grin, she shrugged it off, [“No winner, no problem,”](https://www.youtube.com/live/E2JxBxhda9I?feature=shared&t=736) as the jackpot continued to grow.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHer excitement was interrupted when she noticed some unusual activity behind her store. Curious, Fauna went to investigate, only to find Gura constructing [gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/E2JxBxhda9I?feature=shared&t=767). The sight left her both surprised and concerned. While it wasn’t necessarily bad in itself, the looming presence of a gallows behind FaunaMart seemed like questionable symbolism for her business, potentially scaring off customers.\n\n<br>\n\n\nStill, business waited for no one, and Fauna quickly shifted her focus back to her enterprise. Utilizing intelligence from her secret sources, she learned of an exploit in the kingdom’s systems. Blocks like lanterns could be broken and collected, and over time, they would regenerate. Fauna immediately saw the potential for an infinite resource farm. Since these blocks were in high demand, she decided to gather and resell them at “reasonable prices.” With a smirk, she declared it the dawn of a new era for FaunaMart and dove into the task.\n\n<br>\n\n[A new era for FaunaMart](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/E2JxBxhda9I?t=1010)\n<br>\n\n\nAs she was gathering materials to sell, her plan was found out by Bijou, the kirin quickly extracted a [promise](https://www.youtube.com/live/E2JxBxhda9I?feature=shared&t=1100) not to reveal her new business idea. Soon after, Fauna joined forces with Gura and Jyonathan to explore the Eldritch Horror Dungeon. Along the way, the trio indulged in lighthearted banter.

But that was just the kind of chaotic energy the green lady brought with her (see [Cecilia-Bijou: Royal Protector](#edge:koseki-bijou-cecilia-immergreen-right-2-bottom-2)).\n<br>\n\nWithout much of a personal goal to pursue, Cecilia spent the day wandering around and chatting with people. Unlike others who were actively taking on quests, she had little motivation to do so. After all, she now had a princess to leech off for money—what more could she ask for? Life was easy, and she was thriving.\n<br>\n\nBut with so much free time on her hands, Cecilia’s mind started brewing something interesting. Something ambitious. Something that, if anyone were to hear it, would immediately put her status as both a hero and a knight into question.\n<br>\nShe would take over the kingdom. Simple as that.\n<br>\n\n[Crazy green lady's crazy idea](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/yK3QZkOZ6bE?feature=shared&t=4153)\n<br>\n\nThe plan? Bijou would be the key. As a princess, she held the perfect status for Cecilia’s scheme. She would gain Bijou’s trust, slowly but surely, winning her over with charm and unwavering loyalty. And once the gem maiden was completely dependent on her? Cecilia would place her on the throne and pull the strings from the shadows, controlling her like a puppet. A royal usurpation, hidden behind a façade of loyalty.\n<br>\n\nIf the already questionable crackhead theories about the kingdom weren’t enough to cast doubts on Cecilia’s sanity, well—this certainly would.\n<br>\n\n[\"The Knight Chooses Her Ruler\" by BlaParky](#out:https://x.com/BlaParky/status/1831222642730516798)",

Much like the previous day, her goals were simple: go with the flow, build her house, and rake in as much money as possible.\n\n<br>\n\n\nEarly in the day, Nerissa stumbled upon Gura’s latest project—a [gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/dRCvSHBTvSk?feature=shared&t=1198). The sight triggered an odd memory from her past life, though it wasn’t a pleasant one. The memory was hazy but carried the guilt of a criminal past. Shaking it off, she decided to help Gura test the gallows by volunteering Jyonathan as a participant.\n\n<br>\n\n\nNot long after, Fauna recruited Nerissa to work at FaunaMart, officially dubbing her an employee. During a chat with Raora, Nerissa learned about a money exploit that had everyone in the kingdom buzzing. Naturally, this piqued her interest, and she dove headfirst into the scheme. In just 94 minutes, the money-hungry raven amassed a fortune of over 6.9 thousand coins. Her relentless pursuit of wealth even led her to decline Cecilia’s invitation to join Bijou’s knights—money, after all, was the priority.\n\n<br>\n\n\nFlush with cash and satisfied with her grind, Nerissa joined Elizabeth and Raora to tackle the *Volcanic Dungeon*. The group’s teamwork led to a successful run, and they recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/dRCvSHBTvSk?feature=shared&t=15014) of *Takanashi Kiara*.\n\n<br>\n\n\nNerissa’s day was shaping up to be smooth and fulfilling. She had made a fortune, spent quality time with friends, and even braved a dungeon. It felt like a peaceful, productive day. That was until Mococo approached her with a request—lottery tickets. Not even Nerissa could expect such a simple confrontation would later throw a wrench into her tranquility in this kingdom (see [Mococo-Nerissa: Lottery Fiasco](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-nerissa-ravencroft-right-2-right-1) and [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Heartbroken](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-3-left-2))\n\n",

Her day began with a tour of Queen Mario’s (formerly known as Raora) magnificent new [castle](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?feature=shared&t=505), a structure that left her thoroughly impressed. Feeling inspired, she met with Cecilia to showcase her own recent project: her lucky Moai Statue.\n<br>\n\n[Gacha Moai Statue](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?t=818)\n<br>\n\nIt was amidst these events that Bijou claimed her title of Princess, but not just any princess, the Princess of the Kingdom of Evergreen, with Cecilia as her knight (see Cecilia-Bijou: Knight of Evergreen). Everyone around her seemed to be claiming grand titles like queens, so why not stake her own claim? Adding to the familial drama, she also announced that Queen Mario was now her mother, making her the proud daughter of two mothers: Elizabeth and Mario (see [Mario-Bijou: Mommy!](#edge:raora-panthera-koseki-bijou-bottom-2-top-2)).\n<br>\n\n\nLater in the day, Bijou joined forces with Shiori, Ina, Cecilia, and the whimsically named Napoleon Galileo Aristotle Targaryen to take on the Eldritch Horror Dungeon. Their quest was [successful](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?feature=shared&t=8517), though the celebratory moments took a bizarre turn with everyone indulging in some peculiar [licking antics](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?feature=shared&t=9603). \n\n<br>\n\nAnyway, they quickly regrouped for the *Volcanic Dungeon*, with Calli stepping in to replace Cecilia. The fiery dungeon proved particularly tough for Bijou, with several [\"bweh\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?feature=shared&t=10341) moments along the way, but the team triumphed in the end, recovering [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?feature=shared&t=13502) of *Takanashi Kiara*.\n<br>\n\nAs the day wound down, Bijou returned to the firey dungeon, this time assisting Mococo and the Hot Pink One. After successfully lending her support, she called it a day. Bijou’s journey felt quieter compared to her earlier adventures—perhaps her drive had dimmed after achieving her ultimate goal of securing a hat.\n<br>\n\nWhat lay ahead for the rock princess? Would she find a new purpose to ignite her spark? Only time would tell.\n",

Despite the peculiarity of this announcement, he went along with it. Shortly after, he [introduced](https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared&t=736) Cecilia to his wife—his beloved \"Pearl\"—and shared his first interaction with Gura, who caused him quite the bit of headache throughout the day (see [Gonathon-Gura: Little Gnome Boy](#edge:gonathon-g-gawr-gura-bottom-1-right-2)).\n<br>\n\n[Keep my wife safe](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared&t=806)\n<br>\n\n\nWith the conversations out of the way, Gonathon shifted his focus back to his duties. As mentioned on day three, Tam Gandr, his queen, had embarked on an expedition and entrusted Gonathon with managing the kingdom in her absence. To honor her legacy, Gonathon resolved to construct a monumental commemorative statue of the queen. He began laying the groundwork for this ambitious project, determined to see it through despite the immense effort it would require.\n\n<br>\n\n\nTaking a break from the statue, Gonathon joined his wife and Gura to tackle the day’s dungeon—the *Volcanic Dungeon*. Navigating its perilous traps and obstacles, he valiantly tried to maintain his composure in front of his wife, though his pride took a hit as he repeatedly fell and screamed his way through the challenges.\n<br>\n\n[Tottaly made it](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared&t=7796)\n<br>\n\n\nAfter a hard-fought victory in the dungeon and recovering memories of [Takanashi Kiara](https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared&t=8112), Gonathon returned to work on the queen’s statue. It was then that Elizabeth approached him, expressing her disapproval of the project, given her rocky relationship with Tam. Refusing to let her disdain deter him, Gonathon confronted Elizabeth, but their heated exchange resulted in her locking him up in a tavern.\n<br>\n\n[What was that just now?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared&t=11555)\n<br>\n\nBy sheer luck, Gonathon managed to escape and shifted his focus to other matters. Acting on a report from Nerissa that Mococo was a criminal, Gonathon set out to hunt her down, albeit with no concrete evidence. \n<bR>\n[Doghunt](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared&t=12009)\n<br>\n\nUnsatisfied with the lack of clarity, he challenged Elizabeth—Mococo’s guildmate—to a duel in hopes of extracting more information. Unfortunately, he lost the duel and, in an act of pettiness, enlisted Nerissa to deliver a stinging blow to Elizabeth’s pride by saying she hated her.\n<br>\n\n[Is this what knights do?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared&t=12872)\n<br>\n\nDespite his questionable actions, Gonathon redeemed himself by ending the day on a noble note. He joined Nerissa, Fuwawa, and the Hot Pink One in conquering the Eldritch Horror dungeon and later assisted Fuwawa in the Volcanic Dungeon.\n\n",

Despite this revelation, Gura felt largely unchanged. With her memories recovered but no burdens weighing her down, she eagerly embarked on another adventure in the kingdom.\n\n<br>\n\n\nEverywhere Gura turned, constructions upon constructions were popping up: FaunaMart, Calli’s diner, Raora’s castle, and more. Inspired, Gura decided it was time to create something of her own. Observing the kingdom’s rising crime rate, she settled on building… *[a gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=665)*. This contraption would serve as a beacon of justice, imprisoning wrongdoers and even incorporating public participation—citizens could throw eggs at the convicted for added flair.\n<br>\n\n[Listing out crimes](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=2395)\n<br>\n\nGura meticulously planned the structure, envisioning trapdoors for the guilty to drop through and cells to hold them indefinitely. With her enthusiasm at an all-time high, she dove headfirst into construction.\n<br>\n\n\nAs she worked, Fauna approached, seemingly talking to herself. Gura concluded that Fauna might be the town’s resident [schizophrenic](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=3549). When Fauna noticed the gallows being built right behind FaunaMart, she expressed her concerns, fearing it might deter customers or project an ominous image for her store. Gura, however, assured her that justice required such measures.\n\n<br>\n\n[Why are there gallows?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?t=4184)\n<br>\n\nLater, Gura met Jyonathan and invited her on a trip to the Eldritch Horror Dungeon. Jyonathan agreed, but only if Gura paid her a fee of 50 coins and informed her husband, Gonathon, of their plans. Begrudgingly, Gura complied. At the same time, the mischievous shark used the opportunity to stress out the poor wedded knight (see [Gonathon-Gura: Little Gnome Boy](#edge:gonathon-g-gawr-gura-bottom-1-right-2)). With Fauna joining their party, the trio set off on their adventure. Their efforts culminated in the recovery of Ninomae Ina’nis’ memories (which Gura had not prepared [beforehand](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=7552)), marking a successful expedition.\n<br>\n\nBack in the kingdom, while working on her gallows, Gura was approached by Cecilia and other Scarlet Wand members. Cecilia revealed a clandestine plan to seize control of the princess and the kingdom. Unaware of the princess’s identity or Cecilia’s motivations, Gura was thoroughly baffled throughout the [discussion](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=11248). Nonetheless, she proudly introduced her gallows as a potential asset to their scheme, only to discover a critical flaw: criminals could escape using a magical tome.\n<br>\n\n[The flaws in her gallows](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?t=11368)\n<br>\n\nUndeterred, Gura teamed up with Gonathon and Jyonathan to tackle the *Volcanic Dungeon*. The dungeon posed significant challenges, but its intricate contraptions fascinated Gura, who marveled at their [ingenuity](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=15828). The team ultimately emerged victorious, recovering [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=16175) of *Takanashi Kiara*.\n<br>\n\nWith another successful day behind her, Gura called it a night, her mind racing with plans for justice, adventures, and perhaps some revisions to her gallows.\n",

Without hesitation, she accepted. It was the perfect opportunity to finally spend some quality time alone with the enigmatic maiden in blue.\n<br>\n\n\nBefore the adventure, Elizabeth decided to take a stroll around town with Raora. By chance, they stumbled upon Nerissa in the casino. Though their financial situations couldn’t be more different—Nerissa with her overflowing wealth and Elizabeth barely scraping together two digits—the scarlet knight decided to join her anyway. For Elizabeth, the amount didn’t matter. What mattered was the chance to bask in Nerissa’s presence.\n<br>\n\n[\"Date\" at the casino](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?t=1716)\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs they played, Elizabeth found herself captivated by Nerissa’s elegance. She couldn’t help but admire every little thing about her—the way she moved, her radiant beauty—it was as if she was under a spell. But her daydream ended abruptly when she lost all her money in the game. Flustered and embarrassed, Elizabeth jokingly accused Nerissa of tricking her, though deep down, she couldn’t stay upset for long.\n<br>\n\n\nWhen the time came to conquer the Volcanic Dungeon, the two set off together. However, as they navigated the dungeon’s many challenges, Elizabeth’s suspicions only grew. Nerissa’s uncanny ability to avoid traps seemed too good to be true. Passing lasers effortlessly? Witch. Walking through fire unharmed? Witch. Catching Elizabeth mid-thought as she mentally accused her of being a witch? Definitely a [witch](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=3234).\n<br>\n\n\nDespite the accusations, Elizabeth’s thoughts kept drifting back to Nerissa. She was drawn to her, inexplicably and undeniably. The scarlet knight found herself unable to look away, observing every move Nerissa made with a mix of fascination and disbelief.\n<br>\n\n\nElizabeth had fun—more fun than she’d had in a long time. She cherished every second spent with Nerissa, even with all the “witch” framing. And though Nerissa teased her, it felt like their bond was growing stronger. Elizabeth began to hope that maybe, just maybe, these feelings she couldn’t shake had real meaning, like birds with their trees, like bees with their flowers, like Romeo with his Juliet.\n<br>\n\n[Romeo, oh Romeo~](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?t=6831)\n\n<br>\n\n\nAt one point, Elizabeth even tried to [trap](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=7576) Nerissa, all for the sake of sharing music with her. But Nerissa, with her usual wit and grace, escaped easily. Of course, Elizabeth blamed it on witchcraft, but she couldn’t deny the joy she felt during these moments.\n<br>\n\nBut the day took a harsh turn when Elizabeth found herself in a duel against Gonathon. The knight demanded information about Mococo’s whereabouts, which Elizabeth refused to give. She emerged victorious, but Gonathon had an ace up his sleeve—Nerissa.\n\n<br>\n\n[Say those words, you witch](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?t=8527)\n<br>\n\nAs a spectator, Nerissa had allied herself with Gonathon for protection against Mococo. He warned Elizabeth that if she didn’t cooperate, Nerissa would declare her hatred for her. Elizabeth put on a brave face, but when Nerissa coldly said the words, the scarlet knight crumbled.\n<br>\n\n\nTears flowed as Elizabeth’s heart shattered. Everything they’d built, every shared moment, felt meaningless now. Nerissa’s rejection confirmed her worst fears—perhaps these feelings were all part of some cruel spell.\n<br>\n\n\nDistraught, Elizabeth wandered aimlessly, seeking comfort from [strangers](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=8651) and throwing her remaining coins away at the casino. Yet nothing eased her pain. She was left poorer and emptier than before, her heart heavy with regret and longing.\n<br>\n\n[She's lost it](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=8768)\n<br>\n\nFor Elizabeth, the day ended in despair, but a small part of her still clung to hope. Maybe, just maybe, things could be mended. Perhaps the maiden in blue wasn’t a witch after all, but someone truly special—someone worth fighting for.\n<br>\n\n[\"BloodRaven\" by Keisea](#out:https://x.com/Keiseeaaa/status/1831435229753700756)\n",

Ever since tying the knot with Jyonathan, his days had been spent fending off external threats—namely, other so-called \"heroes\" attempting to steal his beloved away. And today was no different. A new challenger had entered the fray.\n<br>\n\n\nGura wasn’t usually one to meddle in other people’s affairs. She preferred keeping to herself, letting the world move on without her interference. Yet, for some inexplicable reason, every time she crossed paths with Jyonathan, an itch would surface—an urge to mess with the blonde maiden.\n<br>\n\nAnd Jyonathan? She didn’t mind one bit. In fact, she relished in Gura’s mischievous antics, engaging in the playful back-and-forth with just as much enthusiasm.\n\n<br>\n\n\nFor Gonathon, this dynamic was nothing short of a waking nightmare.\n<br>\n\n[I'm taking your wife out](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?t=12810)\n<br>\n\nThe two troublemakers flirted—implicitly, but just enough to fuel [misunderstandings](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=11832). Gura’s way with words was already vague enough to raise eyebrows, but Jyonathan didn’t hesitate to lean in, adding fuel to the fire. Each message, each interaction was a fresh stab to the poor knight’s sanity.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nFrom secretive, suggestive phone calls to planning spontaneous outings behind Gonathon’s back (sometimes with, sometimes without his reluctant approval), the duo seemed hellbent on testing the knight’s patience. At one point, they even conspired against him, theorizing that Gonathon was carrying some sort of disease just because of his fondness of [cheese](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=8820), spreading it to everyone around him like a plague-ridden rat.\n<br>\n\nWas it all in good fun? Probably. But for Gonathon, it was an ordeal.\n<br>\n\nSomewhere along the way, though, an odd camaraderie formed between the unlikely trio. Beneath the layers of teasing and chaos, Gura and Gonathon found common ground—or at least enough of it to compare the length and girth of their hats.\n<br>\n\n[Big Gnome Man](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?si=cUCbHoToUYsfGNWz&t=13728)\n<br>\n\n[\"Pearl...\" by aWoooFa](#out:https://x.com/Awooofa/status/1831403586494017956)\n",

So, when she spotted Bijou adorned with her gleaming gem-studded crown, Cecilia immediately knelt before her and swore her allegiance, pledging to become the Gem Princess’s loyal knight. \n\n<br>\n\n[The royal protector](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/yK3QZkOZ6bE?t=842)\n<br>\n\nRaora, who aspired to royalty but lacked a crown, did not receive the same honor—because, well, no crown, no knighthood.\n<br>\n\nHowever, Cecilia wasn’t content with the plain title of “knight.” It lacked the grandeur she envisioned, so she promoted herself to *“Lord Protector of the Princess of the Kingdom of Evergreen”*. While impressive in title, her qualifications for the role were... questionable at best. For one, she was perpetually broke. Her poverty stemmed from her steadfast refusal to complete side quests, a critical income source in the kingdom. Instead, Cecilia developed a reputation as a professional leech, always relying on others to get by.\n\n<br>\n\nDespite her shortcomings, Bijou seemed to enjoy her company, which was all that mattered. Cecilia even went out of her way to craft a small, makeshift [throne](https://www.youtube.com/live/yK3QZkOZ6bE?feature=shared&t=3190) for her princess—an endearing, if slightly shabby, gesture of devotion.\n\n<br>\n\nCecilia briefly attempted to recruit Nerissa into joining her knightly ranks, but Nerissa politely [declined](https://www.youtube.com/live/yK3QZkOZ6bE?feature=shared&t=3679). Though disappointed, Cecilia took pride in being Bijou’s sole knight... or so she thought. That pride was shattered when Bijou hired another knight, Ina, after Cecilia showed up late to a critical dungeon quest. (In her defense, she’d gotten lost again—a recurring issue that raised serious doubts about her aptitude for the job.) Still, as the self-proclaimed [\"senpai\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/yK3QZkOZ6bE?feature=shared&t=5511) knight, Cecilia consoled herself by believing her seniority gave her special importance.\n\n<br>\n\nWhether Cecilia’s dedication to the princess was purely out of loyalty or if there was something more behind her eagerness remained to be seen. For now, the Gem Princess’s quirky knight continued her duties with enthusiasm, however misguided they might be.\n\n",

Her addiction to gambling consumed her, and every morning, her first thought was the lottery—buying new tickets and eagerly checking if she'd struck gold from the previous batch. On the other side of this chaotic equation was Nerissa, freshly starting her internship at FaunaMart. Unfortunately for her, Mococo was her first customer, and the day was destined for disaster.\n\n\n<br>\n\n[New face, new trouble](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?t=902)\n<br>\n\nAs usual, Mococo's morning quest led her straight to FaunaMart, where Nerissa was managing the counter in Fauna’s absence. Mococo eagerly requested her usual batch of lottery tickets, and Nerissa, still adjusting to her role, complied. However, her struggles with math led to a mistake in the initial calculation, which Mococo quickly corrected. Keep this detail in mind.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nSensing Nerissa’s inexperience, Mococo saw an opportunity. She tried to convince the blue-haired maiden that she had won a significant prize from the previous lottery batch, demanding her payout. Fortunately, Nerissa was cautious and messaged her boss, Fauna, to confirm. Besides, Nerissa didn’t even have enough coins to cover the supposed jackpot, which kept the money safe—for the moment. But Mococo wasn’t one to back down easily. Her claws came out—literally—and she began threatening Nerissa for not handing over her “winnings.”\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nIn a desperate attempt to resolve the escalating tension, Nerissa agreed to a duel. If Mococo won, Nerissa would pay her the money. What Nerissa hadn’t accounted for was how far Mococo’s hunger for money could push her. The duel was brief and decisive—Mococo emerged victorious. Nerissa, realizing she was outmatched, tried to escape, but Mococo’s feral determination drove her to chase Nerissa down, claws glinting with menace.\n<br>\n\n[Give me your money!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?t=1251)\n\n<br>\n\n\nCornered and exhausted, Nerissa reluctantly handed over 3,000 coins to Mococo, hoping it would end the madness. To her horror, Mococo immediately spent every last coin on more lottery tickets. But the chaos didn’t end there. Due to another calculation blunder, Nerissa accidentally gave Mococo 680 tickets instead of the requested 300. Mococo noticed the error but this time, said nothing—why would she?\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhen Nerissa later discovered her mistake and confronted Mococo about it, the pup wasn’t having [any of it](https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?feature=shared&t=1602). She turned hostile, threatening to attack Nerissa if she tried to take back even a single ticket. Panicked, Nerissa sought protection from Gonathon and The Hot Pink One, exaggerating the situation by claiming Mococo had placed a 50,000-coin bounty on her head (a blatant lie). The two knights sprang into action, hunting down Mococo and eventually cornering her. The poor dog cried for help as she was trapped, the tables turned.\n<br>\n\n[I'm not a criminal, I'm Mococo!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?t=2432)\n\n<br>\n\n\nFeeling guilty over how things had spiraled out of control—largely due to her own mistakes—Nerissa tried to [apologize](https://www.youtube.com/live/dRCvSHBTvSk?feature=shared&t=17789) to Mococo. But the dog remained firm, refusing to return any tickets. Instead, she demanded a lawyer and insisted on settling the matter in court.\n\n<br>\n\nThe drama at FaunaMart had turned into a full-blown fiasco, leaving Nerissa questioning her decision to take this internship and Mococo as determined as ever to cash in big—or at least make her case in front of a jury.\n",

Mococo wasn’t about to let the previous day’s events slide, so she confronted FaunaMart to set things straight—this time, with her trusty lawyer by her side. But Fauna and her gang, especially Nerissa, weren’t backing down either. And so, the two sides engaged in an intense legal battle, arguments flying back and forth as they fought to prove their case.\n<br>\nLater on, after clearing up the misunderstanding from the previous day, Elizabeth and Nerissa were back to their usual shenanigans. However, this time, their playful back-and-forth turned even more lovey-dovey. The two spent the entire day together, practically glued at the hip. Well, it was mostly Nerissa sticking to Elizabeth—the blue lady simply refused to leave the knight alone.\n\n<br>\n\nNot only that, but this day was sidechick galore. The Hot Pink One, finally unleashing her true potential, went on a spree, collecting sidechicks left and right, until she was surrounded by a polygamous entourage of women everywhere she went.\n\n<br>\n\nFinally, getting back to the actual main quests, the heroes tackled their last dungeon in the kingdom—The [*Ancient Sewer Dungeon*](#out:https://x.com/hololive_En/status/1831512579405181432). Unlike the previous dungeons, this one was less about brute force and more about wit, with puzzles designed to test the heroes' recollection of everything they had learned during their time in the kingdom. And upon conquering it, they were rewarded with a Warp Crystal, crafted by none other than [Amelia Watson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDmyL6CuzBU) herself.\n<br>\n\n[A riddle inside the dungeon](#image:images-opt/sewer.webp)",

[*“Is Mococo going to the lottery again?”*](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared&t=346) she wondered, her concern for her companion growing deeper with each passing day. Though she cared for Mococo, this time, Fuwawa decided to stay on the sidelines, watching the fiasco unfold without stepping in. After all, it wasn’t her battle to fight.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs she contemplated her plans for the day, Fuwawa realized that she lacked a clear goal. Since arriving in the kingdom, she’d simply gone with the flow, completing her tasks dutifully and being the good doggo everyone expected her to be. But now, she craved something of her own—something to give her purpose.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe idea of creating a [garden](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared&t=1460) began to blossom in her mind. Unlike the grand gallows, bustling businesses, and massive statues others were constructing, Fuwawa wanted a small, peaceful space where she could relax and feel at ease. She turned to Elizabeth for help, and the breadlady eagerly agreed.\n\n<br>\n\nThe garden project would have to wait, though, as there were other pressing matters to attend to. Fuwawa started preparing for the final dungeon, and during a visit to the king’s castle turned unsettling for Fuwawa. As she left the castle, she heard blood-curdling screams and the sound of a heavy thud, like someone had fallen. The eerie noises left her stunned and utterly baffled, a chilling moment she couldn’t shake off.\n<br>\n\n[A fluffy adventure turned horror](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?t=3643)\n<br>\n\nShe then joined Shiori, Elizabeth, Nerissa, and Mococo on a quest to the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*. Together, they conquered the challenges within and recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared&t=5921) of *Amelia Watson*. Before this, Fuwawa also acted as a witness to Mococo’s settlement for the lottery situation, observing with discomfort as Mococo negotiated for 10,000 coins and received a barrage of [kisses](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared&t=3342) in the process.\n<br>\n\n\nAs if her day wasn’t strange enough, Fuwawa’s clumsiness landed her in yet another predicament—this time, trapped in the gallows. She had to call for help, feeling equal parts embarrassed and grateful when others came to her rescue.\n<br>\n\n[Fluffy one fluffily stuck](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared&t=7589)\n<br>\n\nToward the evening, Fuwawa took things slow, enjoying her usual laid-back routine. She planted crops, completed small tasks, and found herself stumbling upon a peculiar [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared&t=9526) in the under-construction library. Though the topic left her thoroughly confused, she still managed to help Elizabeth save Nerissa, who (perhaps intentionally) had gotten herself [trapped](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared&t=10522).\n",

To most of the kingdom, she was now a criminal, though she still had a small circle of allies she could trust. It all started on the fourth day when she tried to trick Nerissa into giving her more lottery tickets and, in frustration, chased the raven lady with claws after failing to extort her. Despite the chaos she caused, Mococo somehow convinced herself that she was the victim, citing the emotional distress of being hunted down as proof.\n\n<br>\n\n[The fuzzy one is furious](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/wINOVotsvPY?si=L90uk7TJtyW8XYLY&amp;start=447)\n<br>\n\nWhen the fifth day’s winning lottery number was announced and her prize was split three ways, her frustration boiled over. Fauna’s offer of 8,000 coins to settle the matter wasn’t enough for Mococo, who demanded 10,000 coins instead and decided to hire Cecilia as her lawyer—not the greatest choice, given Cecilia’s ties to FaunaMart (see [Cecilia-Mococo: Better Call Cecilia](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-cecilia-immergreen-top-2-left-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe situation quickly spiraled out of control. Nerissa, the cause of Mococo’s suffering (and, conversely, a victim of Mococo’s antics), joined the fray, and the argument heated up. One by one, more people got involved—Gonathon, Raora, Elizabeth, Bijou—the scene turned chaotic. Mococo, overwhelmed and faced with threats of being banned from the lottery or dragged to the gallows, couldn’t take it anymore. In a panic, the pink-furred dog fled the scene.\n\n<br>\n\n[The fuzzy one is stressed out](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/wINOVotsvPY?si=iz0DZqwF_-qmqcU7&amp;start=1604)\n<br>\n\nThe only solace Mococo could find was with [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared&t=1817). The knight in red, ever protective, built a bunker for her to hide in. For a while, Mococo wandered aimlessly, evading those she believed were hunting her. Eventually, a compromise was reached, with Nerissa (likely too exhausted to argue further) agreeing to a settlement with Mococo (see [Nerissa-Mococo: A Resolution](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-nerissa-ravencroft-right-2-right-1)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nWith her name cleared and the ordeal behind her, Mococo returned to the kingdom’s tasks. She joined Shiori, Fuwawa, Elizabeth, and Nerissa in tackling the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*, where they successfully recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared&t=5922) of *Amelia Watson*. Later, Shiori approached Mococo with a peculiar request, asking if she’d like to join her “Happy Sugar Life” as a pet. Mococo politely declined, only to have her belly button [insulted](https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared&t=8600) by the eccentric black-and-white lady.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs the day wound down, Mococo reflected on how different things had become. Freed from the shackles of the lottery, she realized that if she wanted more money, she’d have to work for it. With ticket prices now inflated and memories of the fiasco still fresh, she decided to steer clear of the lottery entirely. Glancing at the looming gallows behind FaunaMart—a grim reminder of how close she’d come to disaster—Mococo vowed never to let herself fall into such a mess again.\n<br>\n\n[I better stay away](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared&t=10971)",

So, when that light dimmed, an emptiness overtook her. The breaking point came on the fourth day when Nerissa, someone she cherished, told her, “I hate you.” Those three words shattered her.\n<br>\n\n[My only guiding light](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?t=183)\n<br>\n\n\nThis moment of heartache might have spiraled into a prolonged reflection on her part, but it was quickly derailed—by none other than Nerissa herself.

Attempts to dive back into monologues were thwarted at every turn, so she gave up [entirely](https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?feature=shared&t=1381). Her focus shifted when Mococo, surrounded by accusations of criminality from the previous day’s lottery fiasco, reached out to her. Ever loyal, Elizabeth promised to protect her. Together with Fuwawa, she set out to build a temporary hideout for Mococo, though the structure’s design unintentionally leaned more toward a prison—or perhaps even a grave.\n<br>\n\n[Wouldn't this scare her more?](#embed:(https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?feature=shared&t=2077))\n<br>\n\nLater, Elizabeth seized a rare quiet moment to resume her internal musings. She pondered the Scarlet Wand’s growing power and found herself oddly stirred by words like “harbinger” and, most notably, “justice.” But, as was becoming routine, her thoughts were abruptly interrupted—this time by her noisy neighbor [blasting music](https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?feature=shared&t=4393).\n<br>\n\n\nElizabeth’s day took a more adventurous turn when she joined Shiori, Nerissa, and the two doggos on a journey to the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*.

She also enjoyed a lighthearted chat with Jyonathan—now recalling that they were Amelia—about building an onsen and how Tam’s statue resembled a worm.

They visited the dungeon/prison Elizabeth was building, the gigantic statue of Tam Gandr under construction by Gonathon, and chatted about recent events, helping Jyonathan catch up on kingdom drama—such as Mococo’s lottery fiasco.\n<br>\n\n[Walking around with Elizabeth](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/uyOxBS0Cx8E?feature=shared&t=795)\n<br>\n\nAfter bidding Elizabeth farewell, it was finally time for Jyonathan to focus on her onsen project—nevermind, she went to the casino to gamble instead. Seemed like the blonde was very easily distracted. She spent quite a bit of time there and lost a lot of money, but she wasn’t too worried; after all, her husband’s pockets were deep, and she could always ask for an [allowance](https://www.youtube.com/live/uyOxBS0Cx8E?feature=shared&t=4140).\n<br>\n\nOkay, for real this time, Jyonathan got back on track and began construction on the onsen. She envisioned it as a place where everyone could gather and unwind after a long day of work. And, most importantly, a place where they could finally bathe.\n<br>\n\nAfter hours of effort, she finally completed something that matched what she had imagined.\n<br>\n\n[A tour around the onsen](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/uyOxBS0Cx8E?feature=shared&t=11366)\n<br>\n\nThe onsen’s atmosphere was warm and inviting, its wooden architecture bathed in the soft glow of dimly lit sea lanterns, giving it a cozy feel. Lush bushes of various kinds surrounded the exterior, creating a natural aesthetic. Upon entering, visitors would first see a reception table, welcoming them in. To the left sat the hot spring itself, its walls built of mossy cobblestone, holding a small stream of steaming water. A sakura tree stood gracefully by its side, adding a touch of tranquility to the setting. It was a breathtaking place, and frankly, it was surprising how Jyonathan managed to design and build it all in such a short amount of time.\n<br>\n\nWith its completion, the onsen joined the list of notable constructions built by the heroes.\n\n",

            "content": "\nRaora, or as she now preferred to be called, Queen Mario, was nearing the completion of her grand castle. This construction marked a significant milestone for her self-proclaimed royalty. She took immense pride in her achievement, having overseen and executed most of the work herself.\n\n<br>\n\n\nExcitedly, she gave a tour of the nearly [finished castle](https://www.youtube.com/live/xT6ChmC6CfU?feature=shared&t=315). Built with mossy stone bricks and wooden materials, it embodied the essence of a medieval fortress. The design included a front entrance and four watchtowers guarding its corners. Inside, the castle was divided into numerous rooms, most of which were still awaiting decoration. Raora, however, already had plans for them—a throne room, storage, and even a prison in the basement meant for the \"fake queen,\" Tam Tender.\n\n<br>\n\n\nOne room was an exception. Fully adorned in shades of purple, it was Bijou’s room, featuring a bed made from gleaming materials like diamond and gold.\n\n<br>\n\nRaora’s aspirations to be recognized as queen extended beyond titles and symbols. She sought to sway Gonathon, the loyal knight, to her side. Despite her efforts, Gonathon remained resolute, his heart already pledged to his own queen. Yet Raora was undeterred. She was determined to win over the kingdom, gain everyone’s trust, and solidify her rule.\n<br>\n\n[I'll make you realize, Gonathon](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xT6ChmC6CfU?feature=shared&t=2298)\n<br>\n\nWith the castle nearing completion, Raora began working on constructing the Amber Coin [logo](https://www.youtube.com/live/xT6ChmC6CfU?feature=shared&t=3389) in her guild’s area. This emblem would serve as a symbol of her reign, reinforcing her claim as the true queen.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLater in the day, Raora teamed up with Gonathon, Cecilia, Bijou, and the Hot Pink One to conquer the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*. The group succeeded in recovering [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/xT6ChmC6CfU?feature=shared&t=9528) of *Amelia Watson*.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe dungeon’s aftermath then brought an unusual twist—Hot Pink One approached Raora with a bold request: to take Bijou’s hand as her sidekick. After a moment of hesitation, Raora agreed, recognizing this as an opportunity to strengthen her position as queen. Her condition? The Hot Pink One must acknowledge Raora as the [true queen](https://www.youtube.com/live/xT6ChmC6CfU?feature=shared&t=11463).\n",

            "content": "\nFauna found her business embroiled in an unexpected predicament. After entrusting her store to Nerissa for just one day, she discovered it was now on the brink of a legal battle. This didn’t faze Fauna, though—after all, getting sued and encountering trouble was just part of running a business. She didn’t hold Nerissa responsible for the situation, especially since Nerissa somehow had twice as much money as Fauna (a fact that made Fauna question her position as the boss). While Nerissa panicked, Fauna, with the composure of a mafia-boss-like CEO, already had a plan.\n\n<br>\n\n[Everything is under control](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRM_kaxQBp4?si=--h9gdTm5mr013AR&amp;start=219)\n<br>\n\nFauna had evidence to counter Mococo’s claims. Despite Mococo’s insistence that she had won the previous day’s lottery, Fauna knew there had been no winnings for her. Even so, if Mococo continued to escalate the matter, Fauna had a backup plan: *a coupon*.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe coupon appeared innocent enough, offering a free ticket after purchasing nine, while including [survey questions](https://www.youtube.com/live/iRM_kaxQBp4?feature=shared&t=1965) about customer satisfaction and experience. It even featured a heartfelt “Your satisfaction is of utmost importance!” message to make it feel authentic. However, hidden in minuscule text at the bottom was a sneaky clause: “Terms and conditions may apply. Redemption of this coupon guarantees the redeemer will not sue FaunaMart in any court of law.” It was a calculated move, inspired by other corporations like \"Didney,\" ensuring Mococo would lose her ability to pursue legal action if she used the coupon.\n\n<br>\n\n[Just like how Didney does things](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRM_kaxQBp4?si=U8mtyjbb5ikJ4UON&amp;start=2186)\n<br>\n\nConfident in her strategy, Fauna shifted her focus back to the kingdom’s matters. She learned about the *\"Potato Salad Inflation\"*, a phenomenon that explained why Nerissa—and seemingly everyone else—was making far more money than her. Despite running a business, Fauna realized she was scraping for pennies while others swam in riches. Yet, she pressed on.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Fauna participated in her favorite daily event: the lottery drawing. The winning number of the day was [348](https://www.youtube.com/live/iRM_kaxQBp4?feature=shared&t=7229), and three winners emerged—Nerissa, Gonathon, and Mococo. This wasn’t surprising, as they had purchased the most tickets. To adapt to inflation, Fauna decided to raise the ticket price from 10 to 100 coins and allowed duplicate numbers to reduce the chances of winning. With these changes in place, she joined Nerissa and Cecilia on a trip to the Volcanic Dungeon, where they recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/iRM_kaxQBp4?feature=shared&t=11306) of Takanashi Kiara.\n\n<br>\n\n\nTowards the day’s end, Fauna decided it was finally time to fulfill her promise to the people: the construction of a library. As she laid the foundation, her biggest fear materialized—*[Mococo](https://www.youtube.com/live/iRM_kaxQBp4?feature=shared&t=14459)* arrived, furious. She accused Fauna of wrongful business practices, demanded an explanation for her unreceived winnings, and insisted her winnings should not have been split among three winners. Fauna, sticking to her plan, tried to pacify Mococo by offering her the coupon. However, Mococo was unmoved and demanded a 10,000-coin compensation for her suffering.\n\n<br>\n\n[Here comes Mococo](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRM_kaxQBp4?si=TRzxs5f1lA0eRfMp&amp;start=14555)\n<br>\n\nThe commotion escalated as Nerissa, Cecilia, Gigi, and even Mococo’s guardian, Elizabeth (wielding a giant sword), joined the scene. Arguments flew left and right, creating utter chaos. Finding the situation unbearable and recognizing it as an unwinnable battle for the day, Fauna, ever the responsible CEO, made a strategic decision—to [sneak away](https://www.youtube.com/live/iRM_kaxQBp4?feature=shared&t=15771). She left the others to handle the mess and went to sleep peacefully, deciding it would be someone else’s problem tomorrow.\n",

Initially intrigued, she considered joining in, but her interest quickly [waned](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=443). Shiori craved a peaceful life—free from economic worries, epic adventures, or romantic entanglements. Her simple, happy existence had always been the goal. The complicated relationships and headaches, like her multiple-wives situation, had been thrust upon her, not chosen.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLater in the day, Shiori joined the others to prepare for the final dungeon. Bijou, wife number one, proposed that Nerissa, wife number two, partner with Shiori for the dungeon, calling it Nerissa’s “turn.” Shiori, feeling like an [“Xbox”](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=1972) being passed around, agreed.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBefore diving into the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*, Shiori toured Raora’s newly built [castle](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=2112). The castle’s grandeur provided a brief respite before she grouped up with Nerissa, Fuwawa, Mococo, and Elizabeth to complete the dungeon. Their efforts resulted in recovering *Amelia Watson’s* [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=5872).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAfterward, Shiori received an urgent call from Gonathon, alerting her that Bijou might be claimed as a “side chick” by the Hot Pink One. Not only was Shiori's response to the situation surprising, the maiden also took the oportunity to torment the poor knight (see [Shiori-Gonathon: For My Collection](#edge:gonathon-g-shiori-nyavella-top-1-top-2))\n<br>\n\nOn a phone call with Bijou, Shiori entertained the idea of adding IRyS as her own side chick, creating a potential three-way relationship (see [Shiori-Hot Pink One: Side Chick No.3](#edge:shiori-nyavella-hot-pink-one-right-4-top-0)). Reflecting on the chaos of her romantic entanglements, Shiori resolved to stop being passive. If she was destined to navigate webs of relationships, she might as well take control. Her plan? To establish a *“Happy Sugar Life”* by creating a harem, finally earning the peace she longed for.\n<br>\n\n\nWith newfound determination, Shiori sought to expand her romantic circle. Taking advice from the voices in her head, she first approached [Mococo](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=8479), but her proposition was swiftly rejected. She tried [Fuwawa](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=8620) next, with similar results. When “chat” suggested contacting Elizabeth, Shiori declined, explaining she wasn’t particularly interested in moms.\n<br>\n\nWith her harem plan in motion, Shiori had turned her chaotic love life into a carefully managed harmony. While it wasn’t the quiet, humble existence she initially sought, it was a version of peace she could embrace. Together with her wives and side chicks, Shiori embarked on her “Happy Sugar Life,” ready to face whatever came her way.\n",

Armed with her \"expert\" legal knowledge, Cecilia advised Nerissa on court etiquette: avoid apologies and deny mistakes—no matter the truth. Despite the morally questionable guidance, Cecilia exuded confidence in her approach. \n\n<br>\n\n\nLater, she met Raora in a brief but tense encounter. Raora’s instincts hinted at Cecilia’s hidden motives, making her uneasy, or simply put, the pink cat was starting to doubt Cecilia's allegiance. Cecilia clarified her loyalties, claiming she would only betray Raora if Bijou, Raora’s daughter, turned against her. \n<br>\n\n[\"I would never betray you\"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2ATTd32AV-Q?t=1710)\n<br>\n\nCecilia then joined Nerissa and Fauna for a trek through the Volcanic Dungeon, where they recovered Takanashi Kiara’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/2ATTd32AV-Q?feature=shared&t=4084). With trust seemingly established, Cecilia decided to unveil her secret plan. \n<br>\n\n[More (crachkead) theory/plan](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ATTd32AV-Q?t=4221)\n<br>\n\nShe revealed her suspicion of the kingdom's king, theorizing that he was orchestrating the heroes’ missions for his own nefarious purposes. The supposed stains the heroes were tasked to combat had never been real, and the queen, Tam Gandr, was notably absent from the kingdom. Cecilia’s ultimate goal was to overthrow the king and establish the Scarlet Wand as rulers of the kingdom, under the guise of being the “good guys” (if you ignored their history of questionable deeds).\n<br>\n\n\nTo achieve her goal, Cecilia detailed an intricate scheme to possess the soul of the princess, Koseki Bijou. Her plan required:\n\n<br>\n\n* A gem of the deep sea\n* An item beloved by her target\n* Red powder of fantasy\n* A block of the hardest crystal\n* Flora\n* An ally\n\n<br>\n\nThrough an ancient ritual, Cecilia aimed to control Bijou as a puppet, granting her the means to seize power. Despite the ethical implications of her plan, Cecilia’s cheerful demeanor and innocent laugh seemed to mask her true intentions—or at least make them more palatable to her allies.\n<br>\n\nBefore initiating her scheme, Cecilia attended to other matters. Noticing her lack of gear compared to her peers, she resorted to asking others for equipment, avoiding the hard work herself. She also volunteered as Mococo’s lawyer in the lottery debacle (see [Cecilia-Mococo: Better Call Cecilia](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-cecilia-immergreen-top-2-left-2)). Despite having occupying about three different roles at this point (a knight, an employee, and a lawyer), Cecilia was still depressingly poor.\n<br>\n\n\nNext, she accompanied Bijou to investigate the king. The plan turned chaotic when an attempted assassination ended with Cecilia slipping and falling (see [Cecilia-Bijou: A Failed Coup](#edge:koseki-bijou-cecilia-immergreen-right-2-bottom-2)).\n<br>\n\n\nUndeterred, Cecilia joined Gonathon, Bijou, Raora, and the Hot Pink One in exploring the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*.

The source of her wealth remained a mystery, though an odd smell of potato salad seemed to accompany her wherever she went.\n\n<br>\n\n\nTurning to Cecilia for legal advice, Nerissa recounted the details of the Mococo fiasco. Cecilia provided guidance on how to present her case in court.\n<br>\n\n[Explaning the Mococo fiasco](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/iy0fMrzhwOY?t=1124)\n\n<br>\n\nThough their discussion was cut short by work duties. As FaunaMart employees, they were tasked with gathering leather for the library’s bookshelves. At the same time, Nerissa accompanied Fauna and Mumei to the Volcanic Dungeon to lend her support. Following their dungeon expedition, Nerissa indulged in some more gambling, [losing 500 coins](https://www.youtube.com/live/iy0fMrzhwOY?feature=shared&t=6495)—an insignificant dent in her wealth of over 50,000 coins.\n\n<br>\n\n\nMococo finally arrived, and Nerissa braced herself for the climax of the lottery drama. After numerous attempts and headaches, the two managed to resolve their differences. Mococo dropped her lawsuit, putting an end to the ordeal (see [Nerissa-Mococo: A Resolution](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-nerissa-ravencroft-right-2-right-1)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nWith one major issue resolved, Nerissa turned her attention to another: her misunderstanding with Elizabeth from day four.

As the self-proclaimed princess of the kingdom of Evergreen, she had everything a royal could wish for—a loyal knight, a queen for a mother (also self-proclaimed), and another mom with an undeniably cool name. Her royal life seemed perfect.\n\n<br>\n\n[Kira Kira, init, my fellow comrades](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/5o4TerH2bVI?si=2GpoastQ0CsBNmUe&amp;start=208)\n<br>\n\nThe day started on a high note as she visited her mother Raora’s newly built castle. Bijou was ecstatic to find a room specifically designed for her, complete with regal decor fit for a [princess](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared&t=544).\n<br>\n\n\nTrue to her title, Bijou spent her day engaging in what she deemed “princess-like” behavior, including [stalking](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared&t=2361) other residents of the kingdom. She also sought to turn her iconic moai statue into a perpetual music player, blasting tunes day and night to annoy her neighbors. To achieve this, she visited FaunaMart to purchase a [jukebox](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared&t=3164).\n\n<br>\n\n\nBijou’s royal ambitions then led her down a treacherous path. Alongside her trusted knight, Cecilia, she attempted to overthrow the kingdom’s ruler in a daring coup. While the coup didn’t go as planned, it cemented her reputation as a princess who kept things... interesting (see [Bijou-Cecilia: A Failed Coup](#edge:koseki-bijou-cecilia-immergreen-right-2-bottom-2))\n\n<br>\n\n\nAdding to her unconventional day, Bijou found herself entangled in polygamous relationships, extending her royal affections beyond her wives. It was clear that the princess had her priorities uniquely arranged (see [Irys-Bijou: Side Chick No.2](#edge:koseki-bijou-hot-pink-one-bottom-2-top-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nDespite her detours, Bijou eventually joined forces with the Hot Pink One, Raora, Cecilia, and Gonathon to tackle the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*. The group successfully recovered the [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared&t=9591) of *Amelia Watson*, adding another chapter to their shared adventures.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBack in the kingdom, Bijou stopped by the newly built FaunaMart *library*, which Nerissa was managing in Fauna’s absence. The library accepted donations of all book genres—from science and fantasy to, intriguingly, [BL and GL titles](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared&t=12928). As an avid writer of fanfiction, Bijou considered contributing some of her works.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs the day wound down, Bijou noticed Gonathon’s incomplete statue of his queen. Ever the mischievous princess, she couldn’t resist making some \"enhancements\" to the statue’s design, ensuring her mark on the kingdom would not be forgotten.\n<br>\n\n[We do a bit of trolling](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/5o4TerH2bVI?si=4Qt3b25iOtKX8tF9&amp;start=13468)\n",

With unwavering loyalty, he clashed back, defending his queen’s honor. He reminded Raora that his queen already had all those things: the guild base as her castle, a crown of her own, and most importantly, royal followers like him.\n\n<br>\n\n[Setting things straight](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/LSGUo-UnXwY?si=kRppaniN78G_vTUC&amp;start=1233)\n<br>\n\nAfter this exchange, Gonathon made his daily contribution to Fauna’s library, even though Tam had previously warned him it was a scam. During his visit, he noticed something peculiar—the looming gallows beside FaunaMart. Fauna explained its purpose: punishing those who didn’t know how to read. Though her reasoning was questionable (as she claimed it would teach empathy through reading), Gonathon decided not to comment. Perhaps it was for the greater good?\n<br>\n\n[A jail behind the library](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/LSGUo-UnXwY?feature=shared&t=1912)\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Gonathon joined Bijou, Raora, Cecilia, and the Hot Pink One to tackle the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*—a place rumored to be the final dungeon. Despite his usual knightly demeanor, Gonathon was surprisingly \"playful\" during this expedition. He spent his time running around trying to drink the dirty water and even managed to trick the others into taking a bath in the murky filth, much to Cecilia’s dismay.\n<br>\n\n[What a lovely bath](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/LSGUo-UnXwY?feature=shared&t=9423)\n<br>\n\n\nAt the end of their journey, the group recovered memories of [Amelia Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/LSGUo-UnXwY?feature=shared&t=8466). Gonathon was stunned to learn that his wife, his pearl, was none other than a famous detective with a storied history of great achievements. \n<br>\n\nPride and happiness filled his heart, but alongside these emotions came a creeping worry.

            "title": "Hot Pink One",
            "content": "The Hot Pink One began her fifth day feeling, well, hot and pink. After some time away, she returned to the kingdom eager to catch up—or so she thought. Something felt missing in her life. Wealth wasn’t the issue, and while adventures were entertaining, they weren’t fulfilling her deepest desires. It wasn’t until she reflected on her eternal consort, Nino Ina, that the answer hit her: why stop at one wife? If one brought so much joy, surely multiplying that joy by acquiring more wives was the solution!\n\n<br>\n\n\nWith a newfound clarity, she set her sights on expanding her royal entourage of love.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBefore tackling her new goal, the Hot Pink One needed to reconnect with the kingdom’s residents. She visited Gonathon, offering her commentary on the queen’s statue construction. She praised its height while teasingly emphasizing its flatness.\n\n<br>\n\n[She's quite tall and flat](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/gtOGWDKwQfY?feature=shared&t=829)\n<br>\n\n\nShe later joined forces with Gonathon, Raora, Bijou, and Cecilia on a quest to the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*. Together, they succeeded in recovering the lost memories of [Amelia Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/gtOGWDKwQfY?feature=shared&t=2173).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs the group returned to the kingdom, Cecilia, Bijou's newly appointed knight, prepared to call it a day. Seizing the moment, the Hot Pink One attempted to woo the gem princess to her side. Suggesting that Bijou would be safer as her knight instead, she poked at Cecilia’s pride. Unwilling to back down, the green knight challenged the Hot Pink One to a duel. Confident in her undefeated streak, the Hot Pink One emerged victorious once more.\n<br>\n\n[For a wife, I stand undefeated](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/gtOGWDKwQfY?feature=shared&t=3919)\n<br>\n\n\nThus, Koseki Bijou became her second wife—or, as the Hot Pink One preferred, Side Chick No.2 (see [Hot Pink One-Bijou: Side Chick No.2](#edge:koseki-bijou-hot-pink-one-bottom-2-top-2))\n\n<br>\n\n\nNot content with just two wives, the Hot Pink One continued her quest. Bijou, now wedded to Shiori, unexpectedly offered her wife to the Hot Pink One for reasons that remain unclear. The offer was accepted, and Shiori became Side-Chick No. 3. (see [Hot Pink One-Shiori: Side Chick No.3](#edge:shiori-nyavella-hot-pink-one-right-4-top-0))\n\n<br>\n\n\nHer ambitions didn’t stop there. In a bold (and obviously doomed) attempt, she even tried to woo Bijou’s mother. While the proposal didn’t pan out, the conversation led to a humorous exchange about the Tam Gandr statue.\n<br>\n\n[That timing](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/gtOGWDKwQfY?feature=shared&t=4506)\n<br>\n\n\nThe Hot Pink One’s day of romantic conquests continued as she added Nerissa to her growing entourage as Side Chick No.4 (see [Hot Pink One-Nerissa: Side Chick No.4](#edge:hot-pink-one-nerissa-ravencroft-left-2-right-2)). With three new wives acquired, the pink lady along with her newlyweds gathered a side-chick meetup at Shiori’s house, solidifying her dominance as the ultimate gatherer of love.\n<br>\n\n[Side Chick Polygamy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/gtOGWDKwQfY?feature=shared&t=5064)\n<br>\n\nLater, the Hot Pink One questioned Nerissa about allegations that FaunaMart was a scam. Nerissa defended the business, explaining that all funds were directed toward building a library. The Hot Pink One remained skeptical—after all, she was clever and not easily swayed. That was, until Nerissa mentioned the inclusion of BL books in the library’s collection.\n\n<br>\n\n[You got me invested](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/gtOGWDKwQfY?feature=shared&t=5448)\n<br>\n\nThe Hot Pink One ended her day with a series of lighthearted interactions. She attempted (and failed) to learn to fly but felt a deep satisfaction nonetheless. Surrounded by her newly expanded circle of side-chicks, she believed she could achieve anything, boasting with pride to those who weren't of the same caliber as her (see [Hot Pink One-Jyonthan: My Chicken Farm](#edge:ame-hot-pink-one-left-2-bottom-2))\n",

            "content": "\nElizabeth thought she'd gained something special—someone special. But it was a trick, a jest, a backstab, a betrayal. The previous day, Elizabeth had believed she'd finally connected with Nerissa, the one person who had been on her mind since the beginning of her journey. But alas, she had been played for a fool.\n<br>\n\n\"I hate you.\"\n<br>\n\nThree simple words, yet devastating enough to shatter the scarlet maiden’s heart into pieces. The damage was irreversible, the pain unbearable. The weight of it threatened to crush her entirely. Perhaps it wasn’t meant to be. Perhaps she was destined to be a knight and nothing more—just a servant of duty, bound to her sword, forever alone.\n<br>\n\nAnd so, she sunk into deep despair, lamenting how tragic and lonely her life would be...\n<br>\n\nFor about a minute.\n<br>\n\n[All that angst for nothing](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_dhGL0K5-k?si=OCYF7bUx3zTLXPnC&amp;start=1127)\n<br>\n\nBefore she could spiral any further, Nerissa called her. Her voice immediately shattered Elizabeth’s melodramatic thoughts, and what followed was an uncharacteristically desperate apology. Nerissa blamed Gonathon for forcing her to say those cruel words and begged for forgiveness, her voice wet and snotty with over-the-top whimpering. Elizabeth, hearing such pitiful pleading, had no choice but to forgive her. After all, as a knight, she had the duty to forgive and forget (or so she told herself).\n\n\n<br>\n\nThe emotional whiplash was so extreme that Elizabeth couldn't think straight for a good while. One moment she was wallowing in despair, the next she was right back where she started—bickering with Nerissa as if nothing had happened.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nIn fact, their relationship seemed to evolve from that point. Their arguments became even more frequent, resembling the kind of quarrels real couples would have (not that Elizabeth would ever admit that). Nerissa, of course, reveled in this, fully embracing her role as the chaos [gremlin](https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?feature=shared&t=2151) in Elizabeth’s life.\n\n\n<br>\n\n[We are not couples!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_dhGL0K5-k?si=OCYF7bUx3zTLXPnC&amp;start=7439)\n<br>\n\nEven when Nerissa genuinely tried to teach Elizabeth useful things—like how to break into closed-off buildings—Elizabeth would still call her a witch. It was practically a reflex at this point. Their constant bickering even led bystanders to mistake them for an actual couple, much to Elizabeth’s horror.\n\n<br>\n\nMeanwhile, Nerissa was putting in extra effort to grab Elizabeth’s attention, as if trying to make up for the previous day… or, more likely, just to mess with her. Unlike Elizabeth, Nerissa was completely open about her obsession. She tried sweet-talking, flirting, and when that didn't work, she even went so far as to trap herself on purpose just to bait Elizabeth into \"saving\" her—like a knight in shining armor rescuing a lost princess.\n\n<br>\n\n[Look at how stuck I am](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lv6_Xl1u_Ss?si=0HM9J2gK_-pRZCcx&amp;start=9690)\n\n<br>\n\nNerissa knew she was getting on Elizabeth’s nerves, and she enjoyed every second of it.\n\n<br>\n\n[\"she's cursed\" by Keisea](#out:https://x.com/Keiseeaaa/status/1831845649870160186)\n<br>\n\n[\"knight confronts the witch\" by DasDokter](#out:https://x.com/DasDokter/status/1831973884461298095)\n<br>\n\n[\"I love my girl failures\" by Adlo](#out:https://x.com/WaywardAdlo/status/1832901859667005729)\n",

            "content": "Nerissa found herself in quite the predicament—though, to be fair, so did Mococo. The two were at each other's throats, locked in a heated dispute. Nerissa wanted to resolve the whole lottery ticket fiasco in a peaceful manner, as she had been falsely accused in the first place. Meanwhile, Mococo was adamant about receiving compensation, hiring a lawyer, and pursuing a full lawsuit against FaunaMart.\n<br>\n\n\nTo support her case, Nerissa rallied her guildmates—Fauna, her CEO; Cecilia, her sharp-minded green-haired ally; and Gonathon, a knight she could trust—along with an abundance of evidence proving her innocence.\n\n\n<br>\n\nMococo, on the other hand had Elizabeth. Just Elizabeth.\n\n<br>\n\n\nTechnically, Cecilia was also her lawyer, but unbeknownst to Mococo, Cecilia was actually on Nerissa’s side (see [Cecilia-Mococo: Better Call Cecilia](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-cecilia-immergreen-top-2-left-2)). Fuwawa was also present, but she wanted nothing to do with the whole mess. With things stacked against her, it seemed Mococo had quite the uphill battle ahead.\n<br>\n\n[Dog and Bird duking it out](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?t=878)\n<br>\n\n\nNerissa presented her side first, explaining how she had mistakenly miscalculated Mococo's lottery ticket count but had promptly corrected the error. She wasn't asking for anything—she simply wanted Mococo to drop the lawsuit and move on. But instead, Mococo, allegedly, put a 50000 coin bounty on her head.\n\n<br>\n\nMococo, however, was not willing to back down.\n\n<br>\n\nThe doggo accused FaunaMart of engaging in improper business practices, claiming she had been scammed out of her lottery winnings, shortchanged on her rightful prize money, and—most damning of all—hunted down on orders from a FaunaMart employee, causing her immense emotional distress. As compensation, she demanded [*10,000 coins*](https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared&t=1310).\n<br>\n\nThe dispute grew more intense, with neither side willing to concede.\n<br>\n\nAt one point, someone suggested sending Mococo to the gallows for her so-called crimes, which—unsurprisingly—sent the poor pup into a full-blown panic. Overwhelmed with fear, she immediately fled, crying out in distress.\n<br>\n\n[Let's go to the gallows](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/wINOVotsvPY?si=BViZFZodzvRoTCtf&amp;start=1600)\n\n<br>\n\nBy this point, Nerissa was exhausted, mentally. She just wanted this entire ordeal to be over. Determined to put an end to the chaos, she chased after Mococo, tirelessly trying to negotiate a settlement. After what felt like an eternity, the dog finally ran out of energy and had no choice but to listen.\n\n<br>\n\nIn the end, Nerissa reluctantly agreed to pay Mococo the 10,000 coins. Mococo then added free kisses as part of the deal. Nerissa complied and gave her what she wanted. And with that, the great FaunaMart lawsuit was officially settled. Enemies turned back into friends once more. Yay.\n<br>\n\n[Well that was quick](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared&t=3185)\n\n",

Unsurprisingly, she didn’t. But in her defense, she had taken a bar exam before. (The keyword here being “taken”, not “passed”). Nonetheless, Mococo didn’t have much of a choice, so she accepted Cecilia as her lawyer anyway.\n<br>\n\nMococo wanted 10,000 coins in compensation for her suffering, but Fauna was only willing to offer 8,000. Cecilia advised Mococo to take the 8,000, claiming that she could always ask for more later—like an investment. (Not exactly sure how that worked, but okay.) But Mococo refused to settle, convinced that 10,000 was barely enough to compensate for her suffering.\n<br>\n\nFauna then made a different offer, giving Mococo a discount on lottery tickets, essentially making her a privileged customer, along with a “buy 9, get 1 free” coupon. Cecilia, once again, told Mococo it was a good deal. While it might have been questionable for a lawyer to keep agreeing to every offer made by the opposing side, Cecilia was secretly on Fauna’s side, so it made sense. Mococo, however, wasn’t interested in any of it and remained adamant about receiving the full 10,000.\n<br>\n\n[Not enough for my suffering](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2ATTd32AV-Q?feature=shared&t=7871)\n<br>\n\nThen Nerissa arrived, claiming she had evidence that Mococo had committed fraud and had framed her by placing a bounty on her head. The pressure was mounting, but Cecilia remained confident and undeterred. She consulted with Mococo, discussed matters with Fauna, and ultimately decided that the only way forward was to take this to the [high court](https://www.youtube.com/live/2ATTd32AV-Q?feature=shared&t=8270).\n<br>\n\nBut things only got worse from there. With Gonathon and Nerissa relentlessly pressing on the case—especially Gonathon, who kept rubbing in Cecilia’s complete lack of legal qualifications—the situation was quickly turning against them. With pressure coming from all sides, the doggo finally broke, running away in tears, leaving her lawyer behind to desperately argue that she was actually fit to be a lawyer.\n<br>\n\n['s all good, man](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2ATTd32AV-Q?t=8514)\n<br>\n\nLater on, the case somehow resolved itself—without Cecilia’s involvement.\n<br>\n\nYay! Happy news! So… where’s my paycheck?\n<br>\n\n[Another sucessful case](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2ATTd32AV-Q?feature=shared&t=10669)\n<br>\n\nDespite not actually doing anything to resolve the case, Cecilia still wanted her cut. She asked for 5% of the compensation as payment for all the hard work she had put into defending Mococo. And Mococo, being ever so generous and understanding, gave her 1.8% instead—which, all things considered, was fair.\n<br>\n\nHey, money is money. Cecilia was happy with it. Her first client, her first case (probably her last), and in the end, a successful outcome.\n",

And to many people’s shock… she actually won.\n<br>\n\nDespite this, Bijou still felt a twinge of guilt. After all, she was already bound in matrimony with Shiori.

This time, however, things escalated just a bit further. Nerissa boldly claimed she was pregnant with Elizabeth’s child, though neither she nor her so-called “child” lasted long. Kiara swiftly took matters into her own hands, disposing of both, straight-up cooking them.\n\n<br>\n\nLater in the day, Elizabeth took charge by organizing a tournament for everyone to participate in. It was a chance to sharpen their swordsmanship and prepare for the inevitable final showdown.\n<br>\n\n[Tournament Announcement](#image:images-opt/tournament.webp)\n<br>\n\nFauna also finally completed the long-promised library her business had pledged to build since opening. A long-overdue promise fulfilled at last.\n\n<br>\n\nBut on the darker side of things, Bijou made a chilling revelation. The hat she always wore—the Stain Hat—wasn’t just for decoration. The Stain was alive. It had been controlling her all along, and with this newfound awareness, she declared herself The Stain Princess and began plotting her takeover of the kingdom.\n\n<br>\n\nAdding to angsty atmosphere was the most heartbreaking moment since the start of this journey. The ever-strong bond between Gonathon and Jyonathan was shattered—not out of hatred, but something far worse. Jyonathan regained the memories of her past self, but in doing so, she lost the memories of her current one—forgetting everything about the life she had built and, most painfully, forgetting Gonathon. The love they once shared, now reduced to nothing more than a one-sided tragedy.\n",

A final battle against some great force loomed ahead, and the aftermath was uncertain. But for Elizabeth, the focus was on the present—making the most of their time and preparing for what was to come.\n\n<br>\n\n\nUpon joining the kingdom, Elizabeth noticed a missed call from Gonathon. She called him back, and he requested a private conversation. Given how rare one-on-one interactions with the knight were, Elizabeth couldn’t resist teasing him a little.\n\n<br>\n\n\nYet, as she listened to him, Elizabeth saw something in Gonathon she hadn’t fully appreciated before. His unwavering loyalty to his queen and his dedication moved her, and she made a surprising decision: she offered him her blade (see [Elizabeth-Gonathon: Unexpected Alliance](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-gonathon-g-top-2-right-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nOf course, a serious moment with Elizabeth wouldn’t be complete without her usual shenanigans with Nerissa. Today’s antics somehow managed to outshine even the chaos of the fifth day. They involved hexing, marriages, and…childbirth? (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: I'm Pregnant!](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-3-left-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAfter their mischief, Elizabeth refocused on the king’s words about preparation. Inspired, she came up with the idea to organize a tournament. It would be a chance for everyone to train, test, and hone their swordsmanship.\n\n<br>\n\n[Grand Tournament Announcement](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/5R01-igo4sM?si=-LygLwE24UrsPdEL&amp;start=2956)\n<br>\n\n\nShe reached out to those who weren’t present for the announcement. Her most amusing call was to Ina, which started as a [prank call](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=4264) but ended with Elizabeth being pranked in return.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWith about an hour left before the tournament began, Elizabeth decided to spend her time completing quests, gathering coins, and, naturally, poking fun at the \"worm queen\" [statue](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=3219). She also tried nudging Gonathon and his pearl’s relationship forward, at the same getting hit by [horses](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=5545) during her escapades. For Elizabeth, this day felt like a \"filler episode\"—a break after completing all the dungeons.\n<br>\n\nThe tournament proceeded, with Gonathon emerging as the champion. Frieda made it far, but her loss to Kiara left her [fuming](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=10272). Elizabeth, ever the instigator, awarded Frieda a [booby prize](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=10304)—a small consolation for her defeat (not that kind of booby, get your head out of the gutter)\n<br>\n\nAs the day came to an end, Elizabeth reflected on what felt like a lighthearted interlude in the grand scheme of things. Little did she know, beneath the surface of their actions and laughter, something terrible was brewing—a storm unlike anything they’d faced before.\n",

Jyonathan couldn’t help but feel grateful for having such a devoted companion.\n<br>\n\nLater, she teamed up with Kiara, Ina, and Frieda Adams Antoinette Senior to explore the Ancient Sewer Dungeon. The setting—a sewer—was unusual, but the adventurers were motivated by the promise of recovering more pieces of their lost memories at the end of the quest.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe dungeon’s challenges were unique, focusing on trivia and riddles about their journey so far. Questions revolved around previous dungeons, the memories recovered, and individuals like Mori Calliope, Gawr Gura, Ninomae Ina’nis, and Takanashi Kiara. Correct answers allowed them to proceed, while wrong answers brought [punishment](https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?feature=shared&t=4148).\n\n<br>\n\n\nThere was lore about the four girls and a tease if the fifth, described through multiple iterations: a blonde girl building machines in one account and playing video games in another. As they reached the dungeon’s end, the truth revealed itself.\n\n<br>\n\n[Number One Detective](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?feature=shared&t=5409)\n<br>\n\n\nJyonathan remembered everything now. Her name wasn’t Jyonathan—it was Amelia Watson, the brilliant detective and close friend of the four girls. The revelation felt like a burden lifted off her shoulders. Amelia had always been herself: mischievous, friendly, and curious. The rediscovery of her identity didn’t diminish her joy or the fun persona she’d embraced in this kingdom—it amplified it.\n\n<br>\n\n\nReturning to the kingdom, Amelia was greeted warmly by her companions, who congratulated her on reclaiming her memories. She resolved to continue being the lively, mischievous person she had grown into, cherishing her journey so far.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHowever, something nagged at her. Her \"chatterbox\" kept mentioning odd words: *“Husband,” “Gonathon,” “Pearl.”* The terms were foreign to her, but they seemed significant. \n\n<br>\n\n\nBefore she could make sense of it, a knight clad in orange approached her, congratulating her like the others. Amelia, likewise, thanked the knight for his generosity.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBut she didn't know who this knight was.\n\n<br>\n\n\nShe smiled at the knight, and asked,\n\n<br>\n\n\n*\"And you are?\"*\n\n<br>\n\n\n(see [Gonathon-Amelia Watson: A Knight's Tale](#edge:gonathon-g-ame-top-2-bottom-2))\n",

Still energized, the trio pressed forward to the Volcanic Dungeon, ready to face its fiery trials.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe Volcanic Dungeon lived up to its name. Lava flowed freely, fire burned everywhere, and each step seemed to trigger traps, sending the adventurers plummeting into the molten pools below. While frustrating, the dungeon held deeper meaning for Shakira. Every fall was followed by a rise, symbolizing rebirth and an unyielding will to persevere.\n\n<br>\n\n\nYet, the dungeon’s theme didn’t match the tone of its lore. The story unfolded around a knight with an obsession for burgers at a certain fast-food joint. It was oddly comedic amid the danger. At the dungeon’s climax, the group encountered a massive goddess-like statue surrounded by orbiting orbs that fired beams of fire. To defeat it, the adventurers had to leap across treacherous platforms to destroy the statue. It was a trial of patience and determination, but Shakira succeeded.\n\n<br>\n\n[Recovering memories of herself](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/3cr3DLpyB60?si=Kx0hG8yTKkUwMq1G&amp;start=7508)\n<br>\n\nThe truth was revealed: Shakira wasn’t her real name. She was *Takanashi Kiara*, the mighty phoenix knight. A leader of armies, a being of rebirth, and, oddly enough, a fast-food restaurant owner who once resurrected a failing burger chain. Kiara found the latter detail amusingly absurd compared to her grandeur but accepted it with grace.\n\n<br>\n\nWith the dungeons behind her, Kiara returned to the kingdom, eager to dive into its chaos. When she noticed Nerissa pushing an unwanted marriage onto Elizabeth, someone Kiara deeply cared for, she decided to intervene. Nerissa’s claim of being pregnant with Elizabeth’s child led Kiara to propose an utterly bizarre solution: having Nerissa [*“pee on redstone to see if it turned green.”*](https://www.youtube.com/live/3cr3DLpyB60?feature=shared&t=13378) It was nonsensical but effectively confused Nerissa.\n<br>\n\n\nThe absurdity didn’t stop there. Nerissa claimed a baby chicken as proof of her and Elizabeth’s child. At this, Kiara decided to end the charade. Drawing her sword, she cooked the baby chicken, literally, firmly putting an end to Nerissa’s antics. For good measure, Kiara also slayed Nerissa herself, brushing off the events as if nothing had happened (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: I'm Pregnant!](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-3-left-2))\n\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Kiara joined Jyonathan, Ina, and Frieda Adams Antoinette Senior in their conquest to the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*, and recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/3cr3DLpyB60?feature=shared&t=10767) of someone she held near and dear-*Amelia Watson* (though Kiara couldn't help but express her disappointment when her entire mythical existence had been reduced to a *borgur lady*).\n\n<br>\n\nTo cap off the day, she participated in Elizabeth’s tournament. The competition was fierce, with the final battle between her and Gonathon becoming an epic showdown. The stakes were high, and the outcome would determine the ultimate champion. However, winning was only part of the story, as Kiara's true intention for wanting victory was much more special (see [Kiara-Gonathon: The Oranges](#edge:kiara-gonathon-g-top-3-right-1))\n\n",

A heavy burden was lifted off her shoulders, leaving her free to focus on her primary objective: building her dream library. \n\n<br>\n\n\nHer vision for the library was clear. It would follow the theme of the Scarlet Wand, radiating elegance and mystique. Inspired by the impressive buildings in the kingdom—especially the monumental Tam Gandr statue Gonathon was constructing—Fauna decided to relocate her library to a more central and grand location. She wanted it to be a hub for knowledge and creativity, a place that stood out in the bustling kingdom.\n\n<br>\n\n\nConstruction began with Nerissa as her trusted assistant. Nerissa proved invaluable, tirelessly collecting materials, managing sales, and delivering the results back to Fauna. Despite her earlier missteps as an employee, Nerissa had always been there for Fauna, and her dedication didn’t go unnoticed. Fauna appreciated her efforts and companionship.\n<br>\n\n[Still the best employee](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/j4AxXzluEWE?feature=shared&t=831)\n<br>\n\n\nAfter a productive building session, it was time for the daily lottery pull! The winning number was [639](https://www.youtube.com/live/j4AxXzluEWE?feature=shared&t=7232), but, to everyone’s surprise, there were no winners this time. The jackpot rolled over, growing even larger and adding to the excitement for the next draw.\n\n<br>\n\n\nReturning to her project, Fauna laid out her plans for the library. It would be open to all books, including a special corner dedicated to fanfics. She envisioned it as a place where creativity could thrive, no matter the genre or style.\n\n<br>\n\n[Vision of the library](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/j4AxXzluEWE?feature=shared&t=10707)\n<br>\n\nThe Red-Hued Library stood tall, its three floors connected by an elegant spiral staircase, mirroring the distinctive shape of the Scarlet Wand’s hat from the outside. The ground floor housed an extensive collection of books, neatly arranged on towering mahogany shelves. The flooring, made of polished quartz, gleamed under the gentle glow of warm ambient lighting, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere—the perfect space for reading and quiet contemplation.\n<br>\n\nUnlike the others in the kingdom, Fauna’s day was relatively quiet and focused. While others dove into chaotic and often absurd shenanigans, Fauna regretted not getting involved in the action. However, she held onto the hope that more exciting adventures and interactions would come her way soon.\n\n<br>\n\nFor now, her library was her priority, and she poured her heart into every brick and shelf, confident that her vision would soon come to life.\n\n<br>\n\n\n[\"FaunaMart 1996 VHS Commercial Footage\" by Emico Otero](#out:https://x.com/EmicoOtero/status/1832447889794331060)",

A seemingly innocuous accessory, the hat resembled a stain, but this resemblance was no coincidence. It wasn’t just a symbol; it was alive. The stain atop her head began to take over her mind and actions. \n\n<br>\n\n[Princess of the Stains](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/8frv4avuyl8?si=1o2GsUu_IvpfxnZn&amp;start=217)\n<br>\n\nUnconsciously, Bijou started placing [corrupted blocks](https://www.youtube.com/live/8frv4avuyl8?feature=shared&t=456) within her guild's area. Each time, she gasped in shock, as though unaware of her actions. The corruption seemed to act on its own, spreading without her conscious intent. \n\n<br>\n\nShe claimed she was no longer Raora’s daughter nor a subject of Tam Gandr. She was the Stain Princess, the harbinger of ruin. With [Joe](https://www.youtube.com/live/8frv4avuyl8?feature=shared&t=519)’s influence, she vowed to set the kingdom ablaze and bring chaos to the lands.\n\n<br>\n\nFor now, her influence was too weak. She had to stay under the radar to avoid detection until she grew stronger. Bijou joined Kiara, Raora, Gonathon, and Nerissa in the Ancient Sewer Dungeon, masking her true intentions. However, her guildmate Gonathon, ever observant, noticed something was [amiss](https://www.youtube.com/live/8frv4avuyl8?feature=shared&t=4630). He confronted Bijou, asking her to remove her hat. Bijou deflected, blaming a \"full inventory\" for her refusal. Her clever evasion only deepened Gonathon's suspicions.\n\n<br>\n\n[Gonathon interrogates the Princess](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/8frv4avuyl8?si=VPQf-YeYUAdsZAnK&amp;start=4760)\n<br>\n\nLater, Bijou faced interrogation by Elizabeth and Gonathon regarding the defacing of the queen's statue. As the primary suspect—and rightly so—Bijou used her cunning to feign innocence. With tears and an air of vulnerability, she convinced them she wasn’t responsible.\n\n<br>\n\n[Mother I'm innocent D:](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8frv4avuyl8?feature=shared&t=5669)\n<br>\n\nHowever, the corruption’s presence was becoming harder to ignore. It occupied a corner of the Cerulean Cup area, its muddy blocks, withered trees, and ominous aura making it stand out. Signs with foreboding phrases like “Darkness is approaching” heightened the unease. As suspicions grew, Bijou made a bold move: she abruptly removed her hat. With a snap, her memories of the day vanished, leaving her seemingly innocent. Her clever gambit erased any doubt from the minds of her accusers.\n\n<br>\n\n[Good morning, what's happening?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/8frv4avuyl8?si=57u_j8ZXf4jtt8yu&amp;start=7379)\n<br>\n\n\nConsumed by evil—or perhaps just mischief—Bijou decided to [torment](https://www.youtube.com/live/8frv4avuyl8?feature=shared&t=11633) her sister Ina. She blasted Ina’s song, Violet, right next to her. Whether it was an act of malice or simply a prank, it unnerved the purple priestess. Later, Bijou and Ina had a heart-to-heart conversation. It was then that Bijou revealed the truth of her corruption (see [Bijou-Ina: Sisters](#edge:koseki-bijou-nino-ina-bottom-3-top-0)).\n<br>\n\n\nToward the end of the day, after participating in the tournament, Bijou confided in Frieda Adams Antoinette Senior. She unveiled her identity as the Stain Princess and shared her plans to take over the kingdom. To her delight, Frieda knelt before her, pledging loyalty and offering to aid in her conquest... but Bijou’s excitement was short-lived; Frieda quickly revealed she was tricking her. The owl lady declared her intention to defeat Bijou and become a hero herself.\n\n<br>\n\n[Finally, a comrad- oh](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/8frv4avuyl8?si=Vlk1EbKJ2xFYmWEm&amp;start=15193)\n<br>\n\nNonetheless, the seeds of chaos had been sown, and she would see her plans to fruition—no matter the cost.\n",

Such blasphemy!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/oygFzGlMT28?si=2KtGxfUiZWo9TRa6&amp;start=180)\n<br>\n\nBefore he could delve into the mystery, Gonathon joined Kiara, Raora, Nerissa, and Bijou to aid their expedition into the Ancient Sewer Dungeon. Along the way, most members expressed their loyalty and reverence for [Queen Tam](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=442), though Nerissa made a cheeky comment about how the statue’s depiction of Tam lacking a bit of \"cake\".\n\n<br>\n\n\nReturning to the kingdom, Gonathon resumed his investigation. Within his guild’s territory, he discovered something alarming—corrupted blocks had appeared in a corner of the land, accompanied by a sinister sign that read: [*\"May chaos take the world.\"*](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=1759) This discovery only deepened the mystery, and Gonathon began to piece together the puzzle.\n\n<br>\n\n\nGiven that only guild members could build on his land, suspicion naturally fell on his peers. Queen Tam was above reproach, and Ina wasn’t the type for such antics. This left two potential suspects: the Hot Pink One and Koseki Bijou. The latter’s behavior had been peculiar lately, and her hat—a strange, stain-like accessory—only added to Gonathon’s unease.\n\n<br>\n\n\nSeeking answers, Gonathon confronted Bijou and requested that she remove the hat to prove it was merely an accessory. To his frustration, Bijou refused, offering a litany of excuses that only fueled his suspicions.\n<br>\n\n[She's not taking it off](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/oygFzGlMT28?si=2KtGxfUiZWo9TRa6&amp;start=2475)\n<br>\n\n\nRealizing he couldn’t solve this alone, Gonathon reluctantly sought help from Elizabeth. Despite their occasional clashes, he knew she was resourceful and could aid in uncovering the truth (see [Gonathon-Elizabeth: Unexpected Alliance](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-gonathon-g-top-2-right-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe day was far from uneventful. Gonathon found himself embroiled in various occurrences, from witnessing the peculiar romance between Elizabeth and Nerissa to participating in an impromptu dueling tournament. Yet through it all, two traits of Gonathon shone brightly: his unwavering loyalty and his readiness to assist others.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHe helped Kiara [enchant](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=5674) her tools and mediated between Nerissa and Kiara after a dramatic incident involving the alleged “death” of Nerissa’s [child](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=4296). \n<br>\n\nBut his most profound devotion was reserved for two figures: his queen, Tam Gandr, for whom he would gladly defend against naysayers, and his wife, Jyonathan—the pearl of his life. Gonathon’s love for Jyonathan was so deep that he dreamt of erecting a statue in her honor beside Tam’s, a testament to his devotion and desire to make her happy. Yes, anything to make his beloved happy.\n<br>\n\n...\n<br>\n...\n\n<br>\n\nBack on his fourth day, Gonathon had feared that when his wife regained her memories as Amelia Watson, she would forget their shared life and love.  \n\n<br>\n\n\nThat fear became reality.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhen he greeted her later on, the blonde maiden had no recollection of her dear husband.\n<br>\n\n\nWith his queen on an expedition, his guildmate under suspicion of corruption, and his beloved lost to memory, Gonathon’s burdens were heavy. \n<br>\n\nYet, he resolved to press on, undeterred by the challenges before him (see [Gonathon-Amelia Watson: A Knight's Tale](#edge:gonathon-g-ame-top-2-bottom-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n[\"there is only one for him\" by Daaku](#out:https://x.com/koizumi_arata/status/1831971695621808324)",

There, they recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared&t=3719) of *Amelia Watson*, revealing that Jyonathan had been Amelia all along.\n\n<br>\n\n\nUpon returning to the kingdom, Ina encountered Gonathon, who sought her insight regarding his wife. He asked if Amelia, after regaining her memories, had mentioned him. Just as Ina began to respond, a tune filled the air—a familiar one emanating from the Moai statue. It was her own voice from the past, and the sound was too much for the purple priestess, and she fled the scene.\n<br>\n\n[Aghghg yamero!!!!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared&t=4244)\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Ina’s mischievous streak resurfaced as she stumbled upon a conversation between Elizabeth and Bijou. Bijou had been acting strangely, and though Ina was concerned for her sister, the moment was too tempting to resist. Channelling her inner cicada, Ina began making noises to prank the duo.\n<br>\n\n[*Cicada noises*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zaM1QIff9U?si=MTxcQMh-nLtocBcE&amp;start=4520)\n<br>\n\nAfterward, Ina confronted Bijou directly. What she discovered was chilling: Bijou wasn’t just acting odd; she had become corrupted (see Ina-Bijou: Corrupted for details). This revelation weighed heavily on Ina’s heart. She knew she needed to act but decided to hold off until she could investigate further (see [Bijou-Ina: Sisters](#edge:koseki-bijou-nino-ina-bottom-3-top-0)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe tournament awaited, and Ina participated in the duels. Though she was defeated by Gonathon, she remained proud of her guildmate, who advanced to [victory](https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared&t=7150). Still, her joy was tempered by the somber reality of Gonathon’s struggles. His wife, Amelia, had [forgotten him](https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared&t=7730). Despite this, Gonathon focused on a greater threat—Bijou, or as she now called herself, the *Stain Princess*, who was believed to be possessed by a sinister force.\n\n<br>\n\n\nIna knew she couldn’t stand idly by. Though she resolved to stop her sister if it came to that, she also recalled an ancient tale of a golden apple said to cure corruption. It was a faint glimmer of hope, but Ina clung to it. She would do whatever it took to find the apple and save her sister.\n",

            "content": "The love story between Gonathon and Jyonathan was a sweet one. From enemies accusing each other of being crazy to lovers who couldn’t leave each other’s side for even a second, they constantly bantered, teased, and doted on each other—forever the lovey-doveys. And on this day, things would be no different, as they continued their antics.\n\n<br>\n\nAt the start of the day, Jyonathan (accidentally) saved her husband from being trapped by Elizabeth. The blonde heard his cry for help and acted immediately, instinctively protecting him. \n<br>\n\n[Thank you my Pearl!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?feature=shared&t=238)\n<br>\n\nLater, Gonathon pulled his wife aside for a private conversation regarding the strange behaviors of various members, specifically Koseki Bijou, whom he suspected had a living Stain controlling her mind. Jyonathan agreed and took it upon herself to investigate the [situation](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=4034). \n<br>\n\nThe two were determined to figure things out, trying to talk to Bijou, questioning her, even asking her to take off her hat, but the more they sought answers, the more confusing the situation [became](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=4887). They decided to set it aside for now.\n<br>\n\nThroughout all this, it was clear how close the two were. They cared for each other, watched each other’s backs, and always helped whenever one needed anything. It was a beautiful relationship, and moments like these reminded Gonathon how grateful he was to have such a companion. He was loyal to his queen, but he did not wish to abandon his Pearl either.\n<br>\n\n\n[Anything for you, my Pearl](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=4987)\n<br>\n\nAs he reminisced about how crazy the journey had been, he thought about writing a [book](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=7660)—a book about the people he’d met, the adventures he’d gone on, and most importantly, his beloved. A book about how he hoped everything would stay the same.\n\n<br>\n\nA book about how he wished things would never change.\n<br>\n...\n<br>\nJyonathan went on to complete the final dungeon, and from that conquest, she remembered who she was. \n<br>\nHer name wasn’t Jyonathan, nor was she some lunatic who wanted to kill the king. She was Amelia Watson, the number one detective. She remembered everything—her past friends, her accomplishments, her legacy, everything that made her the person she was. \n<br>\nBut in return, she forgot something, or rather, someone, someone near and dear to her. A tradeoff many would deem cruel.\n<br>\n\n[And you are?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?feature=shared&t=5989)\n<br>\n\nAmelia had forgotten about her dear husband, Gonathon. \n<br>\nThe revelation stunned the knight, but only for a mere moment. He had expected such an outcome the day before. And so, instead of breaking down, instead of grieving, instead of bawling his eyes out, Gonathon stood firm and wished Amelia the best in her endeavors. He saw it as the right thing to do, to let her go her own way and not force her to stay where she no longer belonged.\n<br>\n\nIt was a powerful moment, and with his emotions heavy, Gonathon made his decision. He would write the book he had been meaning to write.\n<br>\n\n[A Knight's Tale](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=9754)\n<br>\n\nLater on, during the tournament, something peculiar happened. \n<br>\n\nWhile watching the duels, something stirred within Amelia—something about the way Gonathon fought, his might, his will, his determination for victory. It faintly reminded her of something she had lost, something she had [forgotten](https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?feature=shared&t=8801). Others noticed it and tried to push the recollection [further](https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?feature=shared&t=9236).\n<br>\n\nAt one point, Amelia remembered a diamond, but it was still too foggy. Her head hurt, and she struggled to grasp what it was she was trying to recall. It was important, she felt, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t remember. \n<br>\nAmelia decided it would be best to rest for now, yet that aching in her head [persisted](https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?feature=shared&t=9730).\n<br>\n\n[A Knight's Tale by Raff Yasushi](#out:https://x.com/raffanda_/status/1832103922015822089)\n<br>\n\n[Gonathon G! by yomosaka](#out:https://x.com/yomosaka/status/1832146121898221666)\n<br>\n\n[\"Memories\" by SirTro](#out:https://x.com/sir_tro/status/1832092670191349947)\n<br>\n\n[\"A Knight's Tale illustrated\" by Namii](#out:https://x.com/NAMIORII/status/1832844940021514601)\n<br>\n\n[\"Welcome back, Myth\" by nekotj](#out:https://x.com/NekoNyanTJ/status/1832093407843672251)\n",

            "content": "Nerissa got cooked. Literally. How it happened wasn’t all that important—what mattered was the ridiculous series of events that led up to it.\n<br>\n\nNerissa had long been accused of being a witch, mostly by Elizabeth, and everyone knew it. But when the blue maiden somehow knew details about conversations Elizabeth had with others without even being there, the red knight’s suspicions only grew stronger. Their usual back-and-forth escalated, as it often did, until things took a very bizarre turn.\n<br>\n\n[Preganante](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=2456)\n<br>\n\nSomehow, Nerissa ended up \"pregnant\" with Elizabeth’s child. To prove it, she cracked open a chicken egg, and, sure enough, a chick popped out. She used this as undeniable evidence, insisting that Elizabeth had to take responsibility. She clung to the scarlet knight, pestering her nonstop, just to grab her attention.\n<br>\n\nKiara, who had been standing by, watching the absurdity unfold, clearly wasn’t having any of it. Tired of Nerissa’s nonsense, she simply unsheathed her sword, swung it down, and cooked the \"child\" on the spot.\n<br>\n\nHorrified, Nerissa ran off to report the heinous crime to the others, accusing Kiara of murder. She argued that, as a bird, of course she would lay eggs, and therefore, her child was legitimate. She demanded that Kiara be put on trial, that justice be served, and that reparations be made.\n\n<br>\n\nSo, Kiara cooked Nerissa [too](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=2898).\n<br>\n\nElizabeth, for her part, didn’t think much of it. That was, until she got a call from [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=4894). \"Nerissa’s dead,\" he told her. \"She’s a ghost now.\" Startled, she immediately dialed Nerissa’s number, and sure enough, the blue maiden—now ghostly—answered.\n<br>\n\n[Nerissa is kil](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=4984)\n<br>\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" Ghost Nerissa spoke solemnly, \"avenge me. Slay Kiara in my name.\" (slightly overdramatized)\n\nElizabeth hesitated. For a moment, she actually considered it. Kiara had quite literally roasted someone alive—justice seemed warranted.\n<br>\n\nBut then she saw Kiara, absolutely glowing with excitement about her upcoming tournament. And just like that, she abandoned the whole vengeance idea entirely.\n<br>\n\n[Tough luck, Nerissa.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=7493)\n<br>\n\n[\"Maybe if I die with a knight's honor, I may see her again\" by Keisea](#out:https://x.com/Keiseeaaa/status/1832145708394410335)\n<br>\n\n[\"i will be a better knight for you, lady ravencroft\" by mitchie](#out:https://x.com/pappikapon/status/1832185189864239450)\n",

            "content": "Gonathon was determined to find out the culprit that had defaced the queen's statue, but seeing how it might be difficult to do it alone, he decided to ask for help. He reached out to someone that he had not really had a good impresssion with, considering the various mental damage she'd caused him on the first day, as well as her spitefulness for his queen Tam Gandr, but she was the only person he saw capable and trustworthy for something like this\n<br>\n\nAt first, she didn’t pick up (and left quite an funny [voicemail](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=2527)), but a little later, the red maiden, Elizabeth, called him [back](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=1092). They met up at Mori’s Tavern, where Gonathon explained his situation and proposed setting their differences aside to uncover the truth. Elizabeth wanted more details, and when she was shown an image of the defacement, she was baffled.\n<br>\n\n[Oh god the humanity!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=1257)\n<br>\n\nSeeing how bad it was, Elizabeth agreed to [assist](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=1407) Gonathon. Their primary suspect was Koseki Bijou, and so the two brought her to the tavern for interrogation. Their reasoning was simple—only those within Gonathon’s guild could have modified or changed anything about the statue, and Bijou was his guildmate.\n\n<br>\n\nElizabeth, being the strict knight and motherly figure that she was, didn’t relent in her questioning.\n\n<br>\n\n[\"DID YOU DO IT? DID YOU???\"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=1871)\n<br>\n\nThe princess, however, rejected the accusation outright, and Elizabeth even turned her interrogation on Gonathon [himself](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=2011). Of course, why would he do such a thing?\n<br>\n\nThen, an offhand remark was made about Elizabeth possibly being hexed by Nerissa, the “witch,” hinting that she wasn’t as uptight as she let on. Gonathon’s trust in the knight wavered, and, feeling betrayed, he stormed out of the [tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=2066). Well, so much for alliances.\n<br>\n\nIt was mostly an overreaction, though. The two of them did, in fact, trust each other—Gonathon respected Elizabeth’s willingness to help others, and Elizabeth, in return, respected the orange knight for his unwavering loyalty to his beloveds.\n<br>\n\nLater, when Elizabeth learned that Gonathon’s wife had forgotten about him, she approached him, asking if he was okay and offering her [condolences](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=9171).\n<br>\n\nTruly an unexpected alliance.",

She wanted to find its source, to put an end to it before it got out of hand—but she didn’t have to search for long. The source came to her.\n<br>\n\n[Wooden shovel...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared&t=4688)\n<br>\n\nKoseki Bijou, Ina’s own sister, approached her with a confession. It was she who had been spreading the corruption, and in doing so, she had come to the realization that she was the Stain Princess. With unwavering conviction, Bijou urged Ina to join her, to stand by her side, and together, they would plunge the kingdom into darkness.\n<br>\n\nIna was stunned. Shocked that her own sister—her sweet, innocent Bijou—would say such things. No, this wasn’t her sister speaking. It couldn’t be. Something—no, someone—must have tainted her, twisted her mind, made her believe such nonsense. But whether she was being controlled or not, the corruption had to be stopped before it was too late. And if it came down to it, if there was no other way… Ina swore she would not hesitate to bring her own sister down.\n<br>\n\nShe took out her anger on the creeping [stains](https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared&t=5066), destroying them as if doing so would somehow free Bijou from their grasp. But no amount of venting could bring her sister back. Ina needed a plan.\n<br>\n\nShe sought counsel from two of her fellow heroes, Gonathon and Kiara, explaining the dire [situation](https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared&t=7676). Their primary goal would be to sever the connection between Bijou and the Stain’s influence. Kiara, ever direct, suggested a drastic measure—beheading Bijou outright. But Ina refused to believe that was the only way.\n<br>\n\nThen, she remembered something—a tale of a legendary golden apple, said to possess the power to purge corruption. If she could obtain it, she could disguise its effects in a drink and trick Bijou into consuming it. A milkshake, perhaps. After all, Ina had learned that Bijou loved milkshakes.\n<br>\n\n[Do you perhaps like milkshake?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared&t=8028)\n<br>\n\nWith a newfound sense of determination, Ina steeled herself for the coming days.

Right from its grand opening, the store made a name for itself, drawing in a crowd with its unique business ideals and quickly establishing itself as a worthy competitor.\n<br>\n\n[NanaEleven's venue](#image:images-opt/nanaeleven.webp)\n<br>\n\nMeanwhile, Nerissa, after being cooked by Kiara the day before, found herself in an unexpected predicament—she had become a ghost. However, during her brief time in the afterlife, she stumbled upon many hidden secrets lurking within the kingdom, further fueling her suspicions of the king. Eventually, she was revived, but the knowledge she had gained in her spectral state left her with more questions than answers.\n<br>\n\nTwo more minigames made their debut on this day. The Scarlet Wand Guild introduced a memory game, while the Cerulean Cup Guild launched a chicken-catching game. Naturally, the games sparked competition among the girls, with NanaMoo taking things very seriously when it came to the memory game.\n<br>\n\nThen came an unexpected twist. Raora, also known as Queen Mario, had a sudden realization—perhaps the tension she had with Tam wasn’t hatred after all. Maybe, just maybe, Tam was actually in love with her. And so, in a shocking turn of events, Raora proposed to Tam.\n<br>\n\n[Mario's proposal to Tam](#image:images-opt/marry.webp)\n<br>\n\nFinally, Bijou’s plan to take over the kingdom fully throttled forward—or as she preferred to call it, \"spreading the corruption.\" She spent the entire day becoming an absolute menace to those around her, slowly but surely corrupting others into joining her cause.

            "content": "Fuwawa had been diligently preparing for the final day, as she always had since the beginning. Her dependable nature had never wavered—she did what needed to be done, avoided causing trouble, and won the hearts of everyone she met. She was, in many ways, the ideal hero, in contrast to her pink counterpart, who was often a source of chaos. Still, Mococo’s antics had their own charm, and Fuwawa couldn’t deny that her partner was a good doggo at heart.\n\n<br>\n\nWhile gathering materials, Fuwawa took a moment to reflect on the kingdom of Libestal. Despite the occasional need to slay enemies and the myriad shenanigans other heroes engaged in, the kingdom seemed [peaceful](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=2085) overall. The challenges they faced often felt more like lighthearted adventures than real threats.\n\n<br>\n\nShe spent some time exploring the kingdom, admiring its latest developments, including the newly opened *NanaEleven* and the completed statue of the [queen](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=2133). Fuwawa marveled at the accomplishments of her fellow heroes.\n\n<br>\n\nWith plenty of time before the final day arrived, Fuwawa turned to a newfound passion: caring for Elizabeth’s chickens. As mentioned on day six, Fuwawa had been seeking something to nurture, and these chickens were the perfect companions. She adored their cuteness and tended to them lovingly in her small coop. Her eyes sparkled with joy whenever they laid eggs, and she fed them every seed she could find. It was a simple yet blissful routine that brought her immense happiness.\n\n<br>\n\n[They're so cute](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=9083)\n<br>\n\nHowever, her joy was short-lived. After venturing out to gather materials, Fuwawa returned to find her coop empty. All the chickens were gone—vanished without a trace. Not even a feather remained. Confusion and panic set in as she considered the possibilities. Had they flown away? Escaped? Both seemed unlikely. This left her with a more troubling thought: someone had *done* something to them.\n\n<br>\n\n[What happened to my chickens...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdQoGFICNDk?si=k3FnLH85iZl-cZKz&amp;start=11103)\n<br>\n\nHer mind turned to Mococo, the fuzzy one's recent string of questionable actions made her a suspect. But with no evidence, Fuwawa couldn’t be sure. Saddened by the loss, she let out a heart-wrenching bau bau that could tug at anyone’s heartstrings.\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nFuwawa reported the incident to [Gonathon and Raora](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=11569). Overcome with sadness and frustration, she [lashed out](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=11633) at Raora, suspecting the big cat for having eaten all the chickens. This outburst was uncharacteristic of Fuwawa, who was typically gentle and composed. However, Raora assured her that she wasn’t responsible and, to help ease her sorrow, gifted her some chicken eggs to start anew. Grateful, Fuwawa accepted the eggs and began hatching a new brood.\n\n<br>\n\n\nFeeling somewhat better, Fuwawa returned to her preparations. A brief moment of levity came when Mococo, having won big at the casino, celebrated so enthusiastically that her cheers echoed throughout the kingdom, reaching Fuwawa’s ears.\n\n<br>\n\n[A disturbance in the force](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdQoGFICNDk?si=hLhOJsA0QC7bKCkW&amp;start=12521)\n<br>\n\nBut her relief didn’t last long. Not long after, Fuwawa discovered her chickens missing [once again](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=13177). Something was definitely amiss. Seeking answers, she approached [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=13459), who revealed that he had a suspicion about the culprit. Someone corrupted was targeting her chickens, he warned. He urged Fuwawa to be cautious and to avoid accepting hats from anyone—especially Mococo, who might already be under the influence of corruption.\n\n<br>\n\n[Bijou? What's wrong?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=14707)\n<br>\n\nFuwawa barely had time to process Gonathon’s warning before she was confronted by Bijou, the source of the spreading corruption. The gem maiden was a terrifying sight, exuding an aura of menace that set off every alarm in Fuwawa’s instincts. Even a single glance at Bijou was enough to send her fleeing in fear.\n<br>\n\n[Oh gosh! Goodbye](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=15903)\n<br>\n\nFuwawa’s once-peaceful view of Libestal began to crumble. Her chickens were gone, the corruption was spreading, and even her closest companion, Mococo, might not be trustworthy. For the first time, Fuwawa felt a deep, foreboding fear for what awaited on the final day.\n<br>\n\n[\"Memory fragments\" by fukuinu](#out:https://x.com/fukuinu_daddy/status/1832892608789770703)",

            "content": "Now free of her past crimes, Mococo felt a newfound sense of liberation. No longer did she have to worry about being chased on horseback or threatened with the gallows. Life was great—though she was officially banned from FaunaMart.\n<br>\n\n\nEarly in the day, Mococo crossed paths with her (not so) trusty lawyer, Cecilia, who had defended her during the infamous lottery shenanigans a day or two ago. Truth be told, Mococo wasn’t entirely convinced of Cecilia’s competence. The green-haired, self-proclaimed lawyer boasted a supposed 99.8% success rate in court, but her examples often seemed like improvised nonsense. Her credibility wasn’t helped by the fact that she’d threatened Mococo with a sword. All in all, the experience was a solid 3/10.\n<br>\n\n[Some lawyer that was](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=602)\n<br>\n\nLater, Mococo decided to check out NanaEleven, the newly opened rival to FaunaMart. Initially skeptical, given her less-than-stellar history with convenience stores, her doubts melted away upon discovering the superior services NanaEleven offered. The prices were reasonable (everything was free), and the lottery system was refreshingly fair, with a guaranteed win rate of 100%. This time, Mococo kept her cool and purchased only [five lottery tickets](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=6668).\n<br>\n\n\nHowever, her patience wore thin while waiting for the winning [announcements](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=7640), as the crowd’s attention kept shifting to Gonathon’s peculiar pregnancy situation. Despite the delay, Mococo eventually claimed her prize: 500 coins. Overall, an 8/10 experience—less waiting time would’ve been ideal, but the thought of NanaEleven eclipsing FaunaMart was deeply amusing.\n<br>\n\n\nDetermined to prepare for the final day, Mococo spent much of her time gathering materials and earning money by mass-producing potato salads. Her efforts paid off, and with over 10,000 coins in her pocket, she headed to the casino to test her luck. After a series of losses, her persistence paid off with a big win, leaving her triumphant.\n\n<br>\n\n[YEAAAAAHHH!!!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFnAgJtQtiY?si=fPjknD7-XvO5KP6U&amp;start=12471)\n<br>\n\nHer jolly day would only last for so long, however. Later in the day, Mococo received a panicked call from Fuwawa. The fluffy one’s beloved chickens had [vanished](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=11111), leaving her distressed and inconsolable. Seeing her companion in such a state, Mococo grew concerned and resolved to investigate. Her first theory? [FaunaMart](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=11362). She speculated, with little evidence, that they might have kidnapped the chickens to turn them into lottery tickets. A ridiculous notion, perhaps, but worth considering.\n<br>\n\n\nAs the mystery deepened, Mococo stumbled upon the answer herself. While wandering near the Cerulean Cup, her curiosity led her to a dark, ominous corner of the area. The ground was scorched, littered with withered bushes, strange stains, and patches of fire. Unwittingly, Mococo stepped on one of the rotten blocks, [injuring herself](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=12650). Gonathon, who happened to be nearby, swiftly pulled her out of harm’s way and urged her to cleanse herself in the queen’s holy water to rid herself of corruption. Whether Gonathon was bluffing or not, the fear Mococo felt in that place was all too real.\n<br>\n\nShortly after, Bijou appeared. The gem maiden said nothing, merely handing Mococo a peculiar purple hat shaped like a Stain. Unaware of its true nature, Mococo thought it was just an accessory and put it on. But almost immediately, she felt strange. A sinister voice whispered into her mind, commanding her with chilling simplicity: *“The chickens are tasty.”*\n<br>\n\nWhat happened next was a blur.\n\n<br>\n\n[B̶̢̫̝̖̗̘̹̩͇̦̱̳͈̯̮̋̉̀̀Ȃ̵͉͇̰͓̝̩̙͍̼̒̋ͅǗ̶̗̇͌̋ ̷̨̝̲̱͂͛̄̃͑̈́̋̏̚͝B̶̢̨͚̬͕͔̟̻͓͍̬̝̠̉̏́̏̍̊̄̇̀̐̀́̚͝A̸̛̞͚̪͕͙͎̒̏͂̍̍́͋͝U̴̲͇̗͈͑̒̄͛̓̓͌̅̄̔̚](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFnAgJtQtiY?si=I8pw4o1eeG_aDK5a&amp;start=12974)\n\n<br>\n\nWhen Mococo regained [her senses](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=13135), it felt as though she’d just woken from a deep sleep. She couldn’t recall why there was a hat in her inventory or why her claws were bloodstained. When Fuwawa tearfully confronted her about the missing chickens, Mococo had [no answers](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=13238).\n<br>\n\nThe situation escalated when Bijou cornered Fuwawa. Mococo instinctively stepped in to [protect](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=14838) her fluffy counterpart, distracting Bijou long enough for Fuwawa to escape. Their plan worked, and the two managed to flee.\n<br>\n\nTo ensure their safety, Mococo built a small shelter for the two of them to hide in, preparing for whatever danger lay ahead.",

It lingered in her mind like an unfulfilled promise, shaping her actions and ideals as a knight. But why did it resonate so deeply? Perhaps it was her duty to uphold justice, to shield the kingdom from evil. Or perhaps it was something more personal—a connection she had yet to fully understand. Regardless of the reason, Elizabeth resolved to honor her purpose by serving the king and protecting the people, even as the shadow of impending doom loomed large.\n\n<br>\n\n[*Justice(n): the quality of being just](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gw0dZbPKTG4?si=2V7sePWgWbYocBpb&amp;start=322)\n\n<br>\n\nThe seventh day, the final day before disaster struck, began with unease. Elizabeth awoke feeling unrested, burdened by a restless night haunted by thoughts of Nerissa. Despite their quarrelsome interactions, Elizabeth felt an inexplicable connection to the raven-haired woman, whom she had previously accused of witchcraft. Nerissa's death weighed heavily on her, yet hope lingered—magic existed in the kingdom, and perhaps there was a way to bring her back.\n<br>\n\n[She's gone huh...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=823)\n<br>\n\nDetermined to prepare for the storm that the king had ominously foretold, Elizabeth ventured out early. The kingdom was quiet, its inhabitants still stirring from sleep, giving her the solitude to reflect and steel herself for what was to come.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs she wandered the kingdom, Elizabeth came across the massive Tam Gandr statue completed by Gonathon. Though her disdain for the blue \"queen\" Tam Gandr had not waned, she admired the craftsmanship and the loyalty it represented. Despite her lingering spite, Elizabeth couldn’t deny the respect she held for Gonathon's dedication to [his queen](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=958).\n\n<br>\n\n\nSpotting a few early risers, Elizabeth decided to add some liveliness to her day by pranking Cecilia. However, her plans backfired when Cecilia turned the tables on her, catching Elizabeth off guard (this wasn't the first time Elizabeth had done a failed prank),\n\n<br>\n\n[Digital Millennium Copyright Act](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gw0dZbPKTG4?si=1KlntTFohlr2YxvR&amp;start=1128)\n<br>\n\nElizabeth then joined Cecilia at the newly opened memory game hosted by the Scarlet Wand guild. Unsurprisingly, Elizabeth, more skilled with a sword than strategy games, lost to Cecilia. Yet, during their time together, Elizabeth found herself inexplicably drawn to the green maiden. Something in Cecilia’s eyes—honor, loyalty, and faithfulness—spoke to Elizabeth, as if they shared a deeper connection from another life. Trusting her instincts, Elizabeth formed a positive impression of her newfound [companion](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=1784).\n\n<br>\n\n\nPreparing for the looming storm required resources, and Elizabeth was woefully short on funds. With no other choice, she turned to the kingdom's most peculiar money-making strategy: mass-producing potato salad. Though skeptical at first, she soon found the method to be wildly profitable, earning more than she had since arriving in the [kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=3511).\n\n<br>\n\n\nBetween making potato salad and working on her dungeon, Elizabeth found herself in a witty exchange with Frieda—still known by that name at the time, before becoming Nanamoo. The two bantered as Elizabeth teased Frieda about the strange messages she had been sending throughout the kingdom. The playful exchange took a turn when Frieda startled Elizabeth by seemingly reading her thoughts, leaving Elizabeth convinced that Frieda, too, must be a witch.\n\n<br>\n\n[Cool story, bro'eth](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gw0dZbPKTG4?si=cA0gf-Db4X7n3e7_&amp;start=2932)\n<br>\n\nTheir banter continued briefly before Elizabeth returned to her tasks. She took up an unusual hobby: building a small chicken coop and raising [chickens](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=4713). Though it seemed an odd pastime for a knight, Elizabeth approached it with surprising passion. She spoke to the chickens as if they were beloved pets and grew visibly excited whenever one laid an egg (perhaps a little too excited).\n<br>\n\n\n[The knight and her chickens](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gw0dZbPKTG4?si=JZ552VgIhxtkwVfD&amp;start=5618)\n<br>\n\nLater, Elizabeth had another brief interaction with Cecilia and Frieda, with the latter continuing to tease her about being a [distraction](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=7509). \n<br>\n\nFinally, Elizabeth called it a day. The calm before the storm hung heavy in the air, marking perhaps the most peaceful day she had experienced in some time. Yet she knew she must not lower her guard. The red knight had to be ready for the oncoming calamity.",

Other pressing matters called her away, preventing her from standing alongside her comrades in the climactic fight. The thought saddened the orange maiden, but she resolved to spend her remaining time in the kingdom to its fullest, holding her head high.\n\n<br>\n\nKiara approached her last day with no clear plan, deciding instead to let events unfold naturally. Her first interaction of the day was with Gonathon, a figure she had longed to have by her side but ultimately could not. Gonathon’s heart belonged to another, and Kiara respected his loyalty. As loyal servants to their queen, Tam Gandr, the two found camaraderie in their shared dedication. Together, they had always worked to safeguard the kingdom in their queen’s absence.\n<br>\n\n[Standing before the queen](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/lNIoudshEkQ?feature=shared&t=1468)\n<br>\nLater, Nerissa, whose life Kiara had taken the day before, returned seeking vengeance. However, with Gonathon acting as a mediator, tensions were eased, and a compromise was reached. Kiara, being a phoenix, agreed to assist in Nerissa's [revival](https://www.youtube.com/live/lNIoudshEkQ?feature=shared&t=4051).\n\n<br>\n\nOn her return to the kingdom, Kiara received an urgent call from Nerissa. Bijou, the corrupted princess, was wreaking havoc in the kingdom's garden, destroying crops in a chaotic rampage. \n<br>\n\n[Princess! You must not!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/lNIoudshEkQ?si=ajv6J5vhEfVVJG5M&amp;start=4343)\n\n<br>\n\nKiara and Nerissa tried to stop her, but their efforts were in vain. Bijou eventually left, leaving the garden in shambles and a heavy sense of loss in her wake.\n<br>\n\n\nLater in the day, Kiara stopped by the newly opened NanaEleven convenience store. Despite her complicated history with lotteries and her strained relationship with her former guildmate, Kiara found herself [supporting](https://www.youtube.com/live/lNIoudshEkQ?feature=shared&t=6907) the store’s lottery system to humor her friend. It was a simple act of goodwill, a gesture that spoke to her forgiving nature.\n\n<br>\n\nKiara also participated in a lighthearted memory game with other heroes and got swept up in an impromptu [\"male pregnancy\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/lNIoudshEkQ?feature=shared&t=8231) arc involving rumors of Gonathon’s supposed pregnancy. It was all in good fun, a humorous distraction amidst the weighty events of the day.\n\n<br>\n\nAs the day drew to a close, it was time for Kiara to bid her farewells. Her time in the kingdom had been nothing short of extraordinary. From saving ~~Lesbians~~ Lebestians (I will run this joke to the ground if I have to) and forming unbreakable bonds to serving queens, exposing lottery scams, recovering long-lost memories of owning a fast-food chain in a fiery dungeon, and engaging in countless shenanigans—including the murder of a raven-haired rival—her journey was as chaotic as it was fulfilling. Each memory, no matter how absurd or poignant, was a treasure she wouldn’t trade for the world.\n<br>\n\nWith a solemn bow before Tam Gandr’s statue, Kiara whispered her goodbyes. The kingdom of Libestal had left its mark on her, as she had on it. For now, her story in this realm had come to an end, but the memories would stay with her forever.\n<br>\n\n[Best of luck to everyone](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/lNIoudshEkQ?feature=shared&t=8978)\n<br>\n\n[Kiara by KeiMyon](#out:https://x.com/kei_myon/status/1831699644038181321)",

(see [Mario-Tam Gandr: Enemies To Lovers](#edge:raora-panthera-tam-gandr-right-2-top-1)). \n\n<br>\n\n\nWell, that was quite the way to kick off the day.

She tried her hand at the newly introduced chicken-catching [minigame](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rd0awHHBTiA?feature=shared&t=6336), explored the recently opened [NanaEleven](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rd0awHHBTiA?feature=shared&t=7390), gathered materials for the looming final day, and spent quality time with her friends. Despite the foreboding sense of impending doom that hung over the kingdom, the atmosphere was surprisingly cheerful, offering Mario a brief reprieve from her worries.\n",

            "content": "Although Cleopetra/Darwin/Napoleon/Frieda—her name was always a mystery—hadn’t been seen in the kingdom for a while, she had been quietly working on something monumental. Before she “started her vlog” on day seven, both Elizabeth and Cecilia noticed her unwavering diligence. She was so focused that she tolerated no distractions (see [Elizabeth's Point of View](#node:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhen the time was right, she launched her vlog with great excitement. It was a pivotal day for the girl in brown, one where she would unveil something that would change her life—and the lives of the kingdom's dwellers—for the better*. However, her big announcement was briefly delayed when she stumbled across Kiara, who sought a heartfelt conversation about their bond as Amber Coin members. \n<br>\n\nUnfortunately, the two were caught snooping around FaunaMart by Cecilia. In typical fashion, the girl in brown threw her guildmate under the bus without hesitation.\n<br>\n\n[Get out! You heathen!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zPJ78C7uNq8?feature=shared&t=360)\n<br>\n\nWith distractions out of the way, it was finally time for her big reveal. She proudly announced her secret project: the grand opening of *NanaEleven*, her very own convenience store.\n<br>\n\n[Welcome to NanaEleven!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/zPJ78C7uNq8?si=mqiviMof_FRuC4tu&amp;start=605)\n<br>\n\nNanaEleven was established as a rival to FaunaMart, though its stated goal was to “help” the existing store. She explained that FaunaMart’s location wasn’t ideal—it lacked interesting attractions (despite being near a giant statue, a gallows, and a castle). NanaEleven, she claimed, was designed as an outlet mall with ample parking, sure to draw more visitors and spark consumerism.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe store’s grand opening was an immediate success, attracting curious onlookers. NanaEleven explained its offerings:\n\n1. The store sold the juiciest berries and finest meats. Basic items, but here’s the twist—they were all free.\n2. Its main attraction was the lottery. Unlike FaunaMart’s luck-based system, NanaEleven’s lottery guaranteed fixed prizes of 100 coins each. The winners? The first 20 customers who purchased tickets! (There were only 19 people in the kingdom).\n<br>\n\nDespite its seemingly altruistic nature, the lottery tickets contained a hidden element that our shop owner did not disclose.\n<br>\n\n\nSpeaking of names, the entrepreneur asked Cecilia, her first customer, to give her a fitting title. Cecilia christened her “Nanamoo,” a name the owl girl immediately adored for its catchy ring. Thus, Nanamoo was born. The pair unexpectedly bonded over their business dealings, forming an unusual friendship (see [Nanamoo-Cecilia: Friends From Business](#edge:moom-cecilia-immergreen-bottom-0-left-1)).\n<br>\n\n\nAbout an hour after distributing her free lottery tickets, it was time to announce the winners. Unsurprisingly, everyone [won](https://www.youtube.com/live/zPJ78C7uNq8?feature=shared&t=6391). During the celebration, Nanamoo made a cheeky remark about Gonathon looking [pregnant](https://www.youtube.com/live/zPJ78C7uNq8?feature=shared&t=6241), which snowballed into an entire side story (see [Gonathon’s Point of View](#node:gonathon-g)).\n<br>\n\n\nThough NanaEleven had just opened, it had already made an impact—albeit with a financial loss of 1,000 coins. Despite the apparent success and charm of Nanamoo’s new venture, there was something hidden behind her cheerful smile. Only time would reveal her true intentions.\n<br>\n\n[They'll never see it coming](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/zPJ78C7uNq8?si=AOTB6BRlzqAsVuef&amp;start=5592)\n<br>\n\n[\"Nana-11 1996 VHS Commercial Footage\" by Emico Otero](#out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyw49svSeMw)",

            "content": "\nCecilia began the day with a focused yet questionable plan: she aimed to control the princess and use her as a puppet to rule the kingdom. Though many dismissed her as delusional, they humored her intentions, allowing her to proceed with her schemes. To ensure the success of her plan, Cecilia resolved to strengthen her relationships with others—not out of altruism, but to strategically \"leech\" their resources and support when needed.\n\n<br>\n\n\nEarly on, Cecilia met with Mococo, her client from the prior day’s chaotic lawsuit. Mococo's skepticism about Cecilia’s competency as an attorney was palpable. In an attempt to impress her client, Cecilia exaggerated her past successes, which only served to undermine her credibility further. \n<br>\n\n[99% winning cases](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/iAYrdIlfVf0?t=610)\n<br>\n\nCecilia then encountered Mario, who was equally unconvinced of her abilities, this time in her role as a knight. It seemed skepticism followed her in every role she undertook. Their conversation touched on these doubts, all while they intruded into the Cerulean Cup guild base. The interaction left much unresolved but solidified the doubts surrounding Cecilia's effectiveness in her many ventures.\n<br>\n\n[I'm quite the professional](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/iAYrdIlfVf0?feature=shared&t=973)\n<br>\n\n\nLater in the day, Cecilia visited FaunaMart and stumbled upon Kiara and Frieda [sneaking around](https://www.youtube.com/live/iAYrdIlfVf0?feature=shared&t=1728) the convenience store. While Kiara made a quick escape, Frieda panicked under Cecilia’s scrutiny. Their quirky interaction concluded with Frieda introducing Cecilia to her newly launched business, NanaEleven. During this encounter, Cecilia affectionately bestowed Frieda with the nickname \"Nanamoo,\" solidifying their growing camaraderie (see [Cecilia-Nanamoo: Friends From Business](#edge:moom-cecilia-immergreen-bottom-0-left-1)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nThough Cecilia’s motivations for fostering relationships were initially self-serving, she exhibited a surprising level of genuine care for those around her. Beneath her calculated plans lay a good heart and a willingness to help others in need. \n<br>\n\nThis duality was most evident in her interactions with another knight, Gonathon G. Despite their limited encounters, Cecilia felt an unspoken bond with him and went out of her way to offer support during his most difficult of moments (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: Green and Orange](#edge:cecilia-immergreen-gonathon-g-bottom-1-right-3)).",

            "title": "Nerissa Ravencroft",
            "content": "Nerissa had become a ghost. Slain by Kiara the day before—despite insisting she had done nothing wrong—she now wandered the land as a spirit, a soul without a body. But she wouldn’t remain that way forever. She had a plan. She would take vengeance against Kiara for what the phoenix had taken from her.\n<br>\n\n[I have become a ghost](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CFSfP27KTco?feature=shared&t=317)\n<br>\n\nBut before that, an idea struck her—she could use her ghostly form to explore the kingdom’s cracks and hidden corners, places she couldn’t normally reach. She had long harbored suspicions about the King, and this was her chance to uncover the truth.\n<br>\n\nShe drifted through the kingdom, but nothing seemed too out of place aside from a number of abandoned buildings. However, once she reached the castle, peculiarities began to reveal themselves. A hidden prison cell. The complete absence of the Jade Sword guild’s symbol in the castle grounds. Warping crystals that led to unknown locations. Blocked paths. It was odd. Some might dismiss these things as simple design choices, but Nerissa thought otherwise—especially when she stumbled upon [cryptic messages](https://www.youtube.com/live/CFSfP27KTco?feature=shared&t=5386) hidden by two of the guards.\n<br>\n\nUpon decrypting the message, it read: \"Land of fated destiny echoed o'er and o'er again. Break the chains and it will flee, back to where it all began.\" What could it possibly mean?\n<br>\n\nWhatever it was, Nerissa needed to inform the others. When she reunited with the group, however, she immediately spotted Kiara among them and lunged at her to exact [revenge](https://www.youtube.com/live/CFSfP27KTco?feature=shared&t=5918). But before she could do anything, Gonathon stepped in, stopping the fight. The two oranges then claimed that there was a way to bring Nerissa back to life—by venturing into the Volcanic Dungeon and completing its trials. If successful, the phoenix would bless her with rebirth. Hearing this, Nerissa relented and agreed to let them help her.\n<br>\n\nBefore setting off, she first shared her findings with Gonathon and Mario.\n<br>\n\n[Nerissa explaining her findings](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CFSfP27KTco?feature=shared&t=6694)\n<br>\n\nThe three of them agreed to keep an eye on these strange discoveries and to remain cautious of the King. With that in mind, Nerissa left with Gonathon and Kiara for the dungeon, where she successfully reclaimed her body and returned to the world of the living.\n<br>\n\nUpon her return, she came across Koseki Bijou, who was out in the fields. Curious, Nerissa approached to greet her—but Bijou didn’t respond.\n<br>\n\nInstead, she continued pulling crops from the ground, her movements eerily methodical. No, calling it \"harvesting\" wouldn’t be right—at this pace, she was outright destroying the fields.\n<br>\n\n[No! Not my salad!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CFSfP27KTco?feature=shared&t=8362)\n<br>\n\nStartled, Nerissa tried to stop her, calling for help. Soon, everyone gathered, watching in shock as Bijou tore through the crops with unrelenting speed. They yelled at her, tried using their Revelations to snap her out of it, but nothing worked. Only when the fields were left barren did she finally stop. And then, in a chilling voice, she uttered just four words:\n<br>\n*\"May the land starve.\"*\n<br>\nAnd with that, she vanished.\n<br>\n\nSo it was Bijou who had been destroying the fields all along. But more importantly—why? What had happened to her? Why had she done such a thing? The group was left shaken and confused. Nerissa, however, was more upset than anything else. Not out of concern for Bijou, but because the crops had been her main source of income, and their destruction meant a massive hit to her profits. Still, grumbling under her breath, she replanted everything to prevent a potential famine.\n<br>\n\nThen she called it a day—a day of unraveling mysteries, of uncovering hidden truths within the kingdom. And perhaps, of foreshadowing what was yet to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Gonathon awoke from a restless night, haunted by troubling thoughts. The corruption spreading through the kingdom weighed heavily on his mind, alongside the impending sense of doom tied to the \"calm before the storm.\" Above all, his Pearl—the one he cherished most—had forgotten him, leaving an ache of loneliness and doubt in his heart.\n\n<br>\n\n\nYet, despite the emotional turmoil, Gonathon resolved to press on. As a knight entrusted by his queen, he couldn't afford to falter. He steeled himself, determined to complete the grand statue of his queen—a monument of his devotion—before the day ended. But as he set to work, he was interrupted by an unexpected sight: why were there people in his guild base?\n<br>\n\n[What are you doing here](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=122)\n<br>\n\n\nHe discovered Cecilia and Raora, members of other guilds, poking around in his guild's base. His confusion faded quickly as he stepped outside and was met with an eerie sight. The Moai statue Bijou had built now wept blood, a chilling omen of the [corruption](https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=401) spreading unchecked through the land.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBefore he could investigate further, Gonathon focused on [reviving](https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=1019) Nerissa, who had perished the day before and lingered as a ghost. Determined to restore her to life, Gonathon recalled ancient scriptures detailing how the Kiara as a phoenix could aid in resurrection. So, gathering Nerissa and Kiara, he embarked on a journey to the Volcanic Dungeon once more. Their shared efforts bore fruit, and the raven knight was revived.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDuring their quest, Gonathon took the opportunity to share his growing concerns about Bijou’s corruption to Nerissa, who promised her assistance in stopping the princess’s plans. But their conversation was overheard by Bijou herself.\n<br>\n\n[Did you see that?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=1795)\n<br>\n\nLater, while passing by Cecilia and Nanamoo playing a memory game, Gonathon decided to join in for a change of pace. Despite not taking it seriously, he won, much to Cecilia’s chagrin—a small but welcome reprieve from the heavier matters at hand.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThen came an utterly bizarre and unexpected detour: Gonathon, a male knight, was rumored to be [pregnant?](https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=6299) The absurd idea stemmed from a visit to the newly opened NanaEleven store, where Nanamoo somehow turned a simple errand into a side quest. Despite the silliness, Gonathon found himself drawn into the chaos. He half-heartedly worried over Nanamoo’s grim warnings about male pregnancy survival rates and even agreed to an impromptu \"pregnancy test.\" \n<br>\n\n[How did we get here](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=7535)\n<br>\n\n\nOf course, Gonathon wasn’t pregnant, but the sheer absurdity of the situation lightened the mood. He recognized it as a much-needed distraction from the burdens he'd been carrying. Perhaps his friends sensed his struggles and tried to cheer him up—or perhaps they were simply eccentric. One knight, however, showed genuine care, going out of their way to remind Gonathon of his worth and ensure he didn’t feel alone (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: Green and Orange](#edge:cecilia-immergreen-gonathon-g-bottom-1-right-3)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nBut yet, the lighthearted moments were fleeting. As Gonathon neared completion of the queen’s statue, he realized he was too late to prevent a grave disaster—Bijou had spread her corruption to Mococo and possibly beyond. Feeling unsafe, Gonathon fled the scene.\n\n<br>\n\n[Looming danger](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=11447)\n<br>\n\n\nHe penned two letters that night: one to Amelia Watson, warning her of the growing corruption and urging her to investigate the king, whom Gonathon was beginning to doubt. He implored her to trust no one, not even him, as the days ahead would be fraught with uncertainty. The second letter was for his queen, updating her on the kingdom’s state and vowing to protect it in her absence, as her loyal knight.\n<br>\n\n[The most important message](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=11765)\n<br>\n\n\nThe final day loomed ominously on the horizon. Despite the mounting dangers, Gonathon knew he had to face whatever came with courage and resolve, for the sake of his kingdom, his queen and the ones he cared about.\n<br>\n\n[\"Who is Gonathon G\" by Emico Otero](#out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxNvjxcmzW4)\n<br>\n\n[\"Rizzle me this\" by Hiro](#out:https://x.com/hiroavrs/status/1832437338469011589)\n\n",

But beyond that, she knew little about him. She didn’t know what goals he had, what he wanted.\n<br>\n\nNor did she know that his wife had forgotten about him.\n\n<br>\n\nWhile trying to distract Gonathon to make him lose in the memory game, she accidentally stepped on a mine—by asking where [his wife](https://www.youtube.com/live/iAYrdIlfVf0?feature=shared&t=6080) was. His mood dropped instantly, and understandably so. Cecilia felt bad. She hadn’t meant to bring up such a sensitive topic and quickly tried to divert the conversation elsewhere, but the sadness in his voice lingered. She wanted to cheer him up, but she knew too little about the knight to do so.\n<br>\n\nLater on, Gonathon stopped by the library to donate a book. Cecilia happened to be there at the time and happily accepted it. Curious, she gave it a read, and through it, she finally learned a little more about the knight.\n<br>\n[\"Accidentally found it\", he said](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/iAYrdIlfVf0?feature=shared&t=6827)\n<br>\n\nThe book, A Knight’s Tale, told the story of a humble knight who was once lost but gained purpose through the adventures he shared with the people he had tagged along with. As the days went on, he made more and more memories with these quirky individuals, and each one, he cherished. Yet, as much as others called him humble and steadfast, he felt conflicted, for he had a selfish wish. A wish that the memories of those around him would never return, so he could continue spending these peaceful days with them. But such a wish would never come true, and so, he would press on, doing what he believed was right.\n<br>\n\nAs much as Gonathon claimed he had \"accidentally found\" the book, Cecilia knew full well it was his story. So, to make up for her mistake from earlier, she [called](https://www.youtube.com/live/iAYrdIlfVf0?feature=shared&t=9566) the knight for another match in the memory game. This time, her goal wasn’t to win—she wanted Gonathon to realize his worth.\n<br>\n\n[Therapy session](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/iAYrdIlfVf0?feature=shared&t=10047)\n<br>\n\nShe purposely lost to give him the win, and when he tried to reject it, insisting that it was his loud mouth that had caused her to mess up, she pushed back. She wanted Gonathon to appreciate himself more.\n\n<br>\n\nThe gesture was simple but genuine. Though initially hesitant, Gonathon eventually thanked Cecilia for it.\n\n<br>\n\nFrom there on, the two gained newfound respect for each other. Before this, whenever Cecilia rambled on about her crackhead theory regarding the King, Gonathon would roll his eyes and call her crazy. But now? They were investigating the theory together. No matter how absurd her yapping got, he listened with genuine interest. It was unexpected, indeed, for these two to team up, but strangely enough, it didn’t feel out of place.\n<br>\nAs if they had known each other before.\n<br>\n\n[You're finally listening](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/iAYrdIlfVf0?feature=shared&t=10359)\n<br>\n\n[\"A distraction\" by Hyoweii](#out:https://x.com/weiiyxn/status/1832436596261724166)\n",

      "dayRecap": "## Day 8: Beginning of The End\n\nThe final day of the journey tied up many loose ends while simultaneously raising even more questions. It was a crowded day—a lot happened, from shifting relationships to the resolution of major storylines.\n<br>\n\nFirst and foremost, the fight against corruption reached its peak. Koseki Bijou, the Stain Princess, was going all out, spreading the Stain far and wide—to the kingdom, to her friends, to everywhere. With corruption spreading at an alarming rate, the remaining uncorrupted banded together, formulating strategies and crafting one final plan to defeat the corruption once and for all—and save their friends in the process.\n<br>\n\n[The Stain Princess' bleeding statue](#image:images-opt/corruption.webp)\n<br>\n\nAs the story neared its climax, the relationships between our heroes evolved in ways fitting for a grand finale. *The Sidechick Polygamy* collapsed, bringing an end to the once-thriving chaos of endless romantic entanglements. At the same time, the heartbreaking case of Gonathon and Jyonathan finally reached its resolution.\n<br>\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing rivalry between FaunaMart and NanaEleven took an unexpected turn—one that no one could have anticipated. What had once been a fierce business war transformed into something far more intriguing, culminating in what might just be the Deal of the Century.\n<br>\n\n[FaunaMart VS NanaEleven](#image:images-opt/faunamoom.webp)\n<br>\n\nAnd finally, the most crucial moment of all—the battle against the Stain King. But even more shocking than the battle itself was the truth that unraveled about the kingdom, and more specifically, its ruler. A revelation that flipped everyone’s understanding of their journey on its head, sending them hurtling toward unexpected new adventures that lay ahead.\n<br>\n\nWith corruption at its peak, relationships transformed, rivalries settled, and secrets unearthed, the kingdom stood at the brink of a new era. And yet, despite the battles won, this was only the beginning of something far, far greater.\n<br>\n\n[\"The finale is here.\" by keenbiscuit](#out:https://x.com/keenbiscuit/status/1832589405451931972)\n\n",

            "content": "Fuwawa began her final day in the kingdom with a heavy heart. The once-thriving lands surrounding her small hut were in disarray—fire burned through the fields, leaves withered on the trees, and faint traces of blood stained the ground. Most heartbreaking of all, her beloved [chickens](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=394), the source of so much joy and companionship, had vanished without a trace.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDesperate for answers, Fuwawa turned to [Gonathon and Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=808), the two people she trusted most. They explained that a terrible corruption had spread throughout the kingdom, and worse still, her close companion Mococo had fallen victim to it. Fuwawa's fears were soon realized as she witnessed Mococo's rampage firsthand. The once-kind and playful companion now spread chaos, howling rabidly as she tore through the land.\n<br>\n\n[What is Mococo doing?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/31OnEJrRDfU?si=Be-tl0XykKPAJTZ8&amp;start=939)\n<br>\n\nThe others warned Fuwawa that if Mococo couldn't be stopped, there was a grim possibility she would have to face justice in the [gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=1204). This news crushed Fuwawa. The kingdom's usual lighthearted atmosphere was gone, replaced by grim faces and solemn tones. Even Elizabeth, who had always been warm and supportive, wore a [heavy expression](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=1298) that mirrored the weight of the situation.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBut the fluffy one refused to let despair consume her. She had always been a beacon of joy and warmth for others, and now more than ever, she needed to remain true to herself. Determined to find hope amidst the chaos, Fuwawa began hatching a new flock of [chickens](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=2002). Their fluffy white feathers and cheerful chirps brought her a glimmer of happiness, even if only for a fleeting moment.\n<br>\n\n\nHowever, the peace didn’t last. Fuwawa heard Mococo’s agonized cries and, unable to bear seeing her companion in such pain, rushed to her side. Unbeknownst to her, it was a trap. Mococo, fully corrupted, lured Fuwawa close enough to spread the Stain to her as well.\n<br>\n\n[The fluffy one gets corrupted](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/31OnEJrRDfU?si=q2tl8yV-u4MXCXum&amp;start=2792)\n<br>\n\n\nNow corrupted, Fuwawa joined Nerissa and Mococo in wreaking havoc across the kingdom. The Stain twisted her mind, forcing her to destroy the very fields she had cherished and even [turn against](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=2925) her beloved chickens, slaying them in a fit of feral rage. Fuwawa’s [screams](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=3519) echoed across the land—cries of pain and torment from someone who no longer had control over her actions.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThanks to the unwavering efforts of the other heroes, the corruption was ultimately [cleansed](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=3973) from Fuwawa, Mococo, and the others. Although Fuwawa was heartbroken to find her chickens gone once again, she found solace in knowing that the Stain’s grip had been broken. Ever resilient, she resolved to rebuild. This time, she hatched more chickens than ever before, determined to protect them and regain a sense of normalcy. \n<br>\n\n...\n\n<br>\n\nHer joy was short-lived, however, as Mococo—by accident—decimated the flock once again.\n<br>\n\n[*♪ Yureta yuganda sekai ni dan dan ♪*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/31OnEJrRDfU?si=7TsPwSbv9amxpvre&amp;start=7268)\n<br>\n\nDespite her lingering sadness, Fuwawa joined the others in the [final battle](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=7996). Together, they fought valiantly and defeated the Stain, only to uncover a deeper truth: the true threat all along had been the King (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n<br>\n\n\nWith the battle over, Fuwawa and the others returned to the mysterious [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=9750), marking the end of her first chapter. \n",

Confusion swept over her—she had no memory of coming to the field, let alone causing the destruction. It was as if she had blacked out and woken to this desolation. Before she could process the scene, Calli started accusing her of raiding the crops and fields. To make matters worse, the reaper pointed out the Stain Hat perched on Mococo’s head, something she couldn’t explain.\n\n \n\n<br>\n\nThe pressure was overwhelming. Mococo began to break down under the weight of fear and guilt. Just then, Bijou appeared, offering comforting words and gentle headpats that momentarily soothed Mococo’s panic. But Bijou’s kindness was a façade—a ploy to lower Mococo’s defenses and allow the Stain to fully corrupt her.\n<br>\n\n[More like Mococorrupted](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TXwZjXEoxk?si=o6aBzC1hk3Ewre9E&amp;start=567)\n<br>\n\nCorruption soon consumed Mococo’s mind. Her thoughts were no longer her own as she spread chaos across the land, unleashing terrifying howls that sent others [fleeing](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=1315). When confronted, she would run away, unable to face those who sought to help her. A lingering sense of guilt and her natural cowardice occasionally disrupted the Stain’s hold on her, giving her brief moments of clarity. During one such moment, Mococo wandered through town searching for someone she could trust.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHer search led her to Elizabeth, the scarlet knight she admired and trusted deeply—a sister figure who had protected her since the beginning of their journey. Relief washed over Mococo as she approached Elizabeth, hoping for solace. But the reaction she received was far from what she had expected (see [Elizabeth-Mococo: Keeping My Promise](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-left-3-right-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAbandoned and betrayed in her eyes, Mococo’s despair allowed the Stain to tighten its grip [once more](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=1743). Fully corrupted, she spiraled into chaos, spreading destruction with her feral screams. It was agony—pain she couldn’t control. Even her closest companion, Fuwawa, fell victim to her corruption, and together, the two wreaked havoc across the land.\n<br>\n\n[BAU BAU!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=2836)\n<br>\n\nBut hope was not lost. Through an elaborate plan and unwavering dedication, Ina and the other heroes—including Elizabeth—crafted a cure to combat the corruption. Their efforts succeeded, pulling Mococo and the others out of the darkness. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, Mococo no longer felt hated or abandoned. She was embraced by those who had fought tirelessly to [save her](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=4020).\n\n<br>\n\n\nSober once more, Mococo resolved to make amends. Before the final battle, she returned to her old vice: [gambling](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=5633). At least this kind of \"corruption\" was harmless in comparison. Though her winnings were modest, she felt victorious in spirit. Mococo then turned her attention to cleaning up the mess she had caused, even stopping by FaunaMart to claim some overdue funds. For the first time in a while, life felt peaceful.\n\n<br>\n\nAs part of her redemption, Mococo decided to help Fuwawa with the chickens, hoping to make up for the chaos she’d unleashed upon them before. However, her sharp claws got the better of her again, and the chickens unfortunately met another untimely end.\n\n<br>\n\n[She must really hate chickens](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TXwZjXEoxk?si=hTcidaLzCx7pJMaJ&amp;start=7247)\n<br>\n\nAfter the final battle, Mococo and her companions uncovered the truth about the king (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)). They were then returned to the mysterious [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=9745), marking the end of the first chapter in Mococo’s journey.",

The sight was grim: charred fields, crumbled homes, and lifeless landscapes. She wanted to believe it was a nightmare, but the heavy air told her it was all too real. The corruption—the vile force she had sworn to protect against—had spread far and wide.\n\n<br>\n\n\nJust the day before, Elizabeth had bid her companions farewell, leaving the kingdom in its usual harmony. But something sinister had unfolded in her absence. Bloodstains and scorched crops painted the once-thriving land. Most heartbreaking of all were the remains of her beloved chickens, raised with care and affection, now gone. Grief turned to resolve—Elizabeth vowed to find the culprit and deliver [justice](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=990).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAwakening in the ruined kingdom, Elizabeth stood alone. Amid the desolation, only a solitary red knight remained. The loneliness was suffocating. To honor her lost chickens, she built a small memorial before beginning the arduous task of cleaning the ruined land... by herself. \n\n<br>\n\n[I feel...alone](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/_urPfTQnLes?si=ecdhhjj71kzhplJw&amp;start=1670)\n<br>\n\nCompanionship came only when the other heroes awoke. Among them was Calli, the trusted tavern owner and Elizabeth’s guildmate. Together, they speculated on the corruption’s [origins](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=5396). Initially, Elizabeth suspected Nerissa, the “witch”, but Nerissa proclaimed her innocence. Suspicion then fell on Koseki Bijou, whose behavior had grown increasingly erratic.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Elizabeth drank an invisibility potion, intending to spy on Bijou. But her stealth attempt ended in a less-than-graceful predicament.\n\n<br>\n\n[I am the Magical Talking Cape!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/_urPfTQnLes?si=sgeX8b8c-lLqAn0n&amp;start=7369)\n<br>\n\nDespite the setbacks, Elizabeth’s confrontation with Bijou yielded critical evidence: the princess was indeed [corrupted](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=7533). In a private conversation with Calli, Elizabeth learned unsettling secrets about the [kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=7755). Guards spoke in cryptic riddles, and her guild’s presence in the castle had seemingly vanished. Elizabeth trusted Calli’s words but struggled to reconcile these revelations with her loyalty to the kingdom.\n\n<br>\n\n\nSuspicion weighed heavily on Elizabeth’s mind, and even small interactions between her companions sparked doubt. When Nerissa and Amelia entered the onsen together, Elizabeth’s curiosity led her to drink another invisibility potion—only to find herself in yet another sticky situation.\n\n<br>\n\n[I am THE Magical Talking Cape!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/_urPfTQnLes?si=d0gdqZP1KC_9-3ud&amp;start=8425)\n<br>\n\n\nDespite her struggles with stealth, Elizabeth’s interactions with her quirky comrades began to soften her once-hardened demeanor. Her stoic facade cracked when Gonathon mentioned Fuwawa’s outrageous claim that the chickens Elizabeth had lovingly raised were hers [instead](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=9134).\n\n<br>\n\n\nThese fleeting moments reminded Elizabeth that she wasn’t alone. She didn’t have to shoulder the burden of the kingdom’s salvation by herself—her comrades were there to support her.\n<br>\n\n[Thank you, Gonathon](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=10485)\n<br>\n\n\nYet, these moments of solace were brief. News spread that Mococo, a member of the Jade Sword and someone Elizabeth cared for deeply, had fallen to corruption. Witnessing Mococo’s descent firsthand was devastating. Elizabeth, who had long fought to protect her, now faced the grim possibility of having to end her suffering (see [Elizabeth-Mococo: Keeping My Promise](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-left-3-right-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhen hope seemed lost, Ina and Raora arrived with news of a potential cure for the corruption. But there was no time to waste—Fuwawa, too, succumbed to the corruption right before Elizabeth’s [eyes](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=11473), slaughtering her remaining chickens. With Calli, Gonathon, Raora, and Ina, Elizabeth devised a desperate plan: disrupt the corrupted ones’ minds with music, creating an opening to administer the cure.\n<br>\n\n\nThe plan was perilous but necessary. Elizabeth faced her target head-on, determined to save even those who had caused her pain (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Start Again](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-3-left-2)). \n\n<br>\n\n\nAgainst all odds, the cure worked. One by one, the corrupted were freed. Though Elizabeth’s heart ached at Mococo and Fuwawa’s resistance, she pressed on, knowing their salvation was worth every effort.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAfter a grueling battle, the group watched as Koseki Bijou—once corrupted and now freed—drank the cure, breaking the chains of the [Stain Princess](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=13749).\n\n<br>\n\nPeace returned, though it was accompanied by the kingdom’s usual antics. From Shiori’s revelation of being a [single mother](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=15484) to a child with Elizabeth’s former daughter, to spicy novels pairing Elizabeth and Nerissa, the chaos was a welcome reprieve from the horrors of corruption.\n\n<br>\n\nFollowing a final group picture, Elizabeth and her comrades prepared for their ultimate battle against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=16809). The fight was fierce, but the heroes triumphed.\n<br>\n\nHowever, their victory revealed a devastating truth: the king they had sworn to protect was the true villain (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)). Elizabeth, defined by her unwavering loyalty to the king, was thrown into turmoil. Could her beacon of light truly have been the source of such darkness?\n\n<br>\nUnable to raise her sword at first, Elizabeth clung to denial. But the sight of her friends in pain—Mococo suffering most of all—shattered her resolve. The king had to pay for his betrayal. And so, for the first time, Elizabeth wielded her blade not for her king, but for her comrades.\n<br>\n\n[For Justice!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/_urPfTQnLes?si=xQsUGR_UZBcLZWQP&amp;start=17881)\n<br>\nWhen the journey ended, the heroes found themselves back in the white room where it all [began](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=18386).

            "content": "Amelia’s final day in the kingdom began in an unusual and unsettling way. Her wide, sleepless eyes hinted at countless restless nights, and her inventory was filled to the brim with stacks of diamonds. Her movements were erratic, her words nonsensical, and every conversation she initiated revolved around the same frantic questions, spoken in a shaky tone: *“Have you seen my diamond?”* and *“Did you give me these diamonds?”* Her behavior left her companions uneasy and deeply concerned.\n<br>\n\n[Diamond... diamond... diamond...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/mxOT9QEg5dI?si=QIefO6CBFBGQ4gie&amp;start=315)\n<br>\n\nWhen asked what had happened, Amelia could only recall vague memories of diamonds, tied to an inexplicable sense of urgency. She insisted she had to retrieve them, as though her life depended on it. One by one, she questioned her friends—Elizabeth, Calli, Nerissa—leaving them confused and alarmed. [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=655), in particular, watched in distress as the detective he cherished began leaping from high places and engaging in increasingly reckless behavior.\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nAmelia’s obsession drove her to confront the king, whom she suspected of stealing her diamonds. Her usual wit and charm were replaced by raw desperation as she hurled accusations at the King, hissed at the guards, and uttered threats she’d never spoken before.\n<br>\n\n[You've taken everything from me](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=1218)\n<br>\n\n\nWhy was the blonde so consumed by these diamonds? Even she didn’t know. She only knew they held something precious—perhaps a memory, perhaps a bond. Frustration and despair began to erode her composure, yet her frenzied state ironically [shielded](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=1354) her from the corrupting influence of the Stain Princess, Koseki Bijou.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile scouring the library for answers, Amelia was inexplicably drawn to a particular shelf. One book caught her attention, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t retrieve it. Nerissa, passing by in her ghostly form, lent a helping hand—after unintentionally scaring Amelia half to death.\n\n<br>\n\n[AHHHHHHHHHH](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/mxOT9QEg5dI?si=lLk-ar130gfWZU1x&amp;start=2120)\n<br>\n\nThe book’s contents didn’t immediately clarify Amelia’s plight, but Nerissa interpreted its tale. She spoke of a knight described as a [“diamond”](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=2807), a revelation that stirred something deep within Amelia’s foggy mind. Slowly, faint images began to surface—a silhouette, blurry but familiar. Though she couldn’t piece everything together yet, this discovery helped Amelia calm down and regain a semblance of her [usual self](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=3113).\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nStill, her obsession lingered. Even as the kingdom spiraled into chaos, with corruption spreading and Mococo’s screams echoing through the land, Amelia remained fixated on her [diamonds](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=4279). Her companions, realizing the significance of her quest, began guiding her toward the truth.\n<br>\n* [Calli](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=3960) purchased every diamond from FaunaMart to deter Amelia, urging her to search within herself for the true diamond.\n* [Ina](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=3591) hinted that she should journey eastward, toward the Cerulean Cup guild.\n* [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=8343) advised her to seek a knight dressed in orange.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAmelia retreated to the onsen she had built, sorting through her [thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=8404). The clues all pointed to one person: Gonathon. Perhaps he held the key to her questions. But just as she prepared to find him, a chaotic force intervened—a figure known as the Hot Pink One (see [Hot Pink One-Amelia Watson: Non-Traditional Relation](#edge:ame-hot-pink-one-left-2-bottom-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nWith guidance from [Raora and Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=9121), who confirmed the Hot Pink One’s deception, Amelia managed to evade her traps and press onward. Finally, with Nerissa’s push, she and Gonathon unraveled the mystery (see [Gonathon-Amelia: A Knight’s Wish](#edge:gonathon-g-ame-top-2-bottom-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhen the final battle arrived, Amelia had fully regained her sense of self. Alongside her friends, she wielded her magnifying glass against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=10901), fighting with determination. Though they emerged victorious, the battle revealed a shocking twist—the true villain was someone they hadn’t anticipated (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe group was ultimately returned to the white room, marking the end of their chapter in this [enigmatic adventure](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=12549).\n<br>\n\nAmelia’s journey throughout this tale was a testament to her quirks and spirit. She remained curious, witty, and ever investigative, with a playful streak that brought light to even the darkest moments. Her sunny demeanor and relentless determination to solve mysteries left an indelible mark on her companions. Whether or not her path crosses theirs again, her impact is undeniable, and whichever path she decides to tackle next will surely be met with unwavering support and respect.\n\n<br>\n\nThank you for your service, detective.\n<br>\n\n[Ame](#easter:ame)",

            "content": "\n[“They found me… They found me!”](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=248)\n<br>\n\nThe kingdom's elusive hermit, Peasant Da Bae, was in distress. Not a single soul had spoken her name since the first day. She had chosen a life of solitude in the woods, far from the chaos of the kingdom, but now, on the final day, she was dragged back into the fray. Lost, bewildered, and unsure of her purpose, even her friend, Three, wasn't even called [Three](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=642) anymore, Da Bae clung to the only comfort she knew: a giant statue of Tam Gandr, the figure she had pledged her [allegiance to](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=732).\n\n<br>\n\n\nHer mind raced. Who could have brought her back? The answer was clear: the King. The devil in sheep's clothing. Her fury burned bright as she vowed to confront him and demand answers. \n\n<br>\n\n\nHer first interaction upon returning to the kingdom was with the infamous Sir Gonathon. His reputation had even reached her secluded corner of the woods. Naturally, her greeting was to respectfully call his hat [\"fugly.\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=1249)\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs the day unfolded, Da Bae’s confusion only deepened. A princess? Corruption? Queen Mario? None of it made any sense. Overwhelmed by the kingdom's strange developments, she pulled Sir Gonathon aside and insisted he take her to the King so she could unleash her anger.\n\n<br>\n\n[What do you want, old man](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5NGryTaGqk?si=tcYRdht25LG-Vqye&amp;start=1526)\n<br>\n\nDespite her frustration, she found fleeting moments of amusement. The ridiculously [long hats](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=1721) worn by some residents caught her attention, as did the drama of the Hot Pink One—a woman entangled in a dispute involving five wives. Bae was both astonished and spitefully compelled to mess with her (see [Bae-Hot Pink One: Pure Spite](#edge:peasant-da-bae-hot-pink-one-top-2-left-1)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Da Bae visited the tavern, hoping for a meal, only to discover the exorbitant prices—hundreds of coins for a single item. She caused a ruckus, alternately accused of being crazy and poor. Nerissa, the wealthiest person in the kingdom, graciously offered her some money, but Da Bae’s pride wouldn’t allow her to accept. Instead, she boldly claimed to be wealthy enough to afford the tavern on her own.\n\n<br>\n\n[LET ME OUTTTT!!!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5NGryTaGqk?si=u0uwY6JLFd-gEkPB&amp;start=2565)\n<br>\n\nFrustrated (and hungry), she cursed the gods for her suffering. At least the final battle was near, bringing the promise of an end to her ordeal. Armed with weapons as flimsy as paper, Da Bae took up the role of moral support while the other heroes bore the brunt of the fight. Together, they defeated the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=4028), only to uncover a devastating truth about their monarch (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nIn the end, Da Bae returned to the [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=5760) where her journey had begun.  \n",

            "content": "\nThe corruption was spreading, dark tendrils slowly consuming the world. Mario, understandably, was not a fan. On the final day, she awoke to a ruined kingdom. Mococo, completely overtaken by the Stain on her hand, was rampaging and spreading [chaos](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=650). But what broke Mario’s heart most was that the root of it all was her own daughter, Koseki Bijou. The sight of her kingdom in shambles and her beloved child in such a state weighed heavily on her soul.\n<br>\n\n[My beautiful daughter...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=773)\n<br>\n\nEven so, Mario refused to give in to despair. There were still others searching for a way to stop the corruption. She teamed up with Gonathon and Ina to [discuss](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=855) a potential cure: a legendary golden apple said to cleanse the Stain. During their planning, Mario uncovered a stunning truth—Ina was her long-lost daughter all along (see [Mario-Ina: Mother?](#edge:raora-panthera-nino-ina-right-1-left-1)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nFueled by newfound hope, Mario and Ina set out to find the golden apples. Their journey was a success, and they managed to craft a [cure](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=2153) for the corruption. Quickly reuniting with their comrades, they devised a bold plan: lure the corrupted individuals into Mori’s Tavern and force them to drink the cure. Time was running out as the corruption claimed more victims, including Nerissa and Fuwawa.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe plan, though risky, worked for most of the corrupted. Bijou, however, was another matter entirely. She rejected Mario not just as her mother but also as a friend. She renounced her humanity altogether, succumbing completely to the Stain. The rejection cut deeply, leaving Mario devastated by her perceived failure.\n\n<br>\n\nThe situation only grew more painful when Mario had to witness her daughters face off in the arena. It was the only way to compel Bijou to drink the cure. Watching her children fight was excruciating—what mother could bear such a sight? But Mario had no choice but to endure. In the end, Ina emerged victorious, and Bijou, defeated, was forced to drink the cure. The Stain Princess was no more, and the corruption’s hold was broken.\n<br>\n\n[Yippie!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=4732)\n<br>\n\nThe family reunion that followed was bittersweet and deeply emotional. Mario, overjoyed, embraced her daughters, finally free from the shadow of the Stain.\n<br>\n\n\nWith the corruption behind them, Mario had a rare opportunity to relax and reconnect with the people around her. She greeted Peasant Da Bae, a long-lost member of the Amber Coin, gifting her a [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=5460). She indulged in moments of playful grandeur, standing on her throne to feel like the queen she always claimed to be. She joined in on the chicken game, relishing the lighter side of life.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBut the peace was short-lived. Mario joined the heroes for one final confrontation: a battle against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=7691). Yet the ultimate revelation shattered their understanding—it wasn’t the Stains that were truly evil but someone they never would have suspected (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n\n<br>\n\nAnd so, the journey came full [circle](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=9344). The heroes found themselves back in the white room where it had all begun. From being lost and confused to building her own castle, firing her knight, becoming a mother, and declaring herself queen, Mario had carved out her own path in this strange kingdom.\n\n\n",

            "content": "\nNanamoo began her final day overhearing whispers about plans to corrupt the world, destroy the lands, and terrorize the lives of its people. After careful consideration, she decided that… it probably wasn’t important and continued on [her way](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=216). She then shared a brief exchange with Ina, proudly asserting that she was the [“main chick”](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=385), not the side.\n\n<br>\n\n\nGetting sidetracked aside, Nanamoo had a critical mission that day. She had recently launched her business venture, NanaEleven, which had gained immense popularity thanks to her lottery tickets. The tickets seemed like an incredible deal, with winners walking away with hundreds of coins. What the buyers didn’t realize was that hidden on each ticket was a clause written in an ancient language. This clause legally obligated them to contribute a portion of their income to NanaEleven “for the greater good.”\n\n<br>\n\n[Not a scam if you agreed to it](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/oq_4QZacuso?si=jke3kI6TUf59Ttxl&amp;start=688)\n<br>\n\nHer goal was simple: to collect what she was owed. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned. Nerissa, whom she believed to be wealthy, turned out to be nearly broke (though unknown to Nanamoo, she’d been tricked—see [Nerissa-Fauna: My Money](#edge:ceres-fauna-nerissa-ravencroft-bottom-2-top-1)). Similarly, Gonathon, another supposed high-roller, had already spent most of his wealth on [others](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=2891).\n\n<br>\n\n\nDespite the setbacks, Nanamoo wasn’t discouraged. Her business had already made a name for itself, and that was all she needed. NanaEleven wasn’t just a convenience store; it was the cornerstone of her larger scheme to support and elevate FaunaMart (see [Fauna-Nanamoo: Deal Of The Century](#edge:moom-ceres-fauna-top-1-left-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nLater, she engaged in some more dubious activities, including selling [diamonds](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=2154) to a schizophrenic Amelia and having a very questionable conversation with [Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=5064). As the day progressed, Nanamoo regrouped with her Scarlet Wand guildmates to prepare for the final dungeon. Before their journey, Nanamoo unveiled the secret she’d been harboring since day one.\n\n<br>\n\n[Are you a weirdo like me?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/oq_4QZacuso?si=aVeTrVzPX1DOUhMb&amp;start=3518)\n<br>\n\nUnlike everyone else in the kingdom, Nanamoo hadn’t lost her memory upon arriving. She pretended to have amnesia to avoid standing out and being labeled as a weirdo. She confessed to her friends that, in her old world, she had lots of friends, drove a Ferrari, and was an incredibly cool person overall. While she feared being judged, her friends’ reactions were warm and supportive. This touched Nanamoo deeply, though unbeknownst to her, they just thought she was eccentric and humored her to avoid hurting her feelings.\n\n<br>\n\n\nDuring a moment of downtime, Nanamoo received a call from a familiar yet unexpected person: Peasant Da Bae, who had been dragged back to the kingdom after being lost in the woods. Nanamoo comforted her in the most friendly way possible—by calling her [crazy](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=4574).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAfter assisting her comrades in the Ancient Sewer dungeon, the final showdown against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=7584) was upon them. Nanamoo initially planned to stay on the sidelines and watch everyone else get flattened while relaxing. Instead, she ended up getting [flattened herself](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=8078). \n\n<br>\n\n\nDespite the challenges, the heroes triumphed over the Stain King. But their victory was overshadowed by a devastating revelation about the king they had been serving (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs the heroes returned to the white room where their journey began, they were a mix of joyful and shaken, reflecting on the bonds they had forged and the adventures they had shared. But then came the final, heartbreaking twist.\n\n<br>\n\nNanamoo, upon returning to the white room, forgot everything that had transpired during her time in Libestal. The adventure, the king, the convenience stores, and, most tragically, the friendships she had formed—all vanished from her memory (see [Cecilia-Nanamoo: Oh, she forgot...](#edge:moom-cecilia-immergreen-bottom-0-left-1)).\n",

Withering trees, raging fires, and ravaged fields stretched as far as her eyes could see. Something sinister had happened. It didn’t take long for her to confront a potential culprit: Koseki Bijou, known now as the *Stain Princess*. \n\n<br>\n\n[Did you do this?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/evcruocvE3g?si=TZosSX5I76ctYpMW&amp;start=394)\n<br>\n\nCalli could sense the malevolence radiating from the corrupted gem maiden. Although Bijou denied responsibility for the destruction, she admitted to taking pleasure in the chaos. Calli swore to bring her to justice.\n<br>\n\n\nThe corruption spreading through the kingdom had even reached Calli’s beloved [tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=882), a place she’d worked tirelessly to build. Seeking a plan, she discussed the dire situation with her guildmate, [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=1831). They needed to act swiftly before the corruption consumed everything. Adding to the turmoil, Jyonathan—whose true identity Calli had not yet recalled—was behaving oddly, obsessing over [\"diamonds\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=2441) in an unsettling manner.\n\n<br>\n\n\nCalli’s suspicions about the kingdom’s leadership deepened when Nerissa invited her to explore the [castle](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=3441). Together, they uncovered its many secrets, though the investigation was briefly derailed when Bijou ambushed Calli with a *\"[Joe Mama\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=4073)* joke. Very sinister indeed.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Calli ventured into the Ancient Sewer Dungeon to recover the last missing fragments of her memories. There, she realized that Jyonathan was none other than [Amelia Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=7646).\n\n<br>\n\n\nThough the reaper lacked the combat skills of her allies or the investigative genius of others, she had her own unique talents: running a tavern and mastering the culinary arts. Embracing her role, she began preparing vast amounts of food to support her friends in their fight against the corruption. When hope dwindled, as materials for crafting cures ran scarce, Calli stepped up and single-handedly saved the day by making the necessary cures [herself](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=8071).\n\n<br>\n\n[The tavern owner saves the day](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/evcruocvE3g?si=id5leyflOV1hykFD&amp;start=8835)\n<br>\n\nThe cures worked. Through a collaborative effort, the corrupted individuals were freed, and the kingdom began to stabilize. \n\n<br>\n\n\nWith the chaos subsiding, everyone gathered at Calli’s tavern to celebrate. It was the most patrons her establishment had ever seen—a moment that would have filled her with joy if only her customers had money to pay for their [meals](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=11522).\n\n<br>\n\n\nUnexpectedly, however, Calli made sales more meaningful than any food order. Her tavern, aptly named Death Do Us Part, wasn’t just a place for meals—it was also a venue for divorce services. Since its opening, this side of her business had remained dormant, as the kingdom’s couples were too lovey-dovey to require her services. But Calli had always believed that one day, she’d get her chance. That day had come.\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nOn the final day, Calli achieved her long-awaited goal, securing her first three divorce sales: one for [Bijou and Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=11280), another for [Bijou and The Hot Pink One](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=11701), and a third for [Bijou and Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=12162). The princess boasted about being freed from the shackles of marriage, much to Calli's delight.\n\n<br>\n\nWhen the final battle arrived, Calli and her allies faced off against the Stain King, vanquishing him in an epic confrontation. Along the way, they uncovered the shocking truths about the real king’s dark secrets (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)). Their journey concluded as they were returned to the mysterious white room, marking the end of this chapter in Calli’s tale.\n\n<br>\n\nBefore signing off, Calli left one last remark, addressing a peculiar customer review of her food.\n\n<br>\n\n[Peeing on food](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/evcruocvE3g?si=TvbG_jKQwRp9fagg&amp;start=15340)",

            "content": "The end of the world was afoot—or so everyone kept saying. Corruption plagued the lands, chaos spread like wildfire, and impending doom loomed over the horizon. For many, this would have been cause for panic, a time to reflect on their lives, relationships, and everything they’d built. But for our CEO? It was a business opportunity. What better way to capitalize on the apocalypse than with an End of the World Sale? After all, if the world was ending, everything must go.\n\n<br>\n\n[End of World Sale is crazy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/8x-MVX8h9gU?si=upbpi2piV4Z8ERvt&amp;start=142)\n<br>\n\nIt was classic Fauna: profits first, everything else later. Although she believed her business troubles had ended after the Mococo situation, she soon discovered a new rival in the market. NanaEleven, run by someone she once thought of as a friend—Nanamoo—was stealing customers. The rival store had become popular, selling more items and even lottery tickets, much to Fauna’s annoyance. As a savvy CEO, Fauna knew what had to be done. She’d eliminate the competition—not literally, of course, but in a business sense.\n\n<br>\n\n\nPreparing for the negotiation of her life, Fauna was interrupted by Nerissa, who approached her with a story about being tricked by Nanamoo and a request for a favor (see [Nerissa-Fauna: My Money](#edge:ceres-fauna-nerissa-ravencroft-bottom-2-top-1)). Before attending to that, though, Fauna got back to making sales. [Calli](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=473) stopped by FaunaMart to buy diamonds—closing the deal for a whopping 25,000 coins. Calli also mentioned the oncoming war and the corruption spreading across the kingdom, but Fauna barely batted an eye. She had more pressing matters to attend to.\n\n<br>\n\n\nLater, Fauna arranged a meeting with Nanamoo on the library's third floor. The two had the most intense business discussion of their careers (see [Fauna-Nanamoo: Deal Of The Century](#edge:moom-ceres-fauna-top-1-left-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAfterward, Fauna made even more sales by selling battle gear to [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=2406). She also assisted Cecilia with her [ritual](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=2977) to control the princess. Bijou stopped by to donate some books to the library. It was amusing to note that despite receiving thousands of coins to build the library and its massive size, the library’s collection still consisted of only four books. The ones Bijou donated were... questionable, but Fauna had anticipated this, even setting up a dedicated section for them.\n<br>\n[Spicy Novels](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/8x-MVX8h9gU?si=IMjZK6slIHg67-Pp&amp;start=2573)\n<br>\n\nGonathon visited next—seriously, FaunaMart was busy that day. He informed Fauna that Nerissa, her employee, had succumbed to the corruption. Fauna’s response? She couldn't care less, and congratulated Gonathon on winning the lottery two days prior and handed him his prize. Though puzzled by Fauna’s priorities, Gonathon accepted and even bought another 21 lottery tickets, contributing to the library fund. \n\n<br>\n\n[Dang that sucks.... Anyway](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=4316)\n<br>\n\n\nMococo also showed up to remind Fauna of the money owed to her from two days ago. To everyone’s surprise, Fauna actually paid her [back](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=5001). You really had to question the mindset of these “heroes,” collecting debts on the day of the apocalypse.\n\n<br>\n\n\nAs the final battle loomed, Fauna had a brilliant idea: sell battle gear to her fellow heroes at exorbitant prices. Knowing most were too preoccupied with the corruption to negotiate, she crafted shields and swords and made a [fortune](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=7180).\n<br>\n\n\nThen came the final showdown against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=7696). Even as chaos erupted and heroes were flattened left and right, Fauna’s capitalistic instincts kicked in. She attempted to charge for her [healing abilities](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=7796) but, seeing no buyers, ended up providing them for free.\n\n<br>\n\n\nUpon the Stain King’s defeat, a shocking twist left all the heroes reeling (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n\n<br>\n\nIn the end, the heroes returned to the [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=9420) where their journey had begun. Thus concluded the story of our favorite green CEO. From being summoned as a hero, Fauna chose the unconventional path of becoming an “NPC” and opening her own business, inadvertently creating one of the story’s key plot points. Her dedication to making money and staying true to her ideals was unmatched.\n<br>\n\nAlthough her business practices often raised eyebrows, Fauna’s ability to establish capitalism in a fantasy setting—and create a convenience store that sold lottery tickets—was nothing short of genius. While this marked the end of her story, FaunaMart left an undeniable impression on everyone involved.\n<br>\n\nWith the store closing and the library’s purpose fulfilled, the CEO bid farewell to her customers and supporters. As she ventured off onto a new journey, one thing was certain: Fauna’s wit, dedication, and entrepreneurial spirit would not be forgotten. \n<br>\n\nFaunwell, miss CEO.\n<br>\n\n[Faunamart](#easter:faunamart)\n<br>\n\n[\"Boss of FaunaMart\" by Ano Yatsu](#out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7fHJcrmO0U)",

She was focused on advancing her ultimate goal—a \"Happy Sugar Life.\"\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile wandering around the kingdom, Shiori crossed paths with Bijou, who gifted her a Stain Hat and, in a surprising twist, nominated her as the [Stain Prince](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared&t=448). For most people, wearing the Stain Hat would have been alarming, as it caused corruption. But Shiori? She felt exactly the same. Even Nerissa, puzzled by how the corruption cure didn’t work on her, speculated, “Shiori’s already corrupted, but in a fun way.” Shiori, naturally, found this amusing and even entertained the idea of spreading the corruption, affectionately calling it “her children.”\n<br>\n\n[You can't fix what's not broken](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTf0g5tqzBU?si=RSHASwdQD5Os_E9z&amp;start=687)\n<br>\n\nDetermined to pursue her \"Happy Sugar Life,\" Shiori proposed to [Ina](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared&t=830), suggesting that Ina join her polycule so they could spread corruption together. However, Ina seemed less enthusiastic about the whole corruption thing and declined. That was one failed attempt—on to the next.\n<br>\n\n\nShiori later met Gonathon and learned about his heartbreak over Amelia Watson. Although she had once considered including him in her polycule, she chose to respect his loyalty and feelings. Instead, she gifted him a cherry sapling as a token of her [condolences](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared&t=1165).\n<br>\n\n\nNext, Shiori targeted [Nanamoo](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared&t=1889). She channeled all of her “rizz,” introducing herself as the Archiver of Hearts, whose mission was to archive relationships by marrying people. With all her charisma, she tried convincing the owl lady to join her polycule. But Nanamoo wasn’t interested in being a side chick—she wanted to be the main one. Feeling slighted, she declined and ran off. Another fail.\n<br>\n\n\nJust when Shiori thought her plans couldn’t get worse, Bijou—her wife—filed for divorce at Mori’s Tavern (see [Shiori-Bijou: Divorce No.1](#edge:shiori-nyavella-koseki-bijou-right-2-left-2)).\n<br>\n\nNow single, wifeless, and a single mother to a Stain child, Shiori went around the kingdom seeking sustenance to raise her “child.” Elizabeth and Mococo, moved by her story, gave her food. She eventually ended up in the onsen, contemplating how her dream of a \"Happy Sugar Life\" surrounded by women had instead left her alone, with no women and a child to care for.\n<br>\n\n[Please feed me and my child](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared&t=3309)\n<br>\n\n\nAs Shiori pondered her predicament, she realized she wasn’t entirely alone. She still had one woman by her side (see [Shiori-Nerissa: Always There](#edge:shiori-nyavella-nerissa-ravencroft-bottom-2-top-2)).\n<br>\n\n\nFinally, everyone was urgently summoned to the kingdom gates for one last battle against the Stain King. True to form, Shiori, ever the chill one, stood back and watched as the heroes faced the King head-on. But this time, the Stain King wasn’t leaving her out of the action.\n<br>\n\n[Nothing personal kid](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTf0g5tqzBU?si=vCsybv_p8YdnCMWU&amp;start=4968)\n<br>\n\n\nWhen the heroes finally bested the Stain King, they uncovered the painful truth about the ruler of Libestal (read [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n<br>\n\nAnd with that, everyone was returned to where their journey had first begun: the white box.

Everything was ready—only the sacred ritual remained, along with gifting the princess the \"cake\" to seize control of her mind.\n\n<br>\n\n\nPart of the ritual required the involvement of someone Cecilia considered an ally. Naturally, she stopped by FaunaMart to ask her green companion to fulfill that role. By chance, Amelia was also there, frantically searching for the \"diamonds\" she'd been obsessing over all day. Cecilia didn’t really understand what Amelia was on about but tried to help her [nonetheless](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=875). \n\n<br>\n\nNot long after, Gonathon and Ina approached Cecilia to ask if the library had any records of an ancient tale about a golden apple rumored to cure the \"corruption.\" Cecilia, not quite understanding why they needed it, recalled that the library did have the book, so she handed it over.\n<br>\n\n[A lot's happening, huh](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=1399)\n<br>\n\n\nOnly later, after receiving explanations from the others and seeing the corruption firsthand, did Cecilia start to grasp its nature. Instead of being scared or sad that her friends were succumbing to it, Cecilia was... upset. Upset that she still didn’t fully understand what was so bad about the corruption.\n<br>\n\nSure, it was destroying crops, which might be a problem, but it didn’t seem like the end of the world. More importantly, Koseki Bijou—the princess—was at the center of the corruption. This revelation threw a wrench into Cecilia’s plan. If the princess’s mind was already under the control of the stain on her head, Cecilia’s efforts to control her might be [pointless](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=2080).\n<br>\n\n\nStill, she pressed on. With Fauna's assistance, the ritual was completed, and the special cake needed for the plan was ready.\n\n<br>\n\n[Performing the ancient ritual](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/4co7VDSYTqU?si=QuTTkq8TrPrr-k4U&amp;start=3197)\n<br>\n\nWith time to spare, Cecilia decided to hang out with her friends. She shared more of her crackhead theory about the king with Nanamoo and Fauna, going on about how he was evil, yada yada yada, the usual [yap](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=3652). \n\n<br>\n\n\nFinally, the princess was cured. Cecilia met with her, preparing to execute the final step of her plan (for more details, see [Cecilia-Bijou: Mission Success?](#edge:koseki-bijou-cecilia-immergreen-right-2-bottom-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nDid it work? In Cecilia’s heart, it did, and that was all that mattered. Afterward, she helped others catch up with the final dungeon and prepared herself for the showdown. However, during this time, something strange occurred. Red text—similar to what she’d seen on day two—suddenly appeared in Cecilia’s mind. Strangely, Gonathon experienced the same phenomenon simultaneously. What could it mean? (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: Mysterious Messages](#edge:cecilia-immergreen-gonathon-g-bottom-1-right-3)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nFinally, the climactic battle arrived. Upon their [victory](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=8430), the heroes learned the cruel truth about the king (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)). Cecilia’s wild theory about the king being evil—the one many dismissed as nonsense—turned out to be true.\n\n<br>\n\n\nStill baffled by her own genius, Cecilia and the others were returned to the white box where their journey had begun. Should she be happy or sad that her theory was right? She wasn’t sure. After all, it was hard to tell whether she was a hero or a villain, considering her plan to control the princess’s mind. But that was a story for another time. For now, Cecilia wanted to enjoy her final moments with her guildmates—friends she’d bonded with throughout the journey—and Nanamoo, someone she’d only recently grown close to but felt deeply connected with.\n\n<br>\n\nBut as Cecilia called Nanamoo over for a group picture, she was met with a response that left her heart heavy (see [Cecilia-Nanamoo: Oh, she forgot...](#edge:moom-cecilia-immergreen-bottom-0-left-1)).\n\n",

The fields lay in ruin, fire and withered leaves painting a grim picture of corruption seeping through the kingdom. It was an ugly sight, and she had a strong suspicion about who was behind it all. Yet, to her surprise, Elizabeth and Calli believed she might have been the culprit. Thankfully, she was able to clear [her name](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=780).\n<br>\n\nWhile wandering the kingdom, she eventually came face-to-face with the suspected culprit—Koseki Bijou.\n<br>\n\n[What does \"Mpreg\" mean?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=961)\n<br>\n\nBijou was different. Ominous. The best way to describe her? Emo and chuuni. The gem princess revealed the truth—she had been corrupted and had joined the side of the Stains. Nerissa was taken aback, quickly declaring that this meant they were now enemies. But then, in a twist only fitting for her, the Stain Princess casually asked how to donate books to the library. \n<br>\n\nInstantly, Nerissa snapped into business mode, explaining the process like a seasoned employee. Corruption or not, business always came first (see [Bijou-Nerissa: Divorce No.3](#edge:nerissa-ravencroft-koseki-bijou-top-4-left-4)).\n<br>\n\nIt was quite the chaotic start to the final day, but fitting. And this was only the beginning.\n<br>\n\nFor days, Nerissa had speculated that the king was evil. She had voiced this theory to many, but few believed her. Still, she trusted her instincts. The blue maiden had always been upright and kind, and that wouldn't change now—not at the end. She was determined to protect those she loved and assist those she cared for. So, when Gonathon had opened up about his heartbreaking situation with Amelia Watson, Nerissa became the ultimate wingwoman for their story.\n<br>\n\n[Seaching for a diamond, right?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=2806)\n<br>\n\nThat said, kindness wasn't her only trait—she was also quite cunning. When she learned that she had been tricked by Nanamoo, she wasted no time devising an elaborate plan to trick the owl lady right back. (see [Nerissa-Fauna: My Money](#edge:ceres-fauna-nerissa-ravencroft-bottom-2-top-1))\n<br>\n\nThings were going… okay, all things considered. But the corruption was still spreading, and Nerissa saw it firsthand. Throughout the kingdom, everyone was desperately trying to stop it—Gonathon, Elizabeth, and many others. Some, like Ina, were even fighting to save their loved ones from falling to it.\n<br>\n\nNerissa wanted to stop the corruption, too. But fate had other plans.\n<br>\n\nIt got to her.\n<br>\n\nShe became part of Bijou’s Stain army.\n<br>\nBut only for a moment.\n<br>\nJust as she had helped others, she, too, was saved. A dashing knight in red—someone she had always had a complicated relationship with, yet who had always cared for her—pulled her from the pit of darkness (see [Nerissa-Elizabeth: Start Again](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-3-left-2)).\n<br>\nNow free from corruption, Nerissa wasted no time in [helping others](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=7467). She devised a clever trick—pretending to still be corrupted, donning the Stain Hat to lure others into Mori’s Tavern, where they could be trapped and cured. The plan worked perfectly. One by one, the corrupted were saved—Mococo, Fuwawa… but then there was Shiori.\n<br>\n\n[Corrupted in a fun way](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=7822)\n<br>\n\nShiori was a special case. Though she wore the Stain Hat, she showed no signs of corruption. Drinking the cure changed nothing—she felt exactly the same as before. Odd, but not entirely unexpected. After all, this was her wife. (see [Nerissa-Shiori: Always There](#edge:shiori-nyavella-nerissa-ravencroft-bottom-2-top-2)).\n<br>\nFinally, after saving Bijou, the corruption was over.\n<br>\nIt had been a long, grueling arc, but at last, everything was resolved. Nerissa set about cleaning up the ruined kingdom, taking some time to unwind in the casino and strolling around, enjoying the peace and the delightful chaos her friends continued to stir up. If anyone needed help, she was there.\n<br>\nAnd then… the [final battle](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=11577) arrived.\n<br>\nIt was tough. It was brutal. But with her trusty tuning fork and the other heroes by her side, they took down the Stain King. Victory, however, was short-lived.\n<br>\nJust as they celebrated, the truth about the King was revealed. (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n<br>\nNerissa’s theory had been right all along. And she was ecstatic about it.\n<br>\n\n[I was right!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=12299)\n<br>\n\nIn the end, everyone was brought back to the white room, marking the conclusion of their first journey. Nerissa went around exchanging hugs and farewells with those she had spent time with, capturing final commemorative photos with her guildmates.\n<br>\nIt had been a fun, unforgettable journey. And more awaited on the horizon.",

            "content": "The lands were burning. Grass, leaves, and plants withered as a dark atmosphere cloaked the kingdom. All of it stemmed from a single source: the Stain Princess, Koseki Bijou. Having rebelled against the king, her comrades, and everything she once stood for, Bijou surrendered herself entirely to darkness. And this was just the beginning. Soon, the kingdom, its people, and everything else would be under her rule.\n\n<br>\n\n[Corruption tour goes hard](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3MQlnSHfhA?si=2dtIYm0_FVJFB59D&amp;start=604)\n<br>\n\nShe stood amidst her masterpiece—a forest corrupted and stained, littered with flames. In the heart of this chaos, she constructed a small, ominous pillar adorned with four guild hats, surrounded by fire, with a sign that read: *\"FIRE FIRE LIGHT THE FIRE.\"* It was a grim warning to all who dared oppose her. Nearby, a moai statue wept blood, symbolizing the land’s despair under its false queen. The imagery was deliberate; Bijou sought to bring chaos and suffering.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile exploring the kingdom, Bijou stumbled upon an unusual sight. The kingdom’s gardens had been ravaged by famine, though not by her hand. Could she have an [ally](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=805), someone aligned with her chaotic vision? The idea amused her. Distracted momentarily, she indulged in a game of [chicken-catching](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=1182)—a brief respite from her descent into darkness.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHer amusement didn’t last long. Bijou then confronted the King, whom she mockingly addressed. Her words dripped with scorn and malice as she taunted him, painting vivid imagery of his downfall: his gates overrun by her stain army, his throne consumed by flames, and his ultimate demise at her hands.\n<br>\n\n[Your time is now, King](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=1297)\n<br>\n\nBijou’s ambition extended beyond destruction. She envisioned rewriting the kingdom’s history, replacing its library’s contents with her own twisted tales. As she pondered, flashes of memories surfaced—fragments of bonds forged during her journey. For a fleeting moment, her corrupted heart wavered. But she quickly dismissed those thoughts. Her former companions, comrades, even those she had shared moments of intimacy with, no longer mattered. Power was her sole focus now. Yet, in her solitude, an unshakable loneliness lingered.\n\n<br>\n\n[3AM chuuni speech](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3MQlnSHfhA?si=5ujXRmx4bgpcTv1c&amp;start=1757)\n<br>\n\nShe became a menace to the kingdom, whispering [demonic threats](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=2036) outside Calli’s tavern and tormenting others with the Stain upon her head, aptly named [\"Joe Mama\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=6121). Even in her chaos, she found time to write her \"spicy fics\", boasting about her corrupted literary works and her intention to plague the kingdom’s library with them. But Nerissa’s nagging about deadlines got under her skin, reminding Bijou of a time before corruption (see [Nerissa-Bijou: Divorce No.3](#edge:nerissa-ravencroft-koseki-bijou-top-4-left-4)).  \n\n<br>\n\n\nBijou’s suspicions of having allies proved correct. Slowly, Mococo, Fuwawa, Nerissa, and even Shiori succumbed to the corruption, joining her in wreaking havoc. However, her newfound power began unraveling when she faced her mother, Mario. Mario, heartbroken and in tears, begged Bijou to stop, only to be rejected.\n<br>\n\n[I'm sorry, mother](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=10794)\n<br>\n\n\nThe turning point came when Bijou confronted her sister, Ina. Ina vowed to save Bijou, even if it meant putting her down. Bijou scoffed at the notion but couldn’t deny that her allies were falling, one by one, cured of their corruption through trickery. Realizing she was being cornered, Bijou proposed a compromise: a duel with Ina. If Bijou won, she would corrupt everyone. If Ina won, Bijou would drink the cure. It was all or nothing (see [Bijou-Ina: Wooden Shovel](#edge:koseki-bijou-nino-ina-bottom-3-top-0)). \n\n<br>\n\nDespite her strength and cunning, Bijou couldn’t overcome Ina’s resolve. She lost the duel and was forced to drink the cure. The corruption left her, and for the first time in what felt like an eternity, Bijou was herself again.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe kingdom rejoiced. Mario’s tears of sorrow turned to joy as she embraced her daughter. Bijou, overwhelmed by emotion, thanked her friends and family for saving her. Her voice, raw with gratitude, carried the weight of her journey back to the light.\n<br>\n\n[I'm sorry for everything](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=12247)\n<br>\n\n\nAwakened with a clear mind, Bijou reflected on the dangers of losing herself to control, whether by corruption or others’ expectations. Determined to redefine herself, she severed ties with her superficial relationships, including Shiori, Hot Pink One, and Nerissa (see [Divorce No.1](#edge:shiori-nyavella-koseki-bijou-right-2-left-2), [No.2](#edge:koseki-bijou-hot-pink-one-bottom-2-top-2), and [No.3](#edge:nerissa-ravencroft-koseki-bijou-top-4-left-4)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nFinally, Bijou stood alongside her comrades for the final battle against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=15132). Channeling her fury at the corruption that had consumed her, she fought fiercely, her gemstones striking true. Though the battle was won, the heroes faced an unsettling revelation about the king’s true nature (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n\n<br>\n\nAnd then, everyone was brought back to the [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=16724), where everything began, and where this chapter closes.\n\n",

Gonathon was faced with two major challenges ahead of him: the looming final battle against the king and the escalating corruption wrought by the Stain Princess, Koseki Bijou. Things were already getting out of hands, early in the day, Nerissa informed him of the corruption spreading rapidly, leaving the kingdom’s fields ravaged. The sight was grim, but Gonathon resolved to put an end to it.\n<br>\n\n[The situation is dire](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=602)\n<br>\n\n\nBefore investigating further, he encountered Amelia Watson, who seemed... off. Her disheveled appearance, erratic behavior, and nonsensical ramblings about finding these [\"diamonds\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=727) unnerved him. \n<br>\n\nAt times, she even resorted to desperate, almost threatening behaviors like leaping off buildings. Concerned for her well-being, Gonathon [offered](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=1184) her diamonds to ease her anxiety and reassured her that things would be okay. Though hesitant, he asked Amelia to assist him in investigating the corruption, a task he thought fitting for the detective.\n<br>\n\n\nAs much as Gonathon wanted to spend more time with Amelia, there were more urgent matters. Gonathon confronted Bijou to set matters straight. During their exchange, he learned that the sentient entity on her head, named Joe Mama, played a critical role in her corruption. When he asked to touch [Joe Mama](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=1606), Bijou refused, heightening his suspicion. Gonathon then decided to follow the princess, sneakily, observing her actions from a distance.\n\n<br>\n\n[What could she be writing about...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/WvRIdaH107U?si=s2n4Umcp_5FxRL8p&amp;start=2535)\n<br>\n\nHe discovered Bijou writing a cryptic book, its contents likely meant to spread her corruption further. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Gonathon sought help from [Ina and Mario](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=4187). Together, they devised a plan to create the *Essence of Empathy*, an ancient cure for corruption. However, they still faced a challenging question: how could they get Bijou to drink it?\n\n<br>\n\n\nBefore they could act, tragedy struck again. Bijou’s influence spread to Fuwawa, who succumbed to the corruption. To make matters worse, the chickens Fuwawa had entrusted Gonathon to protect were slaughtered. Soon after, Nerissa, his companion throughout, fell to the corruption as well. Overwhelmed with guilt, Gonathon felt like a failure, his efforts seemed to have saved no one.\n\n<br>\n\n[It's my fault](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=6139)\n<br>\n\nWas this truly the end? No. He didn’t have to shoulder this burden alone. This wasn’t just his fight; his comrades—Ina, Elizabeth, and Calli—were there, preparing the cure. Together, they devised a daring plan: lure the corrupted ones into the tavern, trap them, and administer the Essence of Empathy.\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe plan was risky but [successful](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=7019). One by one, the corrupted were cured, and the kingdom slowly began to heal. Gonathon felt an immense weight lifted from his shoulders. His efforts had not been in vain.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWith peace beginning to return, Gonathon’s thoughts lingered on Amelia. Was she still obsessed with diamonds? His worry was interrupted by an urgent call from Ina, summoning him to address one final challenge—a test of his unwavering devotion to Amelia (see [Gonathon-Amelia: A Knight's Wish](#edge:gonathon-g-ame-top-2-bottom-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAnd then came the final battle. Everything had led to this moment. Gonathon, alongside the other heroes, faced the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=11048) in a grueling and merciless fight. Every blow he landed was fueled by his righteous spirit and his determination to protect his loved ones\n\n<br>\n\n\nVictory was hard-won, but celebration was short-lived. A cruel twist awaited the heroes, shaking them to their cores (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n<br>\n\n\nThe heroes were returned to the [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=12694), marking the conclusion of their first journey. Though the twist left everyone shaken, Gonathon chose to focus on spending his final moments with those who had been by his side.",

She couldn’t help but question the ominous Moai statue standing next to it—what was that about? Then, she finally found where everyone was: gathered around Mori’s Tavern. Excited to say hi, she joined the crowd.\n\n<br>\n\nSuddenly, chaos erupted.\n\n<br>\n\n[Hot Pink One incoming!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/pH9lSCrTVMY?si=x4Ho305cyuOfZiPj&amp;start=410)\n<br>\n“Take that hat off!”\n“Consort, take that hat off immediately!”\n<br>\n\nConfused, the Hot Pink One quickly realized that the Stain Hat she was wearing was the cause of everyone’s panic. Apparently, the hat had been corrupting others, just like how Bijou had been spreading her influence. However, the Hot Pink One felt no different at all. Gonathon, observing her calm demeanor, speculated that she was immune to corruption because she was \"full of empathy.\" Huzzah for her?\n\n<br>\n\n\nSpotting Nanamoo nearby, she went over to say hi and learned some exciting news: \"The Red One\" had been found somewhere in the kingdom. The Hot Pink One was eager to meet \"The Red One\", perhaps to expand her ever-growing circle of side chicks (see read [Hot Pink One-Peasant Da Bae: Pure Spite](#edge:peasant-da-bae-hot-pink-one-top-2-left-1)).\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nAfter watching a duel between Bijou and Ina in the [arena](https://www.youtube.com/live/pH9lSCrTVMY?feature=shared&t=1056), and witnessing the princess being cured, the Hot Pink One stumbled upon Amelia. The blonde maiden was frantically searching for her \"diamonds.\" Having heard the tale between Amelia and Gonathon, the Hot Pink One immediately knew what those \"diamonds\" were and felt a pang of sympathy for Amelia. But when the distressed maiden asked the Hot Pink One if she was the \"diamonds\" Amelia had been searching for, the pink lady’s response was utterly shocking (read [Hot Pink One-Amelia Watson: Non-Traditional Relation](#edge:ame-hot-pink-one-left-2-bottom-2)).\n<br>\n\n\nFollowing that incident, the Hot Pink One’s once-thriving circle of side chicks began to fall apart (see [Bijou-Hot Pink One: Divorce #2](#edge:koseki-bijou-hot-pink-one-bottom-2-top-2)). One by one, her three side chicks decided to break up with her, leaving her with only her eternal consort (see [Ina-Hot Pink One: Forever My Consort](#edge:hot-pink-one-nino-ina-right-2-left-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nAfter the [final showdown](https://www.youtube.com/live/pH9lSCrTVMY?feature=shared&t=4287), and learning about the kingdom's secrets (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)), everyone was returned to the white box, where their journey had first begun, the Hot Pink One took a moment to greet her guildmates and friends one last time.

Though the kingdom faced an imminent and perilous threat, nothing mattered more to her than her sister. As she wandered through the kingdom, she spotted her sister standing atop the bleeding moai statue. It was evident she had succumbed completely to the corruption.\n<br>\n\n\nIna approached, ready to plead for her sister’s return—but was interrupted by the ringing of Bijou's phone. With a sigh (laugh), she put the confrontation on hold to address a more pressing matter: planning a cure.\n<br>\n\n[She seems busy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=692)\n<br>\n\nGathering with Gonathon and Mario, Ina recalled the nursery rhymes from her childhood, tales of a magical golden apple capable of cleansing corruption. Gonathon suggested consulting the kingdom’s library for records of such an item, and they sought Cecilia’s help. It was during this discussion that Ina learned of her connection to Mario: Mario was her mother (see [Mario-Ina: Mother?](#edge:raora-panthera-nino-ina-right-1-left-1)).\n<br>\n\n\nThe group hurried to the library, where Cecilia unearthed a book with a cryptic clue pointing to the apple's location. It described the entrance as a \"fiery perishment where rebirth awaits.\" Ina recognized it immediately: the Volcanic Dungeon. Furthermore, they were also given a map of the location.\n\n<br>\n\n[Location of the Golden Apples](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdWqpuyH0Zg?si=Cg4nfvYiqUw5a_yx&amp;start=1256)\n<br>\n\nAlongside Mario, she journeyed to its entrance, where they found not one but [two golden apples](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=1718).\n<br>\n\n\nThe legends were true. Using the apples, Slime Jams, melon slices, and a bucket of milk, Ina crafted a remedy she called the [Essence of Empathy](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=2070)—a cure for the corruption.\n\n<br>\n\n\nHowever, the victory was short-lived. Mococo, Fuwawa, and Nerissa had also fallen to corruption, and Ina’s two potions wouldn’t suffice. As the group scrambled for alternatives, the tavern owner, Calli, stepped in to help. Her vast collection of exotic resources allowed her to replicate the cure, ensuring there was enough [for all](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=2619).\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe group devised a daring plan: they would use music to distract the corrupted ones, luring them into Calli’s tavern where they’d be trapped and forced to drink the cure. The plan was risky but worth the attempt.\n\n<br>\n\nTo their relief, it worked. One by one, the corrupted individuals were cured—until only the Stain Princess herself, Bijou, remained. The princess, too cunning to fall for their tricks, resisted with all her might. Knowing she was weakened, Ina proposed a duel: the loser would yield to the winner’s demand (see [Ina-Bijou: Wooden Shovel](#edge:koseki-bijou-nino-ina-bottom-3-top-0)).\n\n<br>\nThe battle was fierce and evenly matched, but Ina ultimately triumphed. Bijou, bound by their agreement, drank the cure. The corruption was vanquished at last.\n\n<br>\n\nThough the threat was gone, the heroes knew peace would be fleeting. Another challenge loomed on the horizon. But for now, Ina allowed herself to savor the moment—with her friends, comrades, family, and her delightfully chaotic wife (see [Ina-Hot Pink One: Forever My Consort](#edge:hot-pink-one-nino-ina-right-2-left-2)).\n\n<br>\n\n[How to even caption this](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdWqpuyH0Zg?si=aaRis0u8KSJBqAkw&amp;start=6494)\n<br>\n\nThe final battle with the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=7620) brought one last cruel twist (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)), sending the heroes back to the white room where their journey [began](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=9255).\n",

Now, they gathered once more, preparing for what could be their final battle. The fight ahead would be their most grueling yet, but they had come a long way—stronger, sharper, and more determined than ever.\n<br>\n\n[For the King!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=16622)\n<br>\n\nAs the battle against the Stain King commenced, the struggle was immense. Many heroes were knocked down, their strength tested to the absolute limit. But through sheer perseverance, through their unyielding bonds, they fought on—and at long last, they emerged victorious.\n<br>\n\nWith their greatest foe vanquished, the heroes erupted in celebration. More than anything, they couldn't wait to return to the King and deliver the joyous news—his kingdom was safe, the world saved from impending doom.\n<br>\n\nBut upon their return, an unthinkable sight awaited them.\n<br>\n\nThe kingdom was in ruins. Instead of cheering citizens and a land free from corruption, darkness had swallowed the city whole. Corruption ran rampant, covering buildings, twisting the streets into a nightmarish sight. Not a single citizen was in sight. It was a scene of wreckage and chaos.\n<br>\n\nShock took hold of the heroes, but before they could process what had happened, one by one, their guildmasters began to disappear. Each of them cried for help, but their voices were snuffed out into nothingness, vanishing into the void before anyone could react.\n<br>\n\nRushing toward the castle, the heroes desperately sought answers—was the King still safe?\n<br>\n\nThen, the King's chuckle echoed through the throne room.\n<br>\n\n[At long last...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=17220)\n<br>\n\nIt wasn’t a chuckle of relief or joy. It was mocking, twisted, and laced with malice. The truth came crashing down.\n<br>\n\nThe King had tricked them. This had all been part of his plan. The kingdom, the Stains, the war—it had all been a ruse. With the heroes’ victory, he had finally been “freed.”\n<br>\n\nNo longer bound by his shackles, the King revealed his true self. His small, kindly form twisted and contorted, warping into a hideous monstrosity wrapped in chains. *The Captive* had awakened.\n<br>\n\n[My vengeance is only beginning](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=12263)\n<br>\n\nWith chains wrapped around his body, The Captive lashed out. Chains cracked through the air, binding and battering the heroes. His strikes were relentless, his malice suffocating.\n<br>\n\nBut he had underestimated them. The heroes, burning with fury and betrayal, fought with everything they had. All seventeen of them, their combined power shaking the very ground. They struck him down. Blow after blow, they refused to let up.\n<br>\nAnd at last, The Captive fell…Or so they thought.\n<br>\nDespite its body crumbling, it refused to die. The chains still writhed, and the dark presence lingered. Before the heroes could react, a soft voice whispered into their minds.\n<br>\nIt was gentle yet urgent, pleading for them to leave. The kingdom was collapsing, and if they stayed, they would be swallowed by the darkness. This wasn’t the end, the voice assured them. There was more to come.\n<br>\nTrusting the voice, the heroes fled through the crumbling ruins. And then—\n<br>\n\n[This isn't the end](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=18165)\n<br>\n\nThey returned to the white room. The same place where it all began.\n<br>\nThus, the first tale in this enigmatic journey came to a close.",

            "content": "[\"Am I about to ride into chaos?\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=421) Yes, Gura, the answer is yes. Joining a bit later than the others on the final day, it was no surprise that she had missed nearly all the earlier events. Oddly enough, Gura had managed to avoid most of the major shenanigans throughout her journey, somehow always slipping past the chaos while everyone else got entangled. It explained why her perspective on the story remained remarkably peaceful—at least compared to the others.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe first thing Gura did upon regrouping with everyone was perform the Scarlet Wand ritual by [touching tips](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=456) with her guildmates. During this, she learned about Nanamoo’s secret: retaining all her memories from a past life. Gura warned her to be cautious, joking that she might get kidnapped and sold for ransom. As Nanamoo wandered off into the bushes, Gura couldn’t resist throwing in a witty remark.\n<br>\n\n[poopoo in the bush](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=1089)\n<br>\n\n\nGura then crossed paths with Amelia. Despite having rarely spoken to each other before, their interactions always seemed to convey an unusual closeness. Of course, their conversations often veered into questionable territory, like when Gura casually offered Amelia her [\"meat\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=733). Nevertheless, she wished the blonde maiden good luck in her search for her \"diamonds.\"\n\n<br>\n\n\nRealizing that time was running out—only 15 minutes left until the end of the world—Gura rushed to finish her quests and dungeons. In her hurry, she accidentally [ignored](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=1525) Mococo, who had been trying to start a conversation.\n\n<br>\n\n\nShe made it back to the kingdom with five minutes to spare, only to find everything in flames and flooded. Typical. Apologizing to [Mococo](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=3487) for brushing her off earlier, Gura then shouted to the sky, complaining that the end of the world seemed to be running [late](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=3720) (more than five minutes had passed by then).\n\n<br>\n\n\nFinally, the end came. As the final battle against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=3994) began, Gura weaved through the chaos, swinging her trident with precision. Chanting her Revelation, she unleashed powerful waves of water against her target. Amid the screams and screeches, she persevered, fighting alongside her comrades, until they emerged victorious.\n\n<br>\n\n\nBut then came the most unexpected twist. The biggest revelation yet unfolded, shedding light on the king’s true intentions (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).\n\n<br>\n\n\nStill baffled and processing the truth, Gura and everyone else were sent back to the white box, the starting point of their journey. Ever the mischievous one, Gura noticed she still had her Warp Crystal. Using it, she managed to sneak back into the kingdom, where she wasn’t supposed to be.\n<br>\n\n[\"Try me now, God!\"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIb5yHw4mvk?si=FITNRJQKzyv96_MJ&amp;start=5708)\n<br>\n\nOf course, the gods caught her in no time and promptly returned her to the white room with the others. Once there, Gura reunited with her fellow Scarlet Wand members for one last group tip-touching session. And so, the curtain fell on the first chapter of her enigmatic journey.\n\n",

            "content": "Gonathon was worried sick when he stumbled upon his former companion, Amelia, frantically searching for the “diamonds” she had lost. It didn’t help that the kingdom was in utter chaos, corruption spreading like wildfire. He feared that her very identity was being torn apart—caught between his Pearl, the woman he once knew, and Amelia Watson, the detective she had become. As much as he longed to stay by her side, he had more pressing matters to attend to, and he respected her path, choosing instead to watch from the sidelines.\n<br>\nAnd yet, reality painted a different picture.\n<br>\n\nTime and time again, by pure chance, Gonathon found himself near Amelia throughout the day. He would overhear her private [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=1184) with the King, stumble upon her while she was interrogating [Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=1504), and even catch her reading [A Knight’s Tale](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=3315)—a book he had poured his heart and soul into. Amelia even stalked him, for god’s sake. It was as if the universe itself was trying to tell him something, whispering that perhaps, just perhaps, there was still a chance for them to walk hand in hand once more.\n<br>\n\n[Can I help you?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=6574)\n<br>\n\nHe gave the blonde another book he'd quickly written down, hoping it'd remind her of something, anything.\n<br>\n\nWhether this wish of his was genuine or just a fleeting moment of longing, he would soon find out.\n<br>\n\n[A Knight's Wish](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=9475)\n<br>\n\nAfter the corruption had been vanquished, while helping others rebuild, Gonathon received an urgent call from Ina, requesting his presence immediately. When he arrived, he was met with a gut-wrenching sight—the Hot Pink One had deceived Amelia, twisting reality to make the detective believe she was wedded to her.\n<br>\n\nGonathon was torn. He had told himself before that he would respect Amelia’s choices, no matter the path she chose. But this—this was simply not right. Something within him stirred, an ember that had refused to die despite all the hardships he had endured. He was still in love with his Pearl. And he wanted her back. Justice had to be served.\n<br>\n\n[You dare betray me?!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=8758)\n<br>\n\n\nAnd as if the universe had answered his plea, the Hot Pink One was punished for her deception, and Amelia was freed from her grasp (see [Hot Pink One-Amelia: Non-Traditional Relation](#edge:ame-hot-pink-one-left-2-bottom-2)). Gonathon wasted no time. He pulled Amelia aside, his voice firm yet earnest, telling her not to trust the pink woman, hoping—praying—that she would trust him instead.\n<br>\n\nThen, the wheels began to turn.\n<br>\n\nHints and signs flooded Amelia’s path, coming from everyone she met (see [Amelia’s POV](#node:ame), all leading her to a single revelation—the diamond she had been searching for all this time had been right in front of her. The knight in orange. And with one final push from Nerissa, urging her to meet Gonathon at the onsen, the long-awaited reunion finally arrived.\n<br>\n\nGonathon laid his heart bare.\n<br>\n\n[We were once entangled](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=10312)\n<br>\n\nHe spoke of their adventures, their bonds, the moments they had shared. He told her everything he had been holding in for so long, his words raw with emotion. He wished to be with her once more—to experience those moments again, to reclaim what they had lost.\n<br>\n\nAmelia, skeptical at first—after all, she had been deceived before—slowly allowed herself to trust his words. The diamonds she held sang in resonance, glowing in response to the sincerity Gonathon displayed. And though she still could not remember everything, she wanted to. Or rather—she wanted to start again. To live that life once more. With him.\n<br>\n\nBut there was one final test.\n<br>\n\nShe would see it through the last battle against the Stain King. She would watch Gonathon fight, witness his might, his unwavering will. And through that, she would decide if his words were truly honest.\n<br>\n\nAnd so, Gonathon fought—not just for himself, but for his friends, for what was right, for his ideals, for her.\n<br>\n\nAnd in the end, he emerged victorious.\n<br>\n\nAt long last, the two were reunited, finally able to spend the moments they had yearned for, the moments they had been cruelly robbed of. It was a love story—one of beauty and emotion, of hardships and triumphs.\n<br>\n\n[Together, at last. Huzzah!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=12776)\n<br>\n\nFrom enemies to lovers. From opposition to unity.\n\nGonathon, the ever-loyal husband.

As a knight, she bore the burden of protecting others, standing as their shield, being there when they needed her most. Caring for those she loved wasn’t just an instinct—it was her duty.\n<br>\n\nBut at the same time, being a knight meant upholding virtue, standing for righteousness, and banishing all that was wrong.\n<br>\n\nSo when those two ideals clashed—when duty to a loved one contradicted duty to justice—what was the right choice?\n<br>\n\nThat was the dilemma Elizabeth faced on this final day.\n<br>\n\n[You wish to call me sister now?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=10236)\n<br>\n\nMococo, someone she had sworn to protect, someone she had promised to always stand by, had succumbed to corruption. She was spreading chaos throughout the kingdom—an undeniable act of evil. Elizabeth tried to stop her. She tried to reason with her. But Mococo wouldn't listen. Wouldn’t—or couldn’t—[stop](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=10033).\n<br>\n\nAnd when Mococo pleaded, begged, insisted that it wasn’t her, that she wasn’t the one doing all these horrible things… Elizabeth had no choice but to reject her.\n<br>\n\nAnd in doing so, she broke the promise she had made on the very first day.\n<br>\n\nIt was heart-wrenching—for both of them. Mococo, who had always been terrified of being alone, now found herself more alone than ever. Feared. Avoided. Even abandoned by the person she trusted most.\n<br>\n \nAnd Elizabeth? She did what a knight should do. She upheld righteousness. She made the *right* choice. So why did it hurt so much? Why did it feel like she had just shattered something irreplaceable?\n<br>\n\nShe had cut ties with someone who had looked up to her. Someone who had seen her as a big sister. Someone she had sworn to protect. But in this moment, it felt like she had done the opposite.\n<br>\n\nEven so, Elizabeth refused to let things end like this. She believed in redemption—not just for Mococo, but for herself as well.\n<br>\n\nAnd with sheer determination—and the help of her comrades—they found the cure to the corruption. Through an elaborate plan, they freed those who had been afflicted, including Mococo. And at last, the two were reunited.\n<br>\n\n[I'm sorry for what I've said](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=12661)\n<br>\n\nElizabeth apologized—apologized for the harsh words she had spoken, for abandoning her in her darkest moment. Yes, she had done what many knights should have done. But just because something was *just*, didn’t mean it was the only path.\n<br>\n\nShe had learned something that day—something far more important than chivalry or duty. That being a knight wasn’t about following rigid orders. It wasn’t about doing what was expected of her.\n<br>\n\nIt was about following her heart. It was about fighting—not just for justice, but for the people she loved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She had seen firsthand how much of a nutcase this woman was—flirting with every girl in sight, collecting wives like trinkets, and basking in her ever-growing harem. Ina didn’t comment much. She had accepted it as just another part of her consort’s chaotic nature.\n<br>\n\nBut what Ina didn’t expect… was just how low this pink menace was willing to go. Even tricking someone who was heartbroken—taking advantage of a vulnerable soul who had already lost so much.\n<br>\n\n[Eternal Consort! Oi!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=5210)\n<br>\n\nUpon meeting Amelia Watson, the Hot Pink One did the unthinkable. She lied. She tricked the blonde into believing that she was the one who had given her all those diamonds during their first meeting, that she was the one Amelia had been searching for all this time. \n<br>\n\nIna, watching this horror unfold before her very eyes, immediately tried to stop her wife. Flirting? Sure. Womanizing? Expected. But this? This was crossing the line. And to make matters worse, as the Pink One tried to brainwash Amelia, she threw out words that stung more than any dagger. How Amelia was “special” to her. Despite the eternal vows she had already sworn to Ina.\n<br>\n\nIna couldn’t take it. She left, sad and hurt. But karma came quickly. Her sister, Bijou, had been informed everything, and she was not happy. The moment she found out her sister had been made to cry, Bijou confronted the pink menace. And suddenly, the Hot Pink One backpedaled. The confident womanizer was gone. She frantically declared that Amelia was merely a fling—just a momentary distraction, and begged for Ina’s forgiveness. Ina being the empathetic soul that she was, forgave her silly wife.\n<br>\n\nBecause, despite everything, love is love. And so, the two shared a dinner date at Mori’s tavern, exchanging sweet words over delicious food, as if nothing had ever happened. \n<br>\n\n[The world lights up with you](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=5981)\n<br>\n\nIna, the sweetest, kindest, and most normal person in the entire kingdom, had somehow found a way to put up with the silliest, most unpredictable one. But maybe that’s just how love worked. And despite the minor setback, they walked through their journey hand in hand, sticking together till the [very end](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=9492).\n\n",

They had shared plenty of lovey-dovey moments, and despite their quirky antics, their relationship had seemed relatively solid.\n<br>\n\nBut after being freed from the control of corruption, Bijou realized just how terrible it was to be chained to and controlled by something—or someone—else. She had no intention of ever experiencing that again. So, she decided she would sever every relationship chain that bound her. And the first step? Divorcing Shiori.\n<br>\n\n[You deadbeat father](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=13345)\n<br>\n\nShiori was stunned. Throughout their entire journey together, she had done nothing wrong. She had simply gone with the flow, chill and understanding as always. And yet, now here was Bijou, tossing her aside like she was some item to be picked up and discarded at will.\n<br>\n\nSo, naturally, Shiori wasn’t about to go down without a fight. Spiteful? Maybe. But deserved? Absolutely.\n<br>\n\nIf Bijou wanted a divorce, fine. But Shiori wasn’t letting her walk away without taking a chunk out of her wallet first. She demanded the most expensive item on the menu at the divorce tavern as compensation, and Bijou—now financially crippled—was forced to pay up.\n<br>\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, Shiori also declared Bijou a deadbeat father for abandoning her and the “child” they had together—leaving Shiori to raise it alone. She was not happy, and honestly, it was understandable.\n<br>\n\nStill, the breakup was final, and Bijou had two more marriages left to end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

She sympathized with the poor knight, never expecting such a beautiful love story to take such a [tragic turn](#out:https://x.com/irys_en/status/1831979038820450676). She wished him nothing but the best and, as his guildmate, resolved to support him however she could. If there was anything she could do, it was to keep her head cool, be there for Gonathon if he ever needed help, and, if it would make him happy, even extend that help to Amelia.\n<br>\n\nAt the same time, she reflected on her own relationship with her eternal consort, determined to cherish it and avoid meeting such a sorrowful fate.\n<br>\n\nYeah, she totally should do that.\n<br>\n\nOr at least, she was trying to—until she met Amelia.\n<br>\n\nIt started out harmless, but then the blonde pointed out something peculiar: the Pink One’s hat reminded her of someone. And that was when it snapped—the pink lady's old tendencies resurfaced.\n<br>\n\n[I was your *\"backup plan\"*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/pH9lSCrTVMY?feature=shared&t=1792)\n<br>\n\nSeizing the perfect opportunity, the Pink One took advantage of Amelia’s fragmented memories, spinning a web of deception. She tricked the blonde into believing that she was her beloved—not Gonathon. To the Hot Pink One’s delight—and to Ina’s absolute horror—Amelia believed her.\n<br>\n\nThings escalated when Gonathon arrived. With no hesitation, the Pink One boldly declared to his face that Amelia was her Pearl, and the knight in orange was furious.\n<br>\n\nIt was truly an act of villainy—something no one would expect from a supposed beacon of empathy, and yet, it was so in character for the Hot Pink One. For a moment, she basked in her self-proclaimed victory.\n<br>\n\nAnd then—everything came crashing down.\n<br>\n\nShiori happened to stumble upon the scene, and with a mischievous smirk, she [exposed](https://www.youtube.com/live/pH9lSCrTVMY?feature=shared&t=2059) the Pink One, revealing that she had been entangled in multiple affairs at the same time. That was the beginning of the end.\n<br>\n\nAmelia’s trust in the pink woman wavered. She studied her diamond, frowning as she murmured that it felt foggy and impure. Doubt took root, and realization struck—she had been tricked. The moment she understood the truth, she broke free from the Pink One’s grasp.\n<br>\n\nNot only that, Ina and Bijou soon joined in, confronting the Pink One for her betrayal. The confrontation erupted into a full-blown spectacle, drawing the attention of the entire kingdom.\n<br>\n\nCaught red-handed and with no way out, the Pink One was left frantically apologizing to everyone, scrambling to salvage what little dignity she had left. It was like a scene ripped straight from a drama movie—except this time, she was the antagonist getting her long-overdue karma.\n",

Between trying to stop the corruption, mending Gonathon and Amelia’s relationship, assisting FaunaMart, and collecting Bijou’s books, she barely had a moment to breathe. Meanwhile, Shiori—who arguably had more free time than anyone else—wasn’t the type to actively seek interaction. She simply drifted around aimlessly until she bumped into someone, only then engaging in conversation.\n<br>\n\nTheir circumstances couldn’t have been more different, yet whenever they crossed paths, they always seemed to bounce off each other effortlessly.\n\n<br>\n\n[It's not the shield hero](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared&t=1776)\n<br>\n\nTo Shiori, Nerissa was just another person—aside from their unofficial bond of marriage, she saw her as just some woman who really liked talking to other women. \n<br>\nMeanwhile, Nerissa viewed Shiori as that crazy lady—not in a bad way, though. She had long since grown accustomed to Shiori’s antics. Sometimes, the Oreo woman would spout the most outrageous things, and Nerissa wouldn’t even blink (well, most of the time). And when she noticed that the Stain failed to corrupt Shiori, she barely gave it a second thought, simply assuming Shiori had already been corrupted—just in a [fun way](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared&t=731).\n<br>\n\nOut of everyone in the kingdom, Nerissa was one of the few who could handle Shiori’s shenanigans like second nature. And for good reason—she genuinely cared about her. Sure, Nerissa was kind by nature, but her bond with Shiori was something different, something special. In fact, their lovey-dovey relationship was probably one of the most stable and unshaken in the entire kingdom.\n<br>\n\nSo when Shiori found herself contemplating her fate—staring down the daunting reality of raising a child as a single mother with barely any resources—Nerissa stepped in without hesitation, offering her everything she needed.\n<br>\n\n[Oh she is rich!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared&t=3740)\n<br>\n\nSome might argue that Nerissa was only doing it to get Shiori out of the way so Gonathon and Amelia could have their reunion in peace. But even if that moment had never happened, there was no doubt she would have done the same thing regardless.\n<br>\n\nAfter all, they were technically the first to be wedded. And through all the chaos, all the absurdity, they remained together until the very last day, without a single hitch in between.\n<br>\n\nBecause a relationship like that could only exist between two people who truly cared for each other.\n\n\n\n",

Amidst the kingdom’s chaotic struggle against the spreading corruption, the two still found time to try and one-up each other. Well—mostly Elizabeth, as the red knight simply couldn’t let Nerissa take all the credit for being Gonathon’s [wingman](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=8905).\n<br>\n\nThe moment was lighthearted, a much-needed contrast to the grim atmosphere looming over the kingdom. To Elizabeth, Nerissa was an important companion. Sure, she had accused the blue maiden of being a witch countless times, and yes, that so-called witch had given her plenty of headaches, but in the end, Elizabeth still valued her. \n<br>\n\nHowever, no matter how deep their connection was, the scarlet knight would never put Nerissa above her King. When Nerissa spewed her wild theories about the King being corrupted, Elizabeth dismissed them outright, claiming that even if it were true, she would still serve him without hesitation.\n<br>\n\n[I shall follow him either way](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=6832)\n<br>\n\nAnd yet, despite what she said, her knightly heart and her innate sense of justice told a different story. Nerissa, without a doubt, was one of Elizabeth’s closest companions—far more so than the King himself. Witch or not, delusional or not, the scarlet knight would never stand idly by if her companion was in danger.\n<br>\n\nAnd on this day, that truth was put to the test.\n<br>\n\nAs the corruption spread, consuming everything in its path, Elizabeth discovered that Nerissa had succumbed to it. But rather than recoiling in fear or condemning her, Elizabeth did something unexpected—she confronted Nerissa directly, taking her by the hand and dragging her into Mori’s tavern. She refused to give up on the blue maiden, believing that no matter how far she had fallen, it was never too late. The kindness within her was still there, buried beneath the corruption. And if there was even a sliver of a chance to save her, Elizabeth would take it.\n<br>\n\n[Let us start again](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=12224)\n<br>\n\nWith determination and effort, the corruption was finally defeated, and Nerissa was brought back to her usual self. And just like that, they were back to their antics again. To commemorate the occasion, Nerissa gifted Elizabeth some books titled \"Nerissa Ravencroft x Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame\". Just from the name alone, it was obvious how Elizabeth would [react](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=15714).\n<br>\n\nEven as the journey came to an end, the two remained inseparable, constantly flocking to each other, locked in their endless [banter](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=19277). Their relationship was odd, chaotic, and utterly unique—but it was beautiful all the same. And surely, the future held even more for them.\n<br>\n\n[\"How to Woo a Witch 101\" by Keisea](#out:https://x.com/Keiseeaaa/status/1832856628850491716)\n\n\n\n\n",

            "content": "Nerissa would do anything to help her boss. Well… almost anything. She managed the shop, handled advertising, gathered books for the library—whatever Fauna needed, she was there. But the moment something involved her wealth? That was where she drew the line.\n<br>\n\nOver the past few days, Nerissa had worked tirelessly, climbing her way to the top and earning her place as the richest person in the kingdom. Not because she needed to spend the money on anything—she simply enjoyed the feeling of having deep pockets. But with great wealth came great problems.\n<br>\n\nCase in point: the previous day, she had bought a lottery ticket from NanaEleven. And now, the brown shop owner was demanding 50% of her earnings as payment.\n<br>\n\nTo avoid such an unfair predicament, Nerissa devised a clever plan. She would distribute her money among trusted individuals, making it appear as though she didn’t have much left. Once Nanamoo collected her so-called \"cut,\" Nerissa would retrieve her money, and all would be well. A perfect plan.\n<br>\n\nShe turned to the two people she [trusted most](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=4129). Fauna, her boss, received 25,000 coins, while Cecilia got 5,000. And just as planned, when Nanamoo came to collect, she was tricked into believing Nerissa only had a mere 1,000 coins. She walked away with very little. Victory.\n<br>\n\nBut just as Nerissa was about to retrieve her money, something unexpected happened.\n<br>\n\n[She tried to use my money!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=5037)\n<br>\n\nFauna, out of nowhere, decided to buy NanaEleven from Nanamoo—offering up all the money Nerissa had given her.\n<br>\n\nNerissa stood there, frozen in disbelief. \n<br>\nThat was her money. Money she had shed sweat and blood for. And Fauna was about to hand it over to the very person who had just been scamming her?\n<br>\nBefore she could even protest, Nanamoo swiftly rejected the offer, much to Nerissa’s relief. But she wasn’t taking any more chances. Before her boss could come up with any more bold ideas, Nerissa immediately stepped in, reclaimed her money, and bolted—laughing at Fauna for the first time at the sheer ridiculousness of the stunt she'd had just tried to pull.\n<br>\n\nShe still loved her boss, though, so it was no biggie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So, being the crafty gem she was, she tricked Gonathon into covering the fee, saying it was for this thing called [\"Bijou Tax\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=13948).\n<br>\n\nAnd so, with the price [paid](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=14099), Bijou was officially freed from her second chain of marriage.

Cecilia recalled experiencing similar messages back on the second day. But what did they mean? Who was sending them? Forget what? What allegiance? And why, of all people, were they the only ones receiving these messages?\n\n<br>\n\nWith time running out, the two independently began theorizing, trying to decipher the clues before the battle.

And sure enough, they found something.\n<br>\n\nWithin a hidden chest in both bases lay three diamonds—and a book, which read:\n<br>\n\"Do not forget.\"\n<br>\n\"What you have lost.\"\n<br>\n...Great. That told them absolutely nothing.\n<br>\nWith no time to discuss further, they left it as it was. But the fact remained—something was being hidden.

She had to do something about it.\n<br>\n\nAfter Nerissa temporarily entrusted Fauna with 25,000 coins, telling her she could spend \"some of it\" if needed, an idea sparked in Fauna's mind. She [summoned](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=920) NanaMoo, the owner of NanaEleven, to the third floor of the library, where she intended to propose what could only be described as the Deal of the Century.\n<br>\n\n[Our businesses together](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=1082)\n<br>\n\nIn her best Godfather tone, Fauna addressed the brown entrepreneur, recounting their past, their relationship, and the business conflict now standing between them. NanaMoo listened, but her expression made it clear—she had no idea what Fauna was rambling about. Then, the green CEO made her move. To resolve their rivalry and \"help\" them both prosper, she proposed merging NanaEleven with FaunaMart—offering a hefty sum of 55,000 coins in exchange.\n<br>\n\nNanaMoo, unimpressed, scoffed. \"You take me for a fool?\" she retorted mockingly, making it clear that 55,000 coins were mere pocket change to NanaEleven. Not only did she reject the offer outright, but she also exposed the truth—Fauna wasn’t even using her own money; it was Nerissa’s.\n<br>\n\n[*Gasps dramatically*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=1263)\n<br>\n\nFauna's plan was crumbling fast. She was being backed into a corner, her carefully laid-out scheme unraveling before her eyes. But then, something unexpected happened.\n<br>\n\nInstead of ridiculing Fauna further, NanaMoo revealed her true intentions for opening NanaEleven. It was never about competing—it was about ensuring FaunaMart's survival. She knew FaunaMart was a scam, and that people would never support such a business. Without customers, Fauna’s dream of building a library would remain just that—a dream. So NanaEleven was born, acting as the bright, honest alternative that the people could trust. By gaining their support and amassing funds, NanaEleven was, in truth, securing FaunaMart’s future. It was an elaborate plan—and it had worked flawlessly.\n<br>\n\n[It was always for the library](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=1516)\n<br>\n\nFauna was speechless. Moved. Her respect for the brown maiden soared higher than ever, and her vision grew clearer—she now saw a world where every corner held a FaunaMart and a NanaEleven, side by side. With NanaMoo by her side, the future had never looked brighter.\n<br>\n\n[Give us 10% of your income](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=1970)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The smugness in her expression, the way she kept referring to Bae as “Peasant.” And worst of all? The boasting. This woman had so many wives. And she never shut up about it.\n<br>\n\n[You really have five wives?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5NGryTaGqk&t=2169s)\n<br>\n\nAt first, Bae wanted nothing to do with her. But after enduring enough, she decided—no, she vowed—to make this pink menace suffer. For the rest of the day, Bae dedicated herself to being as [annoying](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=3285) as humanly possible.\n<br>\nMocking her in front of others, trying to steal her so-called \"eternal consort\", throwing shade at every opportunity. Bae had every right to do so. She had nothing to lose. And every bit of it was delicious.\n<br>\n\n[You're the stain of my life](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=4918)\n",

            "content": "This strange owl friend Cecilia had made was… well, strange. But not in a bad way. She had a habit of giggling evilly for no reason, opened up a shop only to give everything away for free, liked pretending she was part of the Scarlet Wand guild (even though she wasn’t), and rambled about how she didn’t have amnesia—claiming instead that she remembered her past life where she was \"cool, had tons of friends, and drove a Ferrari.\" She was an oddball, to say the least. Yet, despite all of that, Cecilia had grown attached to her—like an odd little sister she found herself wanting to protect.\n\n<br>\n\nThroughout the last day, Cecilia was always keeping an eye out for [Nanamoo](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=2207). Whether it was checking in on whatever trouble she was getting into, making sure she was up to date on current events, or simply seeing what she was doing—it was a constant. Just the day before, she had frequently asked about how Nanamoo’s business was doing. Unlike many of Cecilia’s other relationships, which she maintained partly for her own ulterior motives, this bond was different. This was one she had nurtured, one she had come to genuinely appreciate.\n<br>\n\nAnd it was nice. For both of them. A green knight and her silly bird friend.\n<br>\n\n[Do you want me to braid your hair?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=5935)\n<br>\n\nEven during the final battle against the corrupted King, Cecilia kept looking out for her. And when the dust settled, getting back to where everything began, everyone gathered with their respective guilds to take final commemorative pictures. Though Nanamoo wasn’t technically a member of Scarlet Wand, in Cecilia’s heart, she was.\n<br>\n\nSo, without hesitation, Cecilia called Nanamoo over for the picture.\n<br>\n\n...Except, the response she received wasn’t what she was expecting.\n<br>\n\n[...Did you hit your head again?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=9919)\n<br>\n\nInstead of an excited answer or a teasing remark, she was met with confused words.\n<br>\n\n\"Who? What? Where?\"\n<br>\n\nAt first, Cecilia was taken aback. But then, realization dawned on her.\n<br>\n\nNanamoo had forgotten about everthing.\n<br>\n\nThe adventures they had shared. The bonds they had built. The time they had spent together.\n<br>\n\nThe moment was brief, and Cecilia didn’t want to spoil the atmosphere for everyone, so she kept quiet about it, maintaining her usual bright demeanor. But deep down, she was hurting. It was an ache she couldn't ignore. \n<br>\n\nAt the very least, this wouldn’t be the last time they interacted. Maybe, in time, Nanamoo would recover her memories. Maybe they could rebuild what was lost.\n<br>\n\nBut still—right now, in this moment—it hurt.\n<br>\n\n[\"She forgot...\" by Medu](#out:https://x.com/Medu_Yusa/status/1832886978574234063)\n<br>\n\n[\"she's a professional after all\" by Ammy](#out:https://x.com/Ammiietty/status/1832638322503463219)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
