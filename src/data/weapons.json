    "content": "### <u>Description</u> \n**Violet Miasma** takes the form of a book — but not just any ordinary one. This tome radiates an eerie, mysterious aura, thanks to its deep purple cover, orange binding, and most strikingly, the ancient scripture etched across its surface. Despite its ominous appearance, its wielder, Ninomae Inanis, is anything but intimidating — exuding more comfy, cozy cuteness than menace.\n\n### <u>Ability and Story</u> \nIna serves as a priestess to the enigmatic Ancient Ones, and this very book, tied to those beings, is the source of her power. Though its potential is vast and terrifying, Ina has always wielded it with kindness and restraint, using it solely against evil — unlike a few of her more *questionable* companions.\n\nWhen activated, a swirling purple cloud materializes above her, firing piercing shots in the direction Ina aims. These projectiles pass through multiple enemies, dealing damage in their wake — a beautiful, eerie display of ancient might in the hands of someone so unexpectedly gentle.\n\n[Firing my lasers!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/THllQCVOYzY?si=6WRNsqGVEFR4DDPO&t=4464)\n",

Naturally, it only makes sense for her to rely on her magnifying glass for her detective work.\n\nWhen activated, the glass emits a radial AoE pulse around Ame, applying a defense and slow debuff to any enemies caught in its range.
