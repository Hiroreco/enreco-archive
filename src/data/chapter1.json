      "dayRecap": "## Day 1: The Chains of Employment\nThe kingdom of Libestal has returned—but something is… off. Our heroes have traveled back in time?! As if the whole “the King was evil and the old kingdom was a fabricated illusion” twist wasn’t enough, now we’ve got *time travel* thrown into the mix. But alright, maybe it’s not so bad, they just need t—oh, they’ve also lost their memories. Again???\n\nForget the bonds, the connections, the whole history they’d built up—our heroes now begin anew. A new kingdom, new lives, even new identities. But one thing hasn’t changed: their mission to recover their shattered memories and, somehow, save the world—no, the *universe*—from calamity. The King, now known as the Outsider, still seeks its end.\n\nThe (new? old?) kingdom of Libestal also brings new systems for the heroes to learn. Guilds are gone, replaced by *Jobs*, and each hero is free to choose the path they wish to walk:\n\n* **The Smith:** Crafts upgrade stones used to enhance Revelation Weapons.\n* **The Jeweler:** Crafts charms that boost health and defense.\n* **The Chef:** Cooks meals that grant adventuring buffs.\n* **The Supplier:** Enchants tools, improving resource gathering.\n\n![The job selection area](/images-opt/jobs.webp)\n\nThe kingdom itself has undergone a makeover too. With a strong wooden motif, it carries a distinctly medieval vibe. No tyrannical King this time—replacing him is Princess Iphania, the current ruler. Alongside her is a mysterious talking cat named Fia, who manages a place known as the *Library*.\n\nThe Library holds the memories of everything, and it's now tended by lorekeepers Calli and Kiara, who work with Fia to archive the new stories our heroes will forge. At the end of each day, everyone is expected to write a diary entry of their journey and submit it to the Library.\n\n![The Library with Fia](/images-opt/library.webp)\n\nHow will any of this help save the universe? Who knows. But it's only Day 1—the start of a new adventure, a chance to forge new bonds and rediscover old ones. Forget world-saving for now. First, our heroes need to get a grip on their new lives and roles… because before anything else, they need to *pay the bills*.\n\n[Monster - ENigmatic Recollection Chapter 2 Theme Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUrITFpI85A&ab_channel=hololiveEnglish)",

            "content": "The fluffy one’s beginning mirrored that of all the others—she was given the rundown of her situation, her mission, and the state she was in: missing a piece of her memories (see [Fia](#node:fia) and [Princess Iphania](#node:princess-iphania)). She was understandably confused, but, as always, she faced her new reality with quiet resolve. Just like in her past journey, she accepted her role and duties without hesitation.\n\nWhen asked to choose an occupation, Fuwawa became a chef. Her reason was simple and heartfelt: she wanted to bring people together through food, to create joyful moments with her cooking—a touching motive that fit her perfectly.\n\n[Fluffy food for everyone](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/-zBlbI-EuCw?si=nzN8c0Pw0-r-m8IK&t=1696)\n\nAnd so her new adventure began. Thanks to the familiarity of the kingdom’s mechanics from her previous life, the fluffy one had a much easier time settling into this strange, yet oddly familiar world. Along the way, she encountered old acquaintances—or perhaps new ones? With her memories fragmented, she couldn’t be sure. She remembered her beloved bread lady, [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/-zBlbI-EuCw?si=wV_c4zN2N9MCFymM&t=5394), but drew a blank on the striking blue maiden before her. So she gave her a name of her own:\n\n[Miss Mustard](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zBlbI-EuCw&t=3399s\n)\n\nThen came the cooking. She was a chef, after all. From soups to potato salads, Fuwawa happily prepared meal after meal. It quickly became clear she had made the right decision—cooking was easy, fun, and most importantly, fulfilling.\n\nShe spent time exploring the kingdom, inspecting the [kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zBlbI-EuCw&t=8953s\n) she would come to know well, and even visited the gallery where she stumbled upon a nostalgic painting of herself from a past she could still recall.\n\n[The chickens...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/-zBlbI-EuCw?si=EsVMxO7nW5FLNBdj&t=9049)\n\nAs the day came to a close, the doggo continued doing what she loved. She even attempted to bake a cake—though that endeavor didn’t go quite as planned, and she ultimately gave up. Still, it was a sweet and fluffy end to a sweet and fluffy start.\n",

She didn’t question it at all. Sure, she had trouble remembering people who were once close to her, like [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv6DAiZLbUk&t=823s), and others she was only vaguely familiar with, like [Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=KUz2qVX6vM0F-4ff&t=2737)—but beyond that, she was remarkably unbothered.\n\nMaybe, in some strange way, it was a blessing. A clean slate. A sweet release from the trail of crimes she’d left behind in her last adventure. Wrongfully suing a local business, corrupting the land, singlehandedly wiping out all of Fuwawa’s chickens in one fell swoop—this new journey was her chance at redemption.\n\nShe chose to be a jeweler this time. Why? Simple. Shiny things. Shiny things meant money. And Mococo loves money—we all know this. So the choice made perfect sense.\n\n[Me like shiny](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=_C3pZF1YEMxXEZ0S&t=1825)\n\nAnd so the fuzzy one’s journey began. Like everyone else, she had to learn the ropes of this new world. Of course, she made the most of her amnesia along the way—using it as a convenient excuse to mess with others for her own [amusement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv6DAiZLbUk&t=3798s). She dove straight into mining, digging up shiny gems and jewels, the sparkle of which lit up her eyes with [dollar signs](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=rNUGrnLRv6cy2cIy&t=4350). Her love for money hadn’t changed one bit, and she made that clear—yes, even if it involved a little [violence](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=X8jas4hawvrGxh2Y&t=6315).\n\nNot much else happened—it was only Day 1, after all. And honestly? That was probably for the best. After how chaotic things got for Mococo last time, she could use a bit of peace. Time to refresh her mind, perhaps become a kinder, gentler soul. Sure, she was still a little obsessed with cash, but who isn’t? At the very least, she didn’t have to worry about lottery tickets anymore. She could live her life, make her own choices, and—oh no, Mococo, no! She found the gambling machine!\n\n[Here we go again](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=xxcTjEyCBICYhYy1&t=9886)\n",

            "title": "Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame",
            "content": "Right as she was regaining her composure after a long slumber—ever since the battle against the corrupted King—Elizabeth suddenly found herself thrown into a place that somewhat resembled a library, where a cat named Fia greeted her and explained the current situation.\n\nThere was a lot to take in, but one detail stood out to Elizabeth more than anything else: she had been brought back in time, to an earlier state of Libestal. Her memories were fractured, and she was told she would need to recover them beyond the kingdom’s walls.\n\nElizabeth found this peculiar. She could still recall everything—her battles, her comrades, the life she once lived. But not everyone could say the same. When she met Mococo again, the latter didn’t even [recognize her](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=7Td3cbu0PPDJkx27&t=606).\n\nAfter some discussion about the library's mechanics with Kiara and Calli, Elizabeth eventually met with the Princess, who further clarified the current state of things.\n\nHaving had enough of the info dump, Elizabeth’s new journey began. Like everyone else, she needed to learn the ropes of this unfamiliar kingdom. A lot had changed: the guilds were no more, her Jade Sword master was nowhere to be found, and her former guildmates didn’t even remember her clearly. Her status as a knight who once protected the kingdom no longer held any meaning. Instead, she was told she had to… get a job.\n\n[Elizabeth \"Smith\" Bloodflame](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=NAyI0H-VdaVYmt1i&t=1901)\n\nFrom a noble knight to working minimum wage—what a downgrade. Still, Elizabeth was dutiful, and she took on the challenge. After some thought, she chose to become a smith, even crafting a quirky title for herself to match the role.\n\nBut of course, her journey was anything but smooth. Just moments after signing up for her job, the red knight—turned smith—ran into a very familiar face she absolutely did *not* want to see: Tam Gandr. A big meany. Though this time, something felt… different.\n\n[Hmm, she's not mean](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=cub9RWxGvm1oH9sK&t=2105)\n\nTam didn’t seem to remember who Elizabeth was, which strangely delighted the red maiden. The obnoxious, self-proclaimed queen was no more. But fate wasn’t so kind, for there was another blue maiden Elizabeth would've rather remained forgotten (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: She’s jesting, right?](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-2-left-2)).\n\nEven Elizabeth’s ex-daughter, Koseki Bijou, had no recollection of her. And with that, Elizabeth slowly realized—maybe this wasn’t a joke. Maybe she really *was* one of the few who had retained her memories. Was she sad? Was she shocked? Not really. She just felt… tired. Being thrown back in time, forced to adapt to a new life on the spot, and now the people she once held close couldn’t even remember her? Mentally, it was draining.\n\nStill, she pressed on. Maybe by focusing on her tasks, she could push those feelings aside. That plan didn’t exactly pan out either. Elizabeth was terrible with directions—[*very* terrible](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=y_o1ps5Fsgg5Gp0T&t=2561). While others zipped through their new jobs, she was constantly lost, repeatedly [struggling](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=k7qXNc2nNN22aSHQ&t=3331) to figure out where to go next, to the point she broke character and yelled out in sheer indignation.\n\n[*I miss my horse...*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=PnLljHdIk11Y8jBm&t=3454)\n\nEventually, after taking thousands of misdirected steps, she started to figure things out. Things began to look up. She chatted with [others](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=ECQ3WNgCsEOouRSU&t=4018), cracked some [terrible jokes](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=HRKqbzfBMQze3nLm&t=4666), and discovered that her sword could [shoot fire](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=rj1mAKCPPbUAYG2p&t=4782). She even managed to sneak up on Ina to prank her.\n\n[Potato Fairy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=R8Vy2HffirjAtLMt&t=6674)\n\nAs a smith, her role was to craft and upgrade weapons—both for herself and for others. But Elizabeth, wielder of a massive claymore, was more of a swinger than a maker. The whole smithing thing [confused](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=sigydwBMx8Bvvkd-&t=7247) her, and in the end, she gave up on the job—at least for now.\n\nInstead, she chose to build herself a [humble home](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=HlRR5c81lqUhhU2P&t=10915). She painted it green, a nod to her days as a Jade Sword member—something small to bring her comfort in a world where most of her friends had forgotten her. And so, her new adventure began, a lonely but determined march through the mystery that is Libestal.\n",

            "content": "Tanakisha Karia, or rather, Kiara Takahashi's memories returned though some parts remained a blur. What happened in the end? A fierce battle of epic proportions? \n\nThe mystery didn't last long as a [voice](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=471) reminds her.\n\nShe told Kiara of The Outsider who tricked everyone into freeing him. How his hate would consume millions of other worlds if not stopped. Thankfully, there is a way.\n\nKiara soon found herself in a strange Library, one caught between worlds and of time and space. A mysterious librarian brought her, and others, here. [Fia](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=753) explained who The Outsider is, how the Libestal they knew was but a Mirage, and the key to The Outsider's defeat. Unfortunately, the latter is unknown as Fia's memories are also lost. In order to save the world, Kiara must bravely venture back to Ancient Libestal and find everyone's memories.\n\nWith that in mind, Kiara and Mori Calliope (Also known as Morden Ramsay) were designated as the official Lorekeepers of The Library and relayed their mission to their fellow heroes. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, Kiara spoke of keeping a journal daily and to record the events so nothing goes amiss.\n\nWith hope in their hearts, they all set forth towards their adventures soon meeting the last Royal of Libestal, [Princess Iphania](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=1374). The Princess told a tale of how Ruination has destroyed her kingdom and family, how a Book of Prophecies foretold the end of everything in 7 days. Though the brave Princess does not know whether or not Kiara's mission would align with her own, she allows the heroes to stay in the kingdom to prepare.\n\n[For a hammer](#embed:https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=1876)\n\nDespite her overqualifications to be a chef, Kiara decided that being a smithy would benefit her in the long run. With her prowess with her sword, being a smithy will only lead to this beautiful Knight in becoming stronger.\n\nAfter slight difficulty in reading the map, the effects of time travelling lingered, Kiara eventually made her way and soon heard word of Stains roaming the kingdom and soon left to vanquish them. On the way look for the quest, Kiara found Elizabeth and is relieved to see that she too recalled their previous adventure.\n\n[Lost in only directions](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=2908) but never in heart Kiara eventually made her way to the Remnants and before she could procure the materials essential to smithy jobs, must first take care of the Stains. Hard fought, almost defeated but by the timely appearance of others, they secured a safe victory.\n\nAlong the way, Kiara met many of her companions. Though perplexed by the youths of today who would rather speak through the floors, the concept of 'dawg's - Kiara made wonderful connections, such as forming a kindred spirit with fellow orange smithy Gonathan and finding a possible cousin with Cecilia Immerkind due to the common language they speak and an appreciation for kindness.\n\nFocusing on the quests beforehand to prepare for the coming days, Kiara gained more experience as a smithy and began trading her goods with others free of charge, for her Noble Spirit as a Knight shines ever bright. Not everyone is in agreement with Kiara's ideals as Rao Pandora and her employees, the former Princess Bijou and Mococo, enforces the [Capitalistic ideals](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=9621) even possibly persuading Ina. Against all odds, and perhaps due to Kiara's kind nature, she may have convinced Bijou that fairer trades could be made - not just ones by gold.\n\nSoon, Elizabeth calls Kiara to the building area, a generous place that our heroes are free to use as they see fit, and shows her the beginnings of their shop. Kiara marvelled at the craftsmanship Elizabeth showed but is appalled that the other knight was too humble, giving herself only the sparsest of places to rest and insisted they share the upper floor.\n\nA knight and hero's work is far from over as the deadline looms over their heads. Tired, Kiara writes down on her journals before departing to rest, pondering on what the next day could bring.\n",

There, she told them of The Outsider, the one who donned on the King's skin and tricked them into freeing him from his prison.

Even if the dungeon is still not yet available, it does not mean that the day is wasted. Together with Tammy, Ina, and Gonathan with a G, the group explored The Library and found codes hidden within the texts of the books, including [Fia's](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2910) bringing suspicion their benefactor.\n\nSoon after leaving The Library, Peasant The Bae meets The Hot Pink One once again, finding that the HPOs are married. Whenever The Hot Pink One speaks, it leaves Bae annoyed though she still eventually agreed to being the SC, supply chain, for HPO's the consort's concert. Throughout the rest of day, Bae would find the Hot Pink One constantly nearby.\n\nAfter some guidance, Bae finds her way to Job Hall to accept her quest and begin her work as a Supplier. Together with fellow Supplier Cecilia Immerkind, they left for the mines to mine Lapis Lazuli, learning on the way of their abilities to improve the quality of their tools. As they gathered materials, Cecilia and Bae bonded over their previously unemployment status and the woes of being chosen as heroes. After gathering more materials, Peasant The Bae soon learns that she would need better quality tools and must purchase them from the seller.\n\nSoon after gathering enough materials, Bae learns that she would need coins to purchase better tools. In order to accomplish this, she sets out to defeat Stains that littered the kingdom and soon enough earnt [enough and more.](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=7007)\n\nGoing back to the Kingdom, Bae finished her job and trades some iron ore to Shakira and receives an upgrade stone. With money now in her pockets and tools enchanted well all seems well for our beloved Bae. But alas, misfortune would soon befall her...\n\nGacha. Gacha would soon leave Bae poor once again as she attempted, and failed (even after receiving gold from Cecilia to save wisely), to obtain any of the special prizes.

Why? Because she remembered everything. And more importantly, she had been tasked by a certain important someone—Fia—alongside Kiara, to oversee operations at the Library. That made her feel special. She was the main character now. Probably.\n\n[I'm your hero](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=d-oTxkczcDfoDeMa&t=1009)\n\nAnd with that self-appointed title came great responsibility: explaining to the others what was happening, what to do, and how to go about it. You know, main character things. She carried herself with pride… which only made the looks she got from others more awkward—especially after she loudly introduced herself as *Mordon Ramsay*.\n\nRegardless, her new journey had to begin. Having been a cook before, it was no surprise that Calli chose to become a [chef](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=vJIwAPJzVnd5H6Yo&t=1666) again. As for the world-saving stuff—how she was one of the “Falling Stars” destined to rescue the universe? Yeah, no one really cared about that. Mordon Ramsay was here to cook, and cook she shall.\n\nShe quickly befriended her new (or were they old?) comrades, including the likes of Gonathon (see [Calli-Gonathon: My Dawg](#edge:mori-calliope-gonathon-g-bottom-1-bottom-3)). She had a lot of “dawgs.” She formed bonds with [fellow chefs](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=3GeaCgPBFqQL-cAU&t=3179), started questing, and got used to the mechanics of the new kingdom.\n\nWith the basics out of the way, she turned to her true ambition: [opening a shop](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=Y4GcVRFhNDwNYn6w&t=4391)—again. But this time, it would be grander. Better. More delicious food. More divorce services. More charging married couples exorbitant fees. And this time… maybe even a few employees. Her last tavern was built with a green theme to reflect the Jade Sword colors, but since guilds were no longer a thing, she pivoted. Maybe bricks this time—for that solid, grounded, “no tax fraud here” look.\n\nThen came the masterstroke: a secret underground fight club basement. She called it *Dawg Pound*. \n\n[Eating a fist to the face](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=7bkRNUPKvlz0tZ7i&t=9404)\n\nA place for others to throw hands in the name of glory (and entertainment), while the soundtrack was none other than [“Lava Chicken”](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=xfsHwyAD0T8QPExJ&t=12501) sung by Koseki Bijou. Calli, of course, would be sitting pretty, raking in the profits as the crowd roared.\n\nIt was thrilling. She got straight to work laying the foundation—literally—for the Dawg Pound, pushing aside all that “save the world” and “recover your memories” stuff. Journals? Nah. Fight club first. Priorities. And in true Calli fashion, she was locked in.\n\nBefore, well, others planned on ruining her business\n\n[OI!!!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=_NKA4AiEGnoMhNqK&t=15668)",

Naturally, her first instinct was to drown herself.\n\n[The instrusive thoughts](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=do0y3EhgCYkvoJ2D&t=1080)\n\n...Unsurprisingly, she failed.\n\nThis was classic Shiori: defying expectations, doing everything on her own terms—even if it meant risking the safety of the world, unsettling those around her, or earning the label of \"freak.\" Choosing a job like everyone else? No thanks. Supplier? Too bland. Jeweler? Too bougie. Even if the ruler of the kingdom got on her knees and begged, Shiori would have happily remained unemployed. But alas, society always had a way of forcing her hand. Begrudgingly, she chose to be a Chef—not because of any altruistic desire to feed the people, but because it gave her the perfect excuse to [poison](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=XKamh_0_UlRKCyzN&t=1816) them. A true hero.\n\nThus began the tale of perhaps the most dangerous chef the kingdom had ever seen. One who casually referred to a random woman as [Pickle](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=5acuSuxcDzRRtjdl&t=2667), spoke freely of burying gold and breeding pigs, and generally operated in ways no one could predict. And yes—she cooked. A lot.\n\nTo everyone’s shock (and mild horror), Shiori turned out to be exceptionally good at it. She cooked up a storm and hit over 1500 coins before anyone could blink. But for Shiori, it wasn’t enough. A new idea took root—not opening her own shop (too much effort), but rather, what if she... sold her goods on *someone else’s* shop?\n\nAnd so the Oreo Maiden’s devious schemes began. The unfortunate target? Whichever poor soul owned the establishment she decided to “borrow”.\n\n[Undercutting is crazy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=Y_mj_z_Qpgx2OJKj&t=11795)\n\nIn no time at all, Shiori transformed from misunderstood oddball to infamous kingdom scammer, surpassing even the speed record previously held by FaunaMart. Her notoriety spread far and wide, reaching even the ears of reclusive figures like Tam Gandr, who typically couldn’t be bothered with trivial social noise.\n\n[There there](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=oYopwgLcQ619PkeF&t=13380)\n\nAll in all, a flawless start to her new culinary life of chaos.\n",

She downloads that information into her memory and begins to [deciper](https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?si=2UOnqwjLJsmTQRkc&t=7528) the meaning but to no avail.\n\nShe continues her exploration of the castle, stopping any person who is potentially interested in conceiving the potential threat. She then stumbles upon the princesses room and is enthralled by her scent. Cecilia then gazes out the window and makes a vow:\n\n[Saving you and the world](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?si=V7s8jRdSb-bw9IzT&t=8520)\n\nShe returns to the job hall where the adventurers are toiling with their work to accomplish their tasks when she meets Tanakisha Karia where they learn they are cousins (see [Cecilia-Kiara: Cousins](#edge:cecilia-immerkind-takanashi-kiara-left-3-top-3)) and declare a rivalry to become the most kind. After a tiring day, Immerkind sets up shop next to Jonathan and visits Mordon Ramsey and Shiori of the Novella at their restaurants for respite. \n\nAfter a long first day, Immerkind returns to the artist Pygmalion and marvels at the beauty of the completed piece.

The group had a short stint, relating over not remembering their own names, which would ironically be a great icebreaker prompt. She searched for aim between the thousands of books lining the shelves of the Library, acknowledging her presence in the distant past.\n\nShe struck up conversation with Shiori of the Nyavella, though “trying to” would be more apt descriptor considering the lively sounds of fifteen voices overlapping within the building. They shared brief banter, before the greater group came together for the debriefing from Mori Calliope and Kiara.\n\nThe nameless maiden took interest in learning the crafts of culinary arts to get by throughout the week. She was on the straight and narrow, focusing on exploring the castle grounds as she completed the Princess’ quests. She placed much trust in fellow Chef Mordon Ramsay to save Ancient Libestal, taking in her well-informed advice on the state of the land. She even agreed to become Mordon’s sous chef in her upcoming tavern, such great developments for her budding career.\n\nThe woman with crimson hair reappeared, distrusting of her apparent amnesia, to the point of accusing her to be a witch!

A cat named [Fia](#node:fia) tells her and the other heroes that they have been sent back in time to an earlier state of Libestal. The REAL Libestal, not the phony version everyone was once trapped in. While some details are clear as crystal and painful to bear, she had forgotten some details due to the effects of time travel.\n\nShe keeps her title more as a formality than a status, wishing to do good in this world to make up for what she had done before. She also remembers things about the other heroes she was once close to. While Ina remembered being her dear sister, the Hot Pink One completely forgot about Bijou and started calling her brother instead (see [Bijou-Hot Pink One: Onii-chan](#edge:hot-pink-one-koseki-bijou-top-1-bottom-3))\n\n\nPrincess Bijou quickly realizes she must take up a new lifestyle, as the role of \"Princess\" is already taken at this point in time. For some of the heroes, this doesn’t mean much more than taking up any old occupation. As a (former) princess who lived as a carefree royal for all her life, Bijou is distraught to become one with the common folk and... [GET A JOB.](https://youtu.be/pEAXwijhfFY?t=1762)\n\nBijou decides to become a Jeweler—the most natural choice for her, as a rock person. She could even take parts of herself apart if she has to. She soon finds company with others who also took up the same role. Roa, a jewel entrepreneur, is quick to bring innocent jewelers like Bijou under her wing as employees for her up and coming business. Through their partnership, they realize the potential of selling charms to the other heroes.\n\n\nOur Princess isn’t used to the commoner life. She was once spoiled by being so rich that money was of no object. The realization of having to make her own money, and thus soiling her hands with hard work… was a very foreign concept for her. Nonetheless, she forged on, determined to build her business. [\"Princesses don't earn, they receive!\"](https://youtu.be/pEAXwijhfFY?t=6275)\n\nLate into the day, Bijou would be the only jeweler left around. Several of the heroes would come to her to buy one or more charms for their own adventures, letting her rake in the cash. Between this and completing a lot of side quests, she could get used to this!\n…Perhaps avoid doing business underwater, lest you drown in the process.\n\n[Hold your breath…](#embed:https://youtu.be/pEAXwijhfFY?t=15743)\n\nThe rest of her day is spent building what will become the establishment for her charm business with Rao and the other jewelers.

It was here that Gonathon's truest virtues once again shined through, as she made sure to hear both sides of the story and worked with the two to reach an amicable agreement. \n\nWith the day drawing to a close, Gonathon retired to record her diary for inclusion in the Library.

            "content": "The Hot Pink One had forgotten—*actually* forgotten. Not from amnesia, not from time travel, not from magical interference. She just… [forgot](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=pjoUkIMvyhTJhGRu&t=375). The Outsider? The King? None of those names registered, not even a flicker of recognition when they were brought up.\n\nBut what she *didn’t* forget were the people she was about to meet.\n\nShe was briefed on the world's looming threat, how she and her fellow heroes were once again called upon to save everything from destruction. Most of it went in one ear and out the other. What *did* catch her attention, though, was when Calli mentioned that everyone was expected to keep a daily journal of their journey. Writing? The Hot Pink One? Absolutely not. She hated words with a passion. So, in true Hot Pink fashion, she tried to weasel her way out of it by claiming to be illiterate. A grown woman pretending not to read—classic.\n\n[I'm illiterate](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=Z_8Eg398E6IO1buZ&t=830)\n\nTo avoid anything that might require literacy, she chose a job that wouldn’t involve [reading or writing](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=HR2XQ6PjVgzkLghk&t=1475): Chef.\n\nAnd with that, her new journey began. Almost immediately, her infamous “Hot Pink Aura” started drawing people in. Cecilia Immerkind quickly reminded her that HPO stood for “Hard Potential Oliver” and that they were the best of friends. Bijou, after a brief conversation, remembered her too—and they instantly became sworn brothers (see [Cecilia–Hot Pink One: Huh puh](#edge:cecilia-immerkind-hot-pink-one-right-2-right-1) and [Bijou–Hot Pink One: Onii-chan](#edge:hot-pink-one-koseki-bijou-top-1-bottom-3)).\n\nShe then reunited with NinoIna and Peasant the Bae, reestablishing their previous connections—Consort and Peasant respectively (see [Hot Pink One–Ina: Consort, again](#edge:ninomae-inanis-hot-pink-one-right-2-left-2)).\n\nThen came Tam Gandr—Timmy, as the Hot Pink One decided to call her (see [Tam Gandr–Hot Pink One: Timmy and Pinky](#edge:hot-pink-one-tam-gandr-right-2-left-2)). What followed was a classic bonding session covering truly meaningful topics like siblings, not being blood-related, and... other vaguely questionable things\n\n[I don't know anymore](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=TuCyb-7ATGOS-iDP&t=3222)\n\nEventually, after a *lot* of distraction, she managed to gather enough materials to make a cooking pot and began her culinary career. With Nerissa’s help, she whipped up a few bowls of savory vegetable soup.\n\nShe also got wind of the Shiori Nyavella [scam saga](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=toRAAJgyNlb9mNMJ&t=12409) and decided to try selling her own goods—right in front of someone else’s shop. Naturally, she was promptly kicked out. Understandably so.\n\n[How dare you kick me out!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=34ktoCQAfec2Yv2Z&t=17922)\n\nIn the end, she opened her own shop—a [pink one](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=4DWyjnCRm8GAkJ9g&t=22870), of course, to match her energy. And finally, with great reluctance, she ended the day by writing her journal. A slightly chaotic, very pink beginning to what was sure to be a memorably unhinged culinary journey.\n\n[So is she illiterate still?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=UY3BYIdiRmn1_UHr&t=24060)\n",

            "title": "Nino Ina / The Hot Purple One",
            "content": "She was inexplicably trapped in a chamber of glowing ivory, and mews of *some distant Promise* enveloped her focus, if only for a moment, but that didn't stop Ina from getting her coffee water in order. Spotting some familiar figures within earshot of her, puzzle pieces of past memories immediately fell into place — NinoIna's title of Hero, and her sister, who she once freed from the influence of Ruination, all history from the lost mirage that was the realm of Libestal.\n\nA fellow fluent catto speaker helped Ina recount her previous journey of Empathy, confirming the King of the false Libestal as a masquerade of the Outsider. Beyond the Library shelves was the true Libestal back in the past, which harbored the genesis of the Outsider (no thanks to the birds and the bees — and some alleged fairy godmother), and The Librarian’s scattered memories paramount to unraveling the Outsider’s destiny.\n\nThe Library was soon full with the other fourteen \"Shining Stars\", and the two Lore Keepers among them gave a tour of the place. Ina had different plans though, she was busy perusing bookshelves and brushing with Fia.\n\n\nNino “Starlight” Ina was intercepted by Princess Iphania and her guards. They escorted her into the Kingdom’s final bastion, where the Princess declared desire to defy Libestal’s Prophecies foretelling doom in seven days. Ina entertained the Princess' wish of repelling the looming malevolence *togethaaaa*! After deliberation with some disembodied voices, Ina gravitated towards the crafting of Charms, choosing work under the mentorship of Grand Jeweler Chrys.\n\nFor a few moments, Ina [kept her head down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=2010s) and struggled to find her way out of the Job Hall. In a detour to speak to the Princess, Ina bumps into a dark-caped character [seemingly well-spoken in the Libestan tongue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=2080s). Fia’s memory fragments, which crashed onto the land as felled stars, had become strongholds of the Ruination. Ina was to seek assistance from the court’s mages as they gradually map out safe paths to travel to those Star Sites throughout the week. That was, if she could channel her navigation skills to find the castle exit.\n\nWith the magic communications relic found on her person, Ina was mysteriously compelled to establish telepathic connection with a random peasant for a jape. While gathering intel on the first \"Star Site\" to visit on the next day, she overheared the self-introduction of a humble chivalrous knight, perhaps a comrade of days past? *NinoIna* had placed a nametag conveniently atop her head for easy identification, much to the benefit of... her Queen? No, that can't be, this person [eats paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=2540s). A fine demonstration for that peasant, at least, for knowledge is superfood.\n\nSome of the books in the Library held [illegible text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=2848s); It might be Ancient Libestal script, or even a cipher for hive-minds to solve. From what was still readable, though, she learned of an unnamed Library authority whose position that cat succeeded.\n\nIn a bizarre twist of fate, Ina reunited with her eternal consort, who the peasant seemed to be [cosmically at odds with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=3150s) (see: [Ina-Hot Pink One: Consort, again](#edge:nino-ina-the-hot-purple-one-hot-pink-one-right-2-left-2)). The group crossed paths with a bubbly Tam Gandr (she's low-key about it), who Ina now called \"Tammy\".\n    \nIna was eager to shirk the status of unemployed Hero and attain grand riches, embarking on a [Clean and Simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=3917s) beeline to the Job Hall, but got lost (again) in the [dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=3976s) hallways of the castle labyrinth.\n    \nThe Grand Jeweler entrusted Ina with the initial task of procuring materials to craft a Basic Crimson Charm. On her way out the Kingdom walls, she saw the Hot Pink One and co. loitering about the Enchanted Wagon arguing joblessly.\n    \nVenturing out to the remnants of the Cliffs of Sidero, Ina began her arduous mission of getting sidetracked. A true Hero on the hunt, no Stains nor Stain-like wild cows were spared; Handmade Steak is always handy to have. Through sheer instinct, Ina sought after the experience of battle in the fields, quickly yet steadily accustoming herself to her Revelation in combat — who knew that magical projectiles from an ancient tome would be outpowered by its melee counterpart of a hundred papercuts? Despite her best efforts, Ina got overwhelmed by the terrible Flying Stains, thus she retreated to safety to recover.\n    \nAfter a brief first meeting with a fellow Jeweler (BAU BAU), Ina joined hands with a quill-wielding lady, forming a party of introverts to adventure to the caves on the side of the Cliffs. Ina took her leisure gathering raw Iron and Coal from the magically regenerating ores, before parting ways with her party member of five minutes. Armed with more confidence, she stayed on the plains hunting Stains, likely becoming the first among the Shining Stars to reach the upper limit of experience she could gain within the day.\n    \nIna was making good progress on her first Jewel-working task, when she became enamored by the beautiful sights of the mature untended fields next to the castle. As she uprooted and replanted the wheats and potatoes, [a faraway whisper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=6909s) motivated her to pour her heart and soul into honoring the potato harvests. Ina vowed to make the \"potato fairy\" proud through her dedication (see: [Elizabeth](#node:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame)).\n    \nIna ran into her eternal consort in the outskirts of the plains, and joining the HPO-Squared family unit was the Hot Pink One's now-brother Gonathon. Roa snuck some of Ina's baked potatoes, unknowingly inducting herself into Ina's new \"Potato Club\". Ina aimed to continue that approach to rope more warriors into the club (though she never managed to fully follow up on this thereafter.)\n    \nBack in the castle, Ina practiced crafting her very first Charms, learning the high-randomised quirks of the craft. While advancing through her career, she also began procurement of materials to strengthen her Revelation via Kiara and her brother-in-law. Unfortunately, she also heard through the very much *not* soundproof walls about the disbandment of her short-lived party, much to her sadness.\n\nHPO-Squared and Bijou had a lively barter negotiation of their respective services, with Ina receiving scrumptious Potato Salad from her eternal consort. Even so, she developed some jealousy over the blood-brothers' close relationship.\n    \nRoa cornered the currently-independent Jeweler Ina to inquire on her non-profiteering business practices. Later on, Ina was beckoned to join Roa and Bijou at the Lucky Lounge, conducting their first union meeting as Jewelers to discuss a joint venture, in a thinly-veiled attempt by Roa to monopolize the *gacha*-fied Charm market. With a preliminary agreement to sell Basic Charms at 150 Coins, the Jewelers settled on their future shop name \"Ga*charms*\".\n    \nRecognising the great firepower potential within her magic tome, Ina made good time on upgrading her Revelation using relatively cheap material costs, and a timely leverage of the Smiths' early labor rates of free. At this point, she was potentially the most powerful ally of Libestal in terms of battle experience and Revelation strength.\n    \nThe cautious self-proclaimed Hero toiled the rest of the day away clearing the entire Quest board gaining many a Coin, plus experience that she could no longer take in due to the technical fatigue of battle. Regardless, she was content with completing her commitments, getting a view of the [beautiful artworks in Pygmalion's gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=12937s) and spending some of her disposable income on failed attempts to get a new hat.\n\nWith a token of [Mordon Ramsey's goodwill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=13151s) in her pocket, Ina staved herself off the enticement of gambling and retreated to the Library, where she pioneered a page on her brand-new Journal documenting her path to strength. [Her entry today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=13685s) was brief, not because of her desire to turn in early, but because she probably forgot what happened today.\n    \n    \nMEOWMEOW",

And the first thing she did upon seeing said cat? She called it [fat](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=HUKTRLtdetft9DSn&t=554). A flawless introduction.\n\nTam—or was she Tam? The blue maiden couldn't recall. Her name, her past journey, even her former comrades were but faint echoes in her mind. Foggy, half-remembered fragments. But she didn’t seem to care. As ever, she remained completely deadpan, even in the midst of chaos and confusion.\n\nOthers, however, seemed to remember her. Calli was the first to call her by name—Tam Gandr—followed by Gonathon, who felt an odd sense of loyalty toward her (see [Gonathon-Tam: A Sense of Loyalty](#edge:tam-gandr-gonathon-g-right-2-bottom-1)). Elizabeth? She straight up remembered Tam, no doubt about it. Even the Hot Pink One chimed in with a nickname of her own (see [Tam-Hot Pink One: Timmy and Pinky](#edge:hot-pink-one-tam-gandr-right-2-left-2)).\n\nStrangely enough, Tam became something of a focal point. Perhaps it was the uniqueness of her name—or perhaps something else—but people seemed drawn to her. \n\n[What did you call me?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=UgoR7e-WfOs8ARgy&t=3782)\n\nAnd yet, name or no name, the Tam-ness of Tam still shone through. Her signature snark, sharp side comments, and faint air of [superiority](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=vZp0hb6TVjwCsmUK&t=3549) lingered. Once a queen, always a queen… even if no one remembered her reign.\n\n\nMoving on, when it came time to pick a job, Tam chose to be a Supplier. The idea of gathering materials appealed to her, so she wasted no time getting started. She even managed to trade some of her early findings for a snazzy [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=GRs1MgjdHWSBgNzw&t=8470).\n\nAfter that, she began building her [abode](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=FQg3zwZiabQwSxev&t=12197) and took a little detour to investigate the widely-gossiped \"scammer shop\" run by none other than Shiori Nyavella. It didn’t go well—Tam unintentionally exposed how broke she was when she couldn't afford a single thing from the shop, even with a discount.\n\n[I'll be right back](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=Vw4r0ymqmj9shtiH&t=13306)\n\nEventually, Tam settled down to write her journal entry for the Library, reflecting on the bizarre start to her journey and the strange, memorable people she had already encountered.\n\n[Tam writing her diary](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=EWtPKvo1Fk35j255&t=15167)",

Even in another world, Elizabeth believed things would stay the same—the same teasing, the same exasperation, the same feelings. \n\nOr so she hoped.\n\n[Stop jesting, witch](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=c_AF1wjc3n30qs8a&t=2154)\n\nWhen Nerissa greeted the red knight with unfamiliar eyes, Elizabeth felt a sharp tug at her heart. At first, she brushed it off, convinced the witch was simply jesting—messing with her, as usual. But as their conversation went on, the truth became clear. Nerissa really didn’t remember her. Not even her beloved potato salads. Elizabeth didn’t quite know how to respond to that… except by being herself. Even if Nerissa had forgotten her, the feelings remained. And perhaps, just perhaps, if she kept up the same attitude she always had, Nerissa would remember in time.\n\nAs if their bond had never truly been severed, the two crossed paths again and again. When Elizabeth was off building in solitude, Nerissa was there, keeping her [company](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=A837PYRSHvJus1sJ&t=8673). And when Nerissa wandered off to tend to her own matters, Elizabeth was never far behind—[watching](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=YfAOcQoIOWbai1uL&t=5607) over her, just like she always used to.\n\nMaybe not all was lost. Maybe something still lingered between them. Until that day came—until Nerissa Ravencroft remembered—Elizabeth wouldn’t change a thing.\n\n[What's my name?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=Bibgd_RaoXYFdYtI&t=4831)",

She stared the Hot Pink One down and declared, with the elegance and subtlety of a sledgehammer:\n\n\n[COOK! WOMAN!

Perhaps because this was their love language. Or maybe because she couldn’t be bothered. Either way, the two fell right back into their usual rhythm—whatever that rhythm was. Love? Servitude? Mutual delusion? No one could really tell. But it worked for them.\n\nWhat was certain was that their bond, however undefined and slightly unhinged, was real. Real enough for nicknames. Real enough for jabs. Real enough for something that looked a lot like familiarity—whether that was a blessing or a curse remained to be seen.\n\n[Hot Pinky](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=f42euvBlmDcBAsdY&t=4390)\n",

The two then adventured for a while, quickly forming a bond due to their mutual hatred of all things flying. Shiori would go on to teach Gonathon how to milk a cow before the two parted ways. \n\nThe next time Gonathon would encounter Shiori would be where the knight's values were put to the test. Shiori earnestly requested Gonathon's aid in her feud with Morden Ramsey, [claiming her rival chef was demeaning her store](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=12331). However, Gonathon would soon learn the truth, and indignant over Shiori's betrayal sought to reveal her crimes to Tam Gandr. Upon reading a [seemingly heartfelt letter](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=13233) from Shiori thanking Gonathon for purchasing her food, Gonathon retracted her accusations. \n\nAfter writing her own letter to Shiori in which she struggled with the pricky topic of the Chef Wars, Gonathon became determined to learn more about Shiori, expressing a belief that Shiori meant well. Only time will tell whether this proves true, or whether the tricky Archiver continues to prey on the naive knight.\n\n[I only need to get to know her better!](#embed:https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=15101)",

A brutal game of market survival, where any tactic, no matter how underhanded, was fair play in the war of commerce. Sabotage, unionization, market manipulation—everything was on the table. From booming startups to lonely chefs tossing out yet another unsold chocolate cake, it was cutthroat, chaotic, and kind of impressive.\n\n![Roa and Co's business: Gacharm](/images-opt/gacharm.webp)\n\nResources were abundant and waiting, as new lands opened up for exploration—offering not just fresh adventures, but also valuable materials ripe for profit.\n\nBut beyond the economic battleground, the main quest of the day loomed: the opening of the first dungeon—**Star Site: Elpis**. A place that demanded cooperation to conquer, and in return, would restore the memories of a certain woman clad in hot pink.\n\n![The heroes battling the Stain King Elpis](/images-opt/elpis.webp)\n\nAnd speaking of hot pink, that one was *everywhere* today. Whichever direction you looked, there she was, entangled in yet another wild, unhinged, and somehow meaningful interaction. The web of relationships spun around her only grew more chaotic and expansive by the hour—fitting for a day centered around memories, mishaps, and maybe just a bit of madness.",

Later, she was invited by Nerissa to join Cecilia and Elizabeth in tackling the [Star Site: Elpis Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/a940cWsshj4?si=UY5Oz5F1CLczMmM1&t=2686). It was a tough one—she fell, and fell, and fell again—but in the end, the team pulled through and successfully recovered IRyS’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/a940cWsshj4?si=65k58U-GsS7g6zhV&t=5966).\n\nAfter that, Fuwawa... went right back to work. For nearly the entire day, she was rarely seen with anyone else—not even near her counterpart, Mococo. She remained laser-focused on her dream of cooking for others, knowing that it would take real effort to get there. And it paid off. She earned a small fortune, possibly becoming one of the richest in the kingdom with over 6000 coins. With that much capital, she finally laid the foundation for her very own [shop](https://www.youtube.com/live/a940cWsshj4?si=btIhScSR8a7IJhij&t=11706)—her ultimate goal coming into view.\n\nEverything was going well. She was always doing her best... Yet there was a hint of melancholy. Despite her efforts, she wasn’t part of the shenanigans the others were caught up in. Fuwawa couldn't help but wonder—once her shop was finished, would anyone even come?\n\nStill, the fluffy one had to stay optimistic. Only by holding on to that hope could she bring smiles to others’ faces.\n\n[Journal Entry for Day 2](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/a940cWsshj4?si=FUlM9YlDNyFTYcRj&t=12627)\n",

As for Mococo—money, profits, gains—those were the [only things](https://www.youtube.com/live/xLWZay9gLBY?si=l5QVdYqULsj7TfAH&t=4993) that really mattered to her. Unlike her sister, who would do anything for others, Mococo would do anything for herself (and her boss’ store, Gacharm, of course... probably).\n\nThe contrast between the two sisters ran deeper than just ideology. While Fuwawa quietly spent the majority of her day working alone, Mococo was constantly surrounded by interaction. She called a random bystander [suspicious](https://www.youtube.com/live/xLWZay9gLBY?si=vAnIIU64NtB2I7xh&t=6183) for no reason, bartered and traded, and got help whenever something was beyond her means.\n\nSo, with so many pleasant encounters throughout the day, it made perfect sense that Mococo would journal in her diary... not about heartfelt moments or personal growth, but about how many sales she made and her ambitious plans for economic domination.\n\n[Deary diary...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xLWZay9gLBY?si=SpQDxoENvcwy2x1_&t=12407)",

With so many of her comrades having lost their memories due to the effects of time travel, even if they couldn't remember her, she at least wanted to remember them—for their sake, and for her own.\n\nIn the previous journey, fragments of past adventures would surface in Elizabeth’s mind as fleeting images, but now things were clearer. To preserve the memories of her journey, her feelings, she chose to commit them to paper.\n\n[Knight's log: 0001](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=F8vVFLc7Z6fvVmx5&t=141)\n\nJade Sword, knight of honor and chivalry—those were still the principles the red-clad knight held close. Even in a new land, under a different ruler, and surrounded by those who might have forgotten her, her sense of duty, her honor, and her role as one of the \"Shining Stars\" kept her moving forward.\n\nWith that resolve, she began her new day, signing her letter as the scarlet knight she was: Elizabeth ~~Romeo~~ Rose Bloodflame (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: The Fumbler](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-2-left-2)).\n\nShe had two goals for the day: actually do her job as a smith, and tackle the Star Site: Elpis Dungeon. The former came easily—she jumped straight into upgrading her weapon, which turned out to be much simpler than she’d anticipated. The latter, though, presented a different challenge—not in difficulty, but in deciding who to enter the dungeon with.\n\nFortunately, that question was soon answered. While helping Nerissa upgrade her weapon, the songstress invited her—along with Cecilia and Fuwawa—to take on the dungeon together.\n\nIn the meantime, Elizabeth took on some quests—because, frankly, she was broke. During this, she shared a... let’s say *interesting* exchange with Cecilia. Friendly? Maybe. Quirky? Definitely. The lady in green was far weirder than Elizabeth remembered (see [Elizabeth-Cecilia: Are You Okay?](#edge:cecilia-immerkind-elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-left-0-right-1)).\n\nLater, the team entered the [dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=RswqYsQvMw0bMKm5&t=4650). It was packed with puzzles and demanded teamwork to succeed, but after many—*many many many*—falls, they finally triumphed over the boss and recovered IRyS’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=zwOuOP18N9MN1rsA&t=7953).\n\nAfterward, Elizabeth resumed her smithing duties. And yet, despite all the effort, she somehow remained flat-out poor. So, a bit exhausted and more than a little defeated, she turned to what any righteous knight would do in their downtime: prank people.\n\n[*I will eat your eyes*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=uwFsQZoNgN5PsqYa&t=9848)\n\nToward the end of the day, she joined Kiara and Shiori to explore the Stronghold of Ruin, capturing cinematic shots of the [stunning scenery](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=P3mmCuJ4ecTixSHu&t=13604)—a peaceful close to a long and eventful day.\n",

A hero who defended the kingdom but at the cost of creating a greater evil. New areas are now available, piquing Kiara's interest. More materials to gather from and new dungeon to crawl. Another chance to grow stronger.\n\nIt was harder than expected, for as Kiara's spirit as a Knight remained steadfast, her enemies are eager to match her in strength. Bijou and Roa would recommend new charms to increase her stats.\n\nKiara would then show her experience as a business woman as she securing [great sales](https://youtu.be/R23_uw22SK0?t=7392) for her upgrade stones. She would gain more customers, and a more humble fortune, as her experience as a smithy grows, crafting better quality upgrade stones soon after.

            "content": "Bae couldn't help but gasped at the shops that now surrounded her; what was an empty lot was now the starting of small bustling town as everyone started to build their own shop. The former Princess Bijou from the The Gacharms Shop nearby greets Bae and after a pleasant conversation opens up the idea of possibly purchasing some of Bae's wares to be included in their gacha. \n\nInspired, Bae decides to set up her own - a Knickknack shop to sell items she had found whilst being poor to include a double service of sorts: with every purchase customers can get a free enhancement! With that in mind, Bae quickly used her construction box to gather mud, for it is the best suited material for a Peasant-owned shop, and Acacia leaves... Of which is vaguely familiar to The Bae. But it is not enough so, Bae sets out to gather more materials and perhaps gain more experience.\n\nA coward no more, Bae's understanding of her Revelation and her strength as a hero grows after each battle. Soon, she is astounded by the gold she now has. Perhaps, a hero's life is not a bad one. Though, soon she is overwhelmed and must retreat 'fore she dies.\n\nShe meets Nerissa, one of the chefs who opened a restaurant, and is intrigued by the food being sold. The best Potato Salad? Likewise, Bae advertised her own shop and hopefully there might be [more business](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=1125) between the two in the future.\n\nBae ponders about her business - how much lapis lazuli would she need to do a full enhancement? The answer escapes her as unfortunately, being poor left much of Bae's maths skills null but fortunately, the voices in her head helped her solve that she would need 64 lapis lazuli and even suggested a fitting name to the shop: [tHE dUMPSTER!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=1764). The Peasant The Bae's tHE dUMPSTER: Where one man's trash is another's treasure!\n\nSoon after, she meets The Hot Pink One again and began boasting of her shop that will, one day, have things to sell and with it, a free enhancement. Afterwards, Bae seeks Bijou's advice about the emeralds she collected and ultimately managed to sell a stack (plus 5 extra) for 100 gold. Ina too later would be The Bae's first official customer as Bae would upgrade [~~scam~~](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=2714) Ina's pickaxe for 100 gold.\n\nWith newfound confidence, and more materials gathered for The Dumpster, and Bae began filling the empty lot bit by bit. To commemorate the event, she would name her beloved pickaxe and axe, PP and PA respectively, and then... buy more gacha for the [materials of course!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=3602). No regrets were had, clearly.\n\nBut then, Bae remembers her goal: to recover their memories. With a steady breath, she makes amends with The Hot Pink One and joined her, the Consort, and Shiori to tackle the Elpis Dungeon where their teamwork and trust were put to the test. [Multiple times](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=6308). As Elpis Dragon falls before our heroes, The Hot Pink One remembers who she was. Soon after the quest is done, they reported back to the Princess and, then Fia, learnt that the Outlander is indeed a hero and is investigating the Stronghold of Ruins.\n\nNow that Bae has gotten stronger, so did the Stains, and at her current level - defeat is all to common. She goes on a series of quests, to improve her equipment, and at last [Bae The Peasant is now Bae The Peasant with GOLD!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=9443). But, with a price as her beloved PP axe would be mistakenly traded off. Though it was quickly replaced.\n\nAnother thing was amiss, in Bae's staying true to her Peasant nature, Bae has unknowingly slighted Cecilia Immerkind. Never fear for in the end drinks were had with celebration, the hatchet was burried and the two made up - and perhaps, an [attraction](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=10425) has started. Though the moment was ruined by the Hot Pink One and the two once again had heated words.\n\nAccomplished and now rich, The Bae would write down in her journals, the words of Mother echoing in her thoughts, and finished the day.",

Later on, Mordan would advertise her tavern but a potato path would catch Pandora's eyes spies Nerissa's shop at the end. Recalling her shop has the best potato salad, Pandora inquires about it but then found herself caught between the two chefs trying to [out-chef](https://youtu.be/i54lsw-XjDA?t=4654) the other.\n\nSatisifed with the food, Pandora was compelled to give free samples, to both Mordan and Nerissa.

It wasn’t just a place to grab a bite; it offered a range of wildly concerning services as well. Thus was the proud creation of Mordon Ramsay.\n\n[Tour of the tavern](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=s2oebW-2OPVZa5Jt&t=997)\n\nThe place was pink. Pink on all four sides, pink from top to bottom. The roof sparkled with sea lanterns, and the inside was—well, still pink, but a warm, welcoming kind of pink. The main dining area was lined with tables, with sakura petals gently falling from above, a single portrait of the owner herself hung for all to see. Beneath it lay the basement, home to a secret fight club, and above were guest suites of varying classes: Peasant, Knight, and Libestalian King—each with a balcony view of the kingdom’s vast green fields. At this point, it was looking more like a motel than a tavern.\n\nIt was beautiful—but not finished. Miss Mordon had more ideas. She later established a [Therapy Stall](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=cLBaeNYSgM9NfhrZ&t=4070) right next to the tavern: 100 coins for solo sessions, 200 for couples. A chef who could cook, run a motel, and now offer therapy? What *couldn’t* she do at this point?\n\nShe had to do it all, though—the economy was tough, and it was a battlefield for folks like her. Of course, collaboration helped, like the one she had going with [Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=-Az4QRmpYlH1g237&t=2062).\n\nTurning back to the main quest, Mordon teamed up with Kiara, Biboo, Roa, and Mococo for a mission to the [Star Site: Elpis Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=Mcd8vEwgowdvbG3w&t=6353), where they successfully recovered memories of [IRyS](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=8aHIbG2KX1DFLf3y&t=8501).\n\nToward the end of the day, she went out to gather more ingredients for cooking. Unfortunately, she ran into a slew of monsters, so she hired a bodyguard—who promptly failed at being a bodyguard. Mordon returned home, only to once again be assaulted by the one person who seemed to be bugging her business just for the fun of it (see [Mordon-Shiori: Please Leave Me Alone](#edge:shiori-nyavella-mori-calliope-bottom-2-top-2)).\n",

So why would something so cruel happen to her poor little chickens?\n\nStill, what’s gone is gone, and Shiori had other things to focus on. After all, she was running a business—ShiorinEats—delivering food to those in need at (not) very reasonable prices. It didn’t take long for her to make her first sales of the day to Peasant da Bae with a couple of loaves of [bread](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=77RXYlj7fMgVBGrw&t=1075), before joining her, along with Ina and the Hot Pink One, to take on the [Star Site: Elpis Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=ms6YkOl_w5irfv65&t=1195)—the first of many.

But by now, her name had spread far and wide, and even if she was doing anything remotely normal, those around her remained [wary](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=jwnA-XIXNucAjI44&t=4991). Especially one she had previously tormented—mentally.\n\n[I'm just hanging out](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=LPtF6PiDQRb6_vti&t=6559)\n\nBut really, why would anyone be suspicious? She was just a humble delivery girl who maybe tried scamming a poor, broke knight with supposedly discounted [pork chops](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=SU4dNnWgXpyefwAL&t=7050).

Totally normal behavior.\n\nAnyway, toward the end of the day, Shiori journaled her journey on Day 2—a day where she learned about the quirks of others and witnessed various curious events unfold.\n\n[Journal for Day 2](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=jWYO3t1b6Ki-kv-z&t=12609)\n\nShe also gave Gonathon beets, again, for completely [non-suspicious reasons](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=OFSnHhwRpTtRCLr_&t=13186).\n",

She’d devised a system to randomize which charm would be dispensed—using letters to pick a random spot on the display board inside the store.\n\nBijou was among the first to wake up today, ahead of the dungeon’s grand opening. She spent most of that time gathering crafting materials, constructing the shop’s storage area, and knocking out side quests. All for good reason—she wouldn’t be able to stay around for long.\n\nHer hard work didn’t go unnoticed. Her boss, Roa, gave her something to take on her adventures in return: a little Beast Stain hat! [“A friend?! Wait… a friend?”](https://youtu.be/03m4uWAFfQg?t=4938) Somehow, this seemed oddly familiar to Bijou. Thinking about it made her head ache… but hey, it was friend-shaped. Roa said its name was Bob.\n\nHaving given a few folks a tour of her new shop, Bijou teamed up with Roa, Mococo, Kiara, and Gordon to take on the dungeon of the day—[Star Site: Elpis](https://www.youtube.com/live/03m4uWAFfQg?si=v8NPjzKF80d-iANM&t=7792).

Some brother.\n\nLater, Bijou went back to stocking the shop with new items, working hard so she could ~~scam~~ make her boss proud—grinding, bartering, doing all the things a good employee would.\n\nAs the day came to a close, she joined her brother's group by the riverside to drink, both to cool down and to celebrate the upcoming occasion. Was Bijou of age? Who knows. But she had fun, and that’s what mattered.\n\n[Cheers, and Happy Birthday!](#embed:https://youtu.be/03m4uWAFfQg?t=14062)\n\nShortly after that gathering, Bijou got so drunk she nearly drowned in the river.

It was, understandably, frustrating. Especially when her little brother was already employed by what looked like the kingdom’s biggest business chain, raking in coin by selling much-coveted goods through gacha.\n\n[Questionable business practice](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=b8NxQYC2U1P93sbS&t=784)\n\nShe tried confronting the store owner for \"corrupting\" her brother—not out of jealousy, of course—but the moment she realized the store sold items she needed, she folded on the spot (see [Hot Pink One–Roa: Pink Union](#edge:hot-pink-one-roa-pandora-left-1-top-3)).\n\nGiven how rough her situation was, she decided to potentially team up with another broke chef struggling to make sales (see [Hot Pink One–Nerissa: Chef Union](#edge:hot-pink-one-nerissa-ravencroft-bottom-2-top-2)).\n\nBack on track—today was a big day for the pink lady. A dungeon had opened, and this one *called* to her. Not because of its funny name, [Star Site: Elpis](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=kiT67P23j1CsC3Zx&t=3512), but because of the secrets it promised to unveil.\n\nShe joined forces with Shiori, Ina, and Da Bae. The dungeon, floating far above the world, was themed around Angels and Devils. It challenged them with puzzles that required cooperation at opposite ends. Many... *descents* happened, testing the patience of our heroes—mostly due to the pink one’s inability to tell left from right. After navigating three puzzles, they faced the two-headed dragon: Stain King Elpis. But with the combined strength of the four, they emerged victorious.\n\nAnd then, the pink one finally remembered who she was.\n\n[One that brings Hope](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=0Hi16X4sdeWI_MnW&t=6194)\n\nShe wasn’t just a struggling chef trying to sell chocolate cakes—she was IRyS, the Nephilim born of war between Angels and Demons. With her voice, she united both factions, a being people called “a goddess”—albeit an alcoholic one.\n\nThough the revelation was profound, she didn’t change all that much. Maybe she had always been this way.\n\nTo celebrate the occasion, she joined Immerkind and the others for a drinking party by the creek, where IRyS’s commentary made many question her divine status (see [Immerkind–IRyS: Classists](#edge:cecilia-immerkind-hot-pink-one-right-2-right-1)).\n\nBrimming with empathy and goodwill, the pink one later lent a hand to her somewhat close friend Tammy, helping her through the same dungeon (see [Tam–IRyS: Sapphire and Lappie](#edge:hot-pink-one-tam-gandr-right-2-left-2)).\n",

She formed a team to investigate the first crash site alongside two other Shining Stars: the Hero's eternal consort and the gear-Enchanting Peasant.\n\nStar Site: Elpis was designed to deter explorers like them. NinoIna and her betrothed, though forced apart, stood atop contrasting arenas, guiding each other through the mystical mazes of the stronghold. The Hero did what she knew best to aid her allies, using her trained strength to protect them from the Stain King's malice.\n\n[\"My queen, my goddess!\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/NSOuyMjCxPI?t=7102s)\n\nLearning of her consort's drinking patterns did not waver NinoIna's affection for her, nor the patronage of her baked goods. Wait, did they sign a prenup back in the previous world?\n\nThe victory over Stain King Elpis granted NinoIna's party a renewed fighting spirit, and the limits of their potential expanded. With greater expectations though come greater risk; thus, an excursion to procure a new gem led to [the Hero's first defeat](https://youtu.be/NSOuyMjCxPI?t=7920s) in Ancient Libestan history.\n\n[\"Mother always liked you better...\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/NSOuyMjCxPI?t=8451s)\n\nHaving overcome many trials, NinoIna painstakingly crafted a special wedding charm for her consort, in the image of the Hero's [big red heart](https://youtu.be/NSOuyMjCxPI?t=9590s). Cecilia Immerkind yearned for the closeness they shared with each other, so of course, HPO-Squared offered her a trial period as their \"Above SC\" (Super cute?

The situation was so dire, so awkward, that Nerissa had to resort to the psychic route and communicate *directly into her mind*. That’s not romantic. That’s *tragic*.\n\n[I have a mouth and I must scream](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=OdzATm030ekRJ4KZ&t=627)\n\nThen, to make matters worse, Nerissa opened up—shared her struggles trying to sell her homemade potato salad, clearly putting her heart on the line with this business pitch. She even offered Elizabeth a discount, a sweet gesture from a struggling chef to her friend. And Elizabeth? She couldn’t afford a single thing. Not even at a discount. [*Broke.*](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=IGTI21nWiEMonaNo&t=1476)\n\nAnd just when the blue one *finally* started to piece things together—recognizing Elizabeth from the fragments of their past—the red knight, in all her awkward glory, said... almost nothing. Just a few \"What do you remember?,\" and off to somewhere else she went. Girl, you were *devastated* when you realized the bird lady had forgotten you, and now that she remembers?

Five girls—Bae, Bijou, Roa, Cecilia, and IRyS—each hailing from vastly different corners of society, sat around tipsy and chattering about vital topics such as classism and narcolepsy. You know, typical girl talk.\n\n[Differences in classes](#embed:ttps://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=f-5Cd4a3zXmdMpX9&t=9651)\n\nAs time passed and the bottles emptied, the group began to disperse, until only Roa and the two besties remained—completely and utterly drunk.\n\nAt this point, Roa, with the full confidence of someone ten drinks deep, decided to walk on water. Like Jesus Christ, if Jesus were a furry.\n\nAnd, as with the Son of Man himself, the world just wasn’t ready. The two besties—green and pink—banished her on the spot. Immerkind claimed Roa was far too dangerous to remain. As for IRyS? Her reasoning was… well, *questionable* at best.\n\n[That's a yikes for me, boss](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=fyqwpYA7HUIavSRU&t=10084)\n",

He revealed more about his role in this tangled tale and the looming catastrophe tied to the fate of the world.\n\n![Meeting The Outlander in the Stronghold of Ruin](/images-opt/outlander-meet.webp)\n\nThat was how the day *should’ve* gone. But now, let’s talk about the absolute fever dream that was Day 3.\n\nIf you've been paying attention, you’d notice that relationships among the heroes have always been... layered. From lovers to sworn brothers, strangers to long-lost cousins, familial themes have been running strong through the kingdom—and on the surface, that sounds wholesome. Heartwarming, even.\n\nBut no. Apparently, the idea of “family” got a little *too* medieval for our band of “heroes.” Somewhere along the way, what began as playful speculation took a hard swerve into *full-on incest*. That's right—*sweet home Alabama* levels of chaos.\n\nWe had people assuming the kingdom’s ruler and her companions were both siblings *and* lovers. We had a cousin—yep, a cousin—making moves on a relative, and upon getting rejected, nearly spiraled into an emotional breakdown. And from the ashes of all this confusion came the crackpot theory to top all crackpot theories: *everyone* in the kingdom was somehow related. All of them. An entire world of inbred individuals. And from this madness was born a cult. A cult of carbs. The In-Breads. Yes, a religion that believed people were bread—sandwiches even—born of divine inbreeding.\n\n![The In-breads claiming their next victim](/images-opt/inbreads.webp)\n\nSure, there were also love stories. Drama... Wolf pack? Maybe even a couple of healthy, emotionally stable conversations. But none of that mattered. It all got absolutely steamrolled by the unhinged shenanigans of the day. Up, down, left, right—wherever you looked, it was chaos.\n\nAnd the spark that might’ve lit this family-fueled dumpster fire? One orange, fiery bird lady. Who needs logic, morals, or restraint... when you’ve got *family*, right?\n",

Nothing grand or intense—just what she’d call a \"guerilla\" adventure, aimed mostly at catching up on quests and general progress.\n\nRight at the start, she received a call from Shakira, who generously offered her assistance with anything she needed—being ahead of the game and all. The red knight appreciated the gesture (see [Kiara-Elizabeth: Sugar Phoenix](#edge:takanashi-kiara-elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-right-2-left-2)).\n\nOne of her main goals today was to finally get a portrait done—she was the only one without one, and frankly, it was about time. After some back-and-forth to gather materials (missing her horse dearly in the process), she finally got her painting. And it was beautiful.\n\n[Look at that hot lady](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=xnTcW4oA0I5l5zax&t=4441)\n\nShe then moved on to gathering materials, completing sidequests, and finally pulling herself out of single-digit coin status. Along the way, she crossed paths with others, even engaging in friendly duels—one of which was with the witch herself (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Strawberry Red](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-2-left-2)).\n\nWith her tasks wrapped up (and [pranks](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=AEpkx-sq8MxwFXQM&t=8458) delivered), the red knight headed to bed. A wise move, really—she ended up avoiding... whatever chaos went down afterwards.\n",

Rumours of her beloved cousin's (not blood-related) marriage to the Princess Iphania to charging ahead of her fellow smithies, accidentally creating a monopoly of her own, and Mococo's lacklustre sales as Jeweller troubled the Knight turned smithy's heart. This shouldn't be, Kiara resolved to support their business and buy more charms from them - and perhaps feed two chicken with one seed - and gift those to Elizabeth.\n\nSteadying herself, Kiara called Cecilia to inquire about her relations but Cecilia did not answer. That did not stop our Knight as she heads out to look for Cecilia. Upon meeting her, Kiara would admit to her heart being ['cracked'](https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=2990) when she heard the rumours. Unable to deny her feelings for the Princess, Cecilia would offer part of her heart to Kiara's refusal, only asking Cecilia to inform her since they are family\n\n[Sweet Home of Mother Matron](#embed:https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=5069)\n\nShe would meet Liz and would gift her the charms she had bought earlier, receiving a warm thanks from the lovely red knight. Soon, Kiara would end up spoiling Elizabeth, giving her construction boxes they would both need for their shop, and a pickaxe. Kiara's noble heart could not help but be endeared by Elizabeth and tells her if there is anything Elizabeth would need - be it coins, equipment, or help - Kiara will be there to support her. The two of them would bond, Kiara listening to Elizabeth missing her trusty steed and suggesting 'chicken jockey' as an alternative. They would talk about their memories, how they both remembered the past when others do not. Kiara would add that Blesseth be the ignorant for knowledge is sometimes painful. \n\nKiara sees the struggles of Gonathan's hardship in the 1st dungeon and would send words of encouragement, hoping to bolster's her fellow orange knight's confidence.\n\n[Shakira's Smithery's Here to Serve!](#embed:https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=10295)\n\nBusiness is blooming before and after the opening of Shakira's Smithery, selling more of her high quality upgrade stones to Nerissa, her first official customer, and Mordan, even refunding the latter when Mordan overestimated the stones she needed. As 'dawgs', Kiara would fondly gave Mordan a discount and receive delicious delicacies in turn. \n\nThe Dawgs, now a pack of wolves with Gonathan, Mordan, and Cecilia, would take on the dungeon together. And carefully they must look it over as Gonathan heard of clues that a treasure is also hidden in the Stronghold of Ruination. They find the fabled Outlander, seeing him trapped in the Stronghold and they will need to conquer it to free him. The puzzles were tricky but our heroes were smarter and soon the Stain King Proto was defeated, the treasured CD procured, and the hero freed. To commemorate this momentous moment, the Pack would take a photo together. Kiara would share another [tender moment](https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=14003) in Mordan's tavern as they listened to the CD.\n\nT'was an enjoyable moment but a Knight's job is never finished as Kiara would report to Princess Iphania and once again met the Outlander by the princess' side. Kiara learns more information about the Ruination and of the distrust the Outlander for them. She would then head to the library to speak of the success of the quest to Fia and meet Gonathan. Unknowingly, their conversation would soon spark a great misunderstanding that would Libestal, and *all of our heroes* their very core.\n\n[Hearts Woes, The Good Knight's Lies](#embed:https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=14392)\n\nGonathan would tell Kiara of his concern towards Cecilia, for he suspects the Princess and the Outlander are in-love. The way they spoke seemed too tender to be platonic. Gonathan feels great guilt for he encouraged Cecilia. Her heart breaking, Kiara would suggest that perhaps the best way is to present another option for Cecilia: Kiara and Cecilia are far, far, far cousins (not-blood related). Kiara convinced Gonathan to wing-man for her and Kiara in turned promised a blind date for Gonathan and that she would watch over them to ensure a successful date.\n\nIn Kiara's journal, she would write of the satisfactions of the day. The forge is done and Kiara and Elizabeth's blossomed, and there is still hope that perhaps she and Cecilia may be one day be more than simply 'cousins'.",

She has precured many materials from building blocks to diamonds and her beloved tHE dUMPSTER too is nearing it's completion - things are looking brighter.\n\nFortune has also smiled on Bae for upon meeting the Good Knight, Gonathan with a G, he has bestowed upon her a [hat](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=658). In gratitude, Bae gifts Gonathan with an enchanted pickaxe, which he named after Peasant The Bae herself, and procured a loyal customer in him. Not to be outdone, Gonathan would gift Bae greater upgrade stones. \n\nSoon, Bae would meet Elizabeth and was astounded! Beautiful and strong, though not of royalty, she exudes an aura of a Queen, just like in Bae's Mother stories. They would exchange numbers and after conversing, Elizabeth offered a spar in order to build up Bae's courage and strength. Bae would win against, Elizabeth, impressed would offer future lessons and a title of \"Pheasant\" and that perhaps, one day Peasant The Bae may become a squire - Elizabeth's. Honoured by the offer, Bae rejected it as Peasant is more than just monetary status, it is a Title from her dear Mother. [Bae was born one and will be one for eternity](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=1510). \n\nThe day goes on but as seen before, a day without arguing with the Hot Pink One is a day incomplete; as Bae would blatantly buy another chef's food in front of IRyS, whilst criticizing her cooking skills. They would trade barbs to the amusement of those around them, Bijou even suggesting that two may be fonder of each other in actuality.\n\nThe group, along with Shiori, would dive into the dungeon meeting the famed Outlander. There they learn more of the ruination and sought to free the hero. This dungeon proved to be trickier than the last for it had included [**Math**](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=3408) but it proved no match for Bae's Peasant Intellect. The battles fought were arduous but boosted by the spar early on Bae endured. Eventually, they would fight and win against Stain King Proto, receiving parts of Fia's *meowmery* and treasured disc.\n\nOutlander was then freed from the ruins and tells that this ruin is merely connected - there is another one out there. Despite being distrustful of those who just saved him, he warns them: corruption still held the kingdom in its grasp. Fia would later suggest that perhaps, it should be Bae and her companions to truly save the world and not the Outlander.\n\nThey report back to the Princess, Bae noticed a strange... sense of giddiness from the Princess Iphania upon hearing of the Outlander's rescue. Methinks they are together, thought the Peasant. That perhaps, The Outsider is the result of a [union between the two](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=4400). \n\nBae would continue questing, seeking to take hold of the disc from the first dungeon, she would head there once again along with her group. Disc obtained, they disbanded and Bae set off to mine more diamonds. \n\nAs mined, Bae noticed the concerning amount of death text from Immerkind and called her. Hearing her distraught, Bae grew worried and perplexed asked to meet. While her Immerkind waits for her, Bae suggested for her to kill any of the livestock in order to relieve some of the stress. Upon meeting her, Cecilia mentioned a special bond with the princess which shocked Bae but after reassurance that it was different special bond from theirs relaxed. But then, dropped the bombshell:\n\n[They're... Siblings?](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=6936)\n\nIn shock at the revelation of such a relation, Bae would call Gonathan with a G to confirm what Cecilia said and could only stagger that the Good Knight repeated the answer. There was no reason for Gonathan to lie to her, so Bae did not doubt the knight, rather, the pieces were falling together too well. Every Libestian they met has a similar face, like the Princess and the Outlander...\n\n[The Entire Libestal Kingdom is Inbred](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=7940)\n\nIt is a different land to their own and a different norm. Bae would know more but unfortunately (or not) her Mother skipped this part of her education before she vanished. She has no siblings so she cannot understand. Soon, she and Cecilia would relay this information to Tammy who too would [heavily question](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=7979) Gonathan. Betrothed siblings. A truly earth-shattering knowledge is now in Bae's hands. Naturally, the news must spread and so Bae would inform those around her, citing the Gonathan as the source.\n\nEventually this would lead to Bae, Roa, Bijou, and IRyS to come to another conclusion: Their faces too are alike. Ridiculous, it was at first but as they thought more, denial escaped them. Bae would leave and then rejoin the group to see that a cult had formed: In-Bread.\n\n[To-mah-toh](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=9314)\n\nA cult had formed and Bae had joined them as their Tomato and would later attempt to indoctrinate others into their group. Their goal is to become a giant sandwich. Glory to Sandwich.\n\nShortly after the brief, but lingering, insanity, Peasant The Bae returned to her would-be shop and after hours of work the fruits of her labour blossomed:\n\n[tHE dUMPSTER iS oPEN fOR bUSINESS!](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=14134)\n\nWith the day's almost at the end, Bae would continue to do a few more quests to earn some coin and bought a few more charms, Glory to Sandwich, to arm herself for future adventures. She would find a magnificent painting that truly honours the noble spirit of [Peasant The Bae](https://x.com/Mikururun/status/1899107067182411936) placing it as a finishing touch for her shop.\n\nBut wait, one last thing. With more money to spare, surely it wouldn't hurt to purchase a from one of the vendors. With a promise to earn the gold lost on the morrow, Bae bought the hat and would excitedly share it with Bijou. Bijou, upon seeing what now donned Bae's head, felt a shiver of unease.  She cautioned Bae to be careful and kept well. Bae unawares of the warning, took little head as she wrote down her day in her journal...\n\n[Glory to Sandwich](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=15371)",

Seeing that their inventory needs restocking, Roa took it upon herself to craft more charms, completing some more quests in the meanwhile to earn a bit more gold. The business between Peasant The Bae are also quite good as the supplier brought back some Stain materials that Roa needed.

Not surprised by the news she already knew, and unphased by the newer revelation, Roa would point out a key feature to support this: the Libestians all have the same face. Following Roa's keen observation, Bijou would add that *they*, the heroes of Libestal from another world, too have similar faces to each other albeit differing in colours.\n\n[We Are In-Bread.

Perhaps the trials of the day wore down on the business woman, perhaps something mysterious has (sandwich)spread over these bread-like blocky lands. Whatever the cause, a cult was born and their goal has never been clearer: To follow the bread and turn the entire world into one large sandwich. To accomplish this, they must bring other heroic ingredients into their fold and accept the in-breadness inside them.\n\nShifting her focus back on what truly matters: Gold, Roa knew [advertisement](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=7655) was key to ensure that The Gacharms stayed relevant in the minds of her customers which soon proved very effective as Bae would wonder by mentioning she received the AD though had skippa skippa it. Of course, it was only natural to of course send another one to Bae and to others.\n\nAs her day drew to a close, Roa would spruce up the shop's exterior creating a much more chic design to reflect the growth of her business.\nA third day done well despite the rocky start.

Taking a page from her brother, however, she decided to sneak a listen of a conversation IRyS had with Tam Gandr, causing Bijou to become the very thing IRyS warned about… but worse.\n\n[Vulgar language](https://youtu.be/A97SrozF36w?t=20390)\n\nThe rest of the day was calmer by comparison as others left for the day.

However, what initially looked to be a simple day of adventuring soon became anything but. \n\nMuch of Gonathon's day would be intertwined with Cecilia Immerkind (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: Wolves Before Harlots](#edge:cecilia-immerkind-gonathon-g-left-2-right-2)). Immerkind revealed her greatest desire: to win the love of the Princess of Libestal. Eager to assist her dawg, Gonathon agreed to help her. Moved by Gonathon's kindness, Immerkind declared that they had become more than dawgs, they were now wolves, and this led to the creation of the Wolf Pack, with Mordan Ramsey, Kiara, and Tam Gandr eventually joining as well.\n\n[You are truly kind.](#embed:https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=2020)\n\nSetting aside Immerkind's plot for the time being, the two wolves joined Princess Bijou and Nerissa in tackling [Star Site: Elpis](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=4404). After a long and hard fought adventure, Gonathon was able to recover a part of her memories, with a group of mysterious blonde angels reminding her of something precious. \n\n[Those angels that I saw...with their short, blond hair](#embed:https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=7532)\n\nUpon their triumphant return and after upgrading her smithing rank and acquiring new quests, Gonathon once again found herself in the company of Immerkind. It was here that Immerkind once again gave Gonathon some important words of wisdom: [to not let the past define who she was in the present](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=9664). Gonathon in turn expressed her desire to fight for the pack, and the two once again cemented their ironclad bond to each other. \n\n[The pack is the only truth!](#embed:https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=9538)\n\nWhile a [second dungeon conquest](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=12253) served as another boost of morale, what followed proved to be the spark that would sow chaos in the kingdom. Urged by Kiara to set her up with Cecilia (see [Gonathon-Kiara: A One-Sided Rivalry, A Two-Sided Pact](#edge:gonathon-g-takanashi-kiara-left-2-bottom-2)), the naive knight convinced Immerkind that the Outlander and Princess were in fact siblings. Whether this was a fib or what she truly believed, this rumor spiraled out of control, leading to the formation of an entire cult that Gonathon remained largely oblivious to. \n\nThe end of the day saw one of the most unexpected twists, with Gonathon falling madly in love with Shiori of the Nyavellas (see [Gonathon-Shiori: The Diamond and the Black Pearl](#edge:gonathon-g-shiori-nyavella-top-2-bottom-1)). While Shiori's true intentions were still uncertain, this affair served as a temporary reprieve for the troubled knight, and as she wrote her daily journal she mused on the future and her happiness. But could this joy truly last? And what of the fragments of memories that continue to close in all around her?

But the spirit was still there. Groggy or not, the pink menace set off to knock out her daily quests.\n\nThat morning daze didn’t last long, though. A phone call from her brother snapped her back into reality: someone shady had been snooping around her shop.

(see [Peasant Da Bae](#node:peasant-da-bae)). Such revelation would cause sane person to suddenly want to, uh, *\"sandwich\"* their little brother, with their big buns.\n\n[I don't know anymore](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=qANkilpIyeBOmiVE&t=9458)\n\nA chaotic day woven in many's sotries, and as the day wound down, with chaos trailing behind her, IRyS wrapped up her night journaling her wild day with her brother, one bread at a time.\n\n[Journaling the bread](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=yEZ_o8DjW8P6YgUw&t=11508)\n",

Though no longer bound, he remained cautious, skeptical of their purpose. He challenged the prophecy they carried, claiming their so-called mission to \"save the world\" would instead usher in something far worse—a Greater Evil.\n\nHe offered no further explanation.

The moment she crossed paths with the blue maiden again, encouraging chants echoed through her mind: “Don’t fumble, Milord,” “You got this, Milord.” And she was determined to prove that she did, in fact, got this.\n\nHer strategy was simple: flatter her. Call her beautiful—no, *gorgeous*—praise the majestic feathers by her hips, and even show off a bit of her smithing expertise by crafting an upgrade stone just for her. All while staying calm, cool, and collected.\n\nAnd it was working… until Nerissa gave her a [rose](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=NRlhYHYNbLkCksuF&t=7618) in return.\n\nThat’s when the cracks began to show.\n\n[Uhh, umm...uhhh](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=1dSFxlg0GsDPjdU7&t=7799)\n\n\nFirst came the fluster. Then the fidgeting. Heat crawled up her face. In a desperate attempt to wrestle back control of the situation, she called Nerissa a witch—clearly hoping the accusation would distract from the butterflies wreaking havoc in her chest. But it only made things worse. “How so?” Nerissa asked. And thus began Elizabeth’s spiral.\n\n*“Aha! Witch! I have all the reasons to call you a witch!”*—was likely the train of thought. She tried to recall their past adventures, stacking up “proof” of Nerissa’s sorcery. But each memory only made her more flustered. She claimed the blue maiden cast spells on her. *“What spell?”* Nerissa inquired. “You made my face a strawberry.” *“But how?”* “You hushed my gums.” *“What does that mean?”*\n\nIt meant Elizabeth was scrambling, that’s what.\n\nDesperate to recover, they settled on a sparring match, as if a couple swings of a wooden sword could knock the embarrassment out of her.\n\nElizabeth didn’t need to hold back—she was already nerfed. Swinging her blades, raising her shield, trying to stay focused… all while a majestic blue maiden danced around in front of her, fully immersed in their little spar. Every move Nerissa made was deliberate, serious, graceful. And that sight alone? More than enough to break the composure of the scarlet swordwoman.\n\nIn the end, Elizabeth still won—she *was* a knight, after all. And surprisingly, the match helped clear her head. The fog lifted. She was calm again.\n\nFor about a minute.\n\nNerissa smiled, leaned in, and kissed her cheek. A soft, simple *mwah*. \n\nA \"reward\" for the performance. \n\nThe strawberry glowed so red it might as well have been a beacon.\n\n[Ahhh, umm...

A shared secret born from late-night giggles and stolen glances, a nickname she’d racked her brain to invent, a symbol of their unique bond. That name was sacred. And now? Thrown around like a party favor for everyone to use, as if to spit on the private promise they'd once made.\n\n[Caught in 4K](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=bs7UtPAPS8H3DCok&t=6879)\n\nAnd then—*then*—as if to turn the tables, Pinkie put her lips on another woman, mouth to mouth. *Sensually*. Right in front of Tam. Tam couldn’t bear the confrontation and left, vanishing like a ghost with a broken heart.\n\nThey found her later—alone, still, and staring out as if the whole world had turned against her. Contemplating if it was all worth it. Thankfully, Gonathon and Nerissa were there. They talked her down, gently, firmly. Told her maybe what she saw wasn’t betrayal at all. Just a “European greeting.” Normal. Harmless. Maybe... maybe there was still hope. Maybe Pinkie hadn’t meant to hurt her.\n\n[Don't krill urself](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vMdhvi8dHN4?si=XsdfZhGLe8i6dzqu&t=12841)\n\nPinkie, meanwhile, was stewing. She wasn’t convinced. What if *Tam* had abandoned their promise first? She had to know for sure. So she devised a plan: down an invisibility potion and spy on the blue maiden herself. See what truths could be uncovered. But alas—whether it was the trail of sparkles or her uncanny aura—each attempt failed. Not [once](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=vhQvTDISnORcV2gU&t=8783). Not [twice](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=Bgk3gewMRka2Fkjd&t=9184). *Three* times. Spotted immediately.\n\n[OoOohO, i'M a cUrsEd CapE](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=YKURb9sU12XWEpk8&t=10094)\n\nIn the end, there was no other choice—they had to face each other. Woman to woman. Eye to eye. Heart to heart.\n\n[Who's at fault here?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=KVdHwVsIkdh4scj1&t=10686)\n\nWords flew like daggers. Accusations, deflections, painful memories. “You broke our promise,” one said. “It was a three-way *feeding* session,” the other defended. There were tales of kissing cats. Yes—*cats*. The word “hobby” was thrown like a curse. “You were a good hobby,” said Pinkie. Tammy scoffed, wounded, bringing up *Immerkind* just to provoke some jealousy.\n\nIt was messy. Ugly. And then—*a floating cape appeared behind them*, spewing the foulest of language. A ghost? A cursed soul? Whatever it was, it scared them both witless.\n\nThey ran. Together.\n\n[Oh my god it's cursing!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=eW5yXznvFcwXnHOy&t=11037)\n\nAnd somehow, through the shared panic, they found something they’d lost—*understanding*. Maybe it was ridiculous. Maybe it was fate. But when they stopped running, so did the anger. They looked at each other, tears welled, and suddenly it all made sense again.\n\nThey forgave. They embraced. And just like that, Pinkie and Tam were whole again.\n",

She even gave herself the title of Elizabeth’s “sugar mommy”—though in this case, it was as sweet and wholesome as it sounded. The red maiden, ever innocent and a little clueless, reacted to the nickname with the wide-eyed surprise of a child.\n\n[A mom made of sugar?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=1Yg1k-_xZLiaVf6z&t=2666)\n\nWith all her tasks finished, Elizabeth asked her “mother” for one last bit of help before calling it a day. Seeing all the other heroes setting up shops to sell their goods, she wanted to try too—but had no idea where to start. She’d begun building a modest store, but a guiding hand would mean the world. Shakira, without a second thought, agreed.\n\nAnd with her deft craftsmanship, Shakira not only helped Elizabeth set up shop—she transformed it. The store came to life in a way that left Elizabeth speechless, eyes gleaming with admiration.\n\n[The Jade Forge](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=FDao9shHchm_vRuR&t=9534)",

Maybe a different path would lead to a different outcome. But the Outlander, wary and weathered, remained skeptical. If the heroes truly wished to rewrite destiny, they'd need to prove it—not with words, but with action.\n\nAnd so, the Princess gave them their next task: to investigate the next Star Site. Perhaps, within it, lay the answers they were all searching for.\n\n[What comes next](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/uX0rZYSrb4Q?si=UABlcxchRxHiGh_d&t=7144)",

At this point, that’s just tradition. Day Four delivered two things: a time lord, and a Korean soap opera. Two wildly different beasts—yet somehow, both showed up to the same dinner party.\n\nEarly in the day, our heroes zeroed in on the main objective: investigating the second major dungeon, the **Star Site: Chronos**. Here, time reigned supreme—each challenge shackled by ticking timers, counting down as the adventurers scrambled for answers. The theme wasn’t just surface-level either. This dungeon was deeply tied to the memories of a key figure. One that many thought was just a broke, self-declared queen—only to discover she was, in fact, the *Warden of Time* herself.\n\nAlongside that, came a game-changing revelation about the mystery of the Outlander, flipping the narrative on its head and solidifying the heroes' purpose: save the world.\n\n![Ours heroes against the Stain King: Chronos](/images-opt/chronos.webp)\n\nBut let’s be real.\n\nNo one cared about such a frivolous responsibility.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics says that entropy only increases—and if you’ve been following this story, you’d know that law hasn’t missed a single day. Things have only gotten messier since day one.\n\nGonathon with a G—a knight known for his humility, his generosity, his unwavering care—somehow managed to steal Elizabeth’s crown for the biggest fumble of the season. His performance in today’s love drama was so generational, so chaotic, that comparisons were made. To what? *\"A goat being washed\"*. That's how bad it got.\n\nThe knight in orange cooked up a love story so convoluted that most around him either gave up entirely or begged not to be involved. Those unlucky enough to be roped in—yes, even the queen he once served loyally—became collateral damage. Gonathon G? More like *onathon*, because no **G**irls would dare take this person's hands.\n\n![Moments before the \"goat\" fell off](/images-opt/goat.webp)\n\nYet, in the eye of the storm, peace still existed.\n\nElizabeth spent quiet time in her forge, chatting with the voices in her head. Nerissa kept grinding, forever in pursuit of her beloved potato salad. And right in the middle of all the chaos, tucked humbly into the heart of the build zone, stood a cozy little cafe. A cafe that didn’t chase profit, but offered delicious food, handmade with love and fluff. Waiting. Always waiting. Not for gold or fame—but just to make someone smile.\n",

The objective hadn’t changed: gather resources for building, materials for cooking, and, if possible, find at least one person to accompany her. Because without her usual fuzzy companion by her side, this journey had felt... somber.\n\nAnd as if the world heard her silent plea, a small, feathery friend arrived.\n\n[Hello there, little one!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=Go2F6QDRR0qDVuZC&t=1177)\n\nA chicken. An animal Fuwawa held close to her heart. Her previous journey had revolved almost entirely around tending to flocks, nurturing and loving them as family. To have that feeling return—however small—was like a gentle breeze to a tired soul.\n\nThe chicken was mischievous, tiny, always [darting around](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=2wRpax8PI0MsZJg6&t=1331) at the first chance. Fuwawa had to think of countless ways to keep him from escaping. But once he was secured within the cozy café, she named him *Moco-chan*, a quiet homage to the companion she missed dearly.\n\nFeeling a little more grounded, Fuwawa turned her sights to progress. She reached out to others for help in catching up with the dungeons. First came the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=J38XCoSl-nVt5AHh&t=1863). Then, she joined Shiori, Mococo, and Bae in the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=AMeAFfmmilO48tEp&t=4763). Together, they recovered the memories of [Ouro Kronii](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=2vIMbyUxKOHbQ2y5&t=8554).\n\nThen it was back to work on her café. Materials were still needed, and thankfully, [Shakira](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=a98N053xbj--51z9&t=3509) offered stones to help with construction. Things were looking up. The little owner had [no sales](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=2WqV9LXEoUfycxxp&t=3849) yet, but she was hopeful. Her dream still shimmered in the distance—and for once, she wasn’t alone. Moco-chan was with her.\n\n[Moco-chan~](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=MON2jav5merqyE4a&t=3907)\n\nAt least, for a short time.\n\n[Moco...chan?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=qZPau0VzbYTi2o2i&t=9171)\n\nFuwawa stepped out for errands, and when she returned... Moco-chan was gone.\n\nShe ran. Panicked. Calling out. Searching every corner of the area. But there was no sign of him. Had he wandered too far? Was he okay? Would he come back?\n\nShe told herself not to blame him. She could never. If he didn’t want to stay, she wouldn't force him. Fuwawa only ever wanted the best for others. That’s who she was. But pretending it didn’t hurt? That would be a lie.\n\nShe ended the day as always—writing in her journal. But this entry weighed heavier than the rest.\n\nHer shop stood open, but no one had come to buy anything. Visitors were rare. And when they *did* stop by, it was to ask for something... or to advertise. Not to sit. Not to chat. Not to stay.\n\nHer dream was starting to flicker. The other chefs were so talented. So successful. Could she ever catch up?\n\nThe café was empty. And Fuwawa sat in that emptiness.\n\n[Bau bau...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=LCtvw4QaRwM0kijj&t=11917)\n\nBut even in a space like that... there was still [hope](https://www.youtube.com/live/wCysZh57Hcc?si=amYBd0PYc_tTX567&t=18155).",

And with dreams of swimming in gold already sparkling in her mind, it made perfect sense why she was so eager to clock in.\n\nBut before cashing out, she had some catching up to do. The investigation of the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=mlKGQ7NhgMZ73vBu&t=1871) was still a blank in her itinerary, so she called in reinforcements. With the help of Immerkind, Bijou, Gonathon, and Ina, she powered through and got herself up to speed with the rest of the kingdom.\n\nWhile waddling about afterwards, she happened upon a *very* public therapy session between Mordon and Gonathon. And by “happened upon,” we mean she straight-up eavesdropped, no shame in sight. Though one might question whether it even *was* therapy, considering the kind of advice being handed out.\n\n[There's a window here, yeah?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=1b0WCfas_RRaMR8t&t=3322)\n\nThat’s when the lightbulb hit.\n\nWhy not become a therapist [herself](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=FdwTk8KAoS3pt2ch&t=3721)? Offer budget sessions with bargain-bin pricing and declare herself the most qualified while she’s at it—despite having no actual license or experience. None of that mattered. \n\nAfter planting her flag in the mental health business, she joined up with Shiori, Bae, and Fuwawa to tackle the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=zHdcA0uQyy3zuFUw&t=4759).

Her client? Shakira.\n\n[Follow your heart!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=-ZizHO6g5xCSHEr9&t=9493)\n\nShakira poured her heart out, detailing the mess she’d created by accidentally setting up a blind date between Mordon and Gonathon—based on a complete misunderstanding—and triggering a love triangle that caught Shiori in the emotional crossfire. It was a web of drama spiraling out of control, and she was at a loss on what to do.\n\nEnter Mococo: therapist extraordinaire. She listened carefully, took in the drama, and then dropped her sage wisdom: *“Follow your heart.”* Short. Vague. Possibly meaningful.\n\nThen she asked for her payment. Then she hung up.\n\nAnd that, folks, was therapy.\n\nShe closed her day with pride, documenting everything she’d accomplished—highlighting, of course, the mountain of money she raked in from [shop sales](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=ngAzUQ4nmccPecin&t=10939), her paycheck, and her very first therapy gig.

With each step forward, her journey was beginning to take shape. It may have started on rocky footing, sure, but with new knowledge earned and kind souls met—chief among them the mighty phoenix who had helped her so much—Elizabeth now felt steadier, more grounded, and more determined than ever to keep moving forward. And of course, in the midst of all the day’s events, her moments with Nerissa stood out—moments she hoped to see more of today (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Frame By Frame](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-2-left-2)).\n\n[Log 0002](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=miuGcqt46LMF_GCh&t=95)\n\nHer morning began much like the previous one, with her ever-dependable sugar phoenix once again offering assistance for a major task: investigating the Stronghold of Ruin. Before setting off, Elizabeth took a brief tour around the kingdom, admiring the creations people had built—and couldn’t help but feel a strange déjà vu seeing enormous [floating text](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=gbwqdZGPxPB_RjoQ&t=651) in the sky again.\n\nThe dungeon itself was conquered with success, and with the mission complete, she moved on to gathering materials. During a brief lull, Elizabeth checked in with [Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=ZHTbaG0Zv_dYDNx4&t=5606), who had tried to contact her earlier. What followed was a friendly—if somewhat bizarre—back-and-forth full of playful jabs, as the two debated their way of addressing each other: one being a knight and the other being a witch.\n\nShiori also took the opportunity to promote her growing business, selling \"memories\"—detailed records of each day’s journey. Elizabeth, intrigued, bought a few and read through them, raising a suspicious brow with each entry. \n\n[Her writing is this fire?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=a1GZJG59uOdXfzBc&t=11809)\n\nAs the day continued, Elizabeth focused on improving her forge, even constructing a hidden underground bunker to safely store her goods. Of course, she had a secondary motive too: a perfect place to [prank people](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=ewOxwttSz3l0BUTO&t=22074) without being caught.\n\nShe wrapped up the first half of her day on a warm, wholesome note—spending quiet, meaningful time with Nerissa, as their bond continued to deepen.\n\n---\n**Part 2**\n\nTired and slightly sleepy, Elizabeth still did her best to keep up with her journal. Thoughts wandered to her Jade Forge, to her old animal companions from journeys past—silly memories, sure, but they made her heart ache in a warm, nostalgic way. \n\nBut just as she wrapped up her writing, a sudden flash of thought pierced through her mind. Ominous. Unsettling. A message that lingered longer than it should have.\n\n[\"Are they with you or against you\"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/1tE2N1kP2YA?si=IEaSGDXxGSpZj8xf&t=198)\n\n\nNow then, Elizabeth was *literally alone* in the kingdom at the time. So of course the most logical next step was to challenge a dungeon designed for a full party of adventurers.\n\nElizabeth managed to solve the first puzzle, pushing through with a spark of brilliance and stubborn will—\n...and then she ran out of time.\n\nAnd then she went bye bye.\n",

She worried that 2 knights would not be enough but, despite the difficulty, they prevailed.\n\nShe would return to an interesting scene as howls could be heard just outside of [Mordan Ramsay's Tavern](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=653). It seemed the Pack is bonding quite well despite the moon not out.\n\nA newly built house in the distance that sent Kiara quite a [tickle](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=782). It reminded her fondly of one she had previously built and though Ina was a bit crossed, both would laugh and parted ways merrily. Kiara appreciated her own forge, marvelling the paintings Elizabeth put up and the improvements made. She was astounded by the [Shrine of Love](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=1038) and wondered if the Elizabeth and Nerissa had progressed their relationship in Kiara's short absence. The basement was another wonderful addition to the forge along with amusing journals framed on the wall.\n\nKiara saw her very dear cousin Immerkind (questionably related?) and complimented Cecilia's new hat but also expressed the she missed seeing Cecilia's head. The conversation would turn to Cecilia's plight yesterday and her woes and Kiara gently scolded her for the [alcoholism](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=1665). Kiara would offer her protection for the dungeon and Cecilia will inform her if there is a spot on her party later.\n\nKiara's love was put to the test when she stumbled on Gonathan's therapy session with Mordan. Her fellow orange knight told her that, unfortunately, Cecilia was against cousin romances. Despite this, Kiara would persevere! She will find a way to win Cecilia over. With that in the back of hermind, Kiara whisphered in turn about the blind date she set up for Gonathan.\n\nBut it seemed there is more to worry about Cecilia. First was Cecilia's loan from Bae that had a 100% interest rate. Second, the special \"interest\" Bae might have towards her cousin (now apparently blood-related) and... Cecilia's own flattery to the Peasant's advances? Is this another barrier for Kiara to win Cecilia's heart? Only *time* can tell.\n\nBut speaking of Time! It is Time for Kiara to enter The Chronos Dungeon. Here, their grasp of timing was put to the test. Conquering through their confusion, they soon defeated Stain King Chronos and found another treasured disc in the meanwhile. Soon another memory unfolds before them: Tammy's.\n\nA Queen she was and regal she still is. Kiara couldn't help but admire her with the rest. But there are more important matters:  The Blind Date. The responsibility felt heavy on Kiara's shoulders, she promised Gonathan and she would see the date to its hopefully successful conclusion.\n\nAh. The Knight was so consumed by the date that she forgot to report matters to the Princess! But before Kiara could finish her report, Shiori interrupted with a small concern. She spoke of the blind date between Gonathan and Calli... but Shiori was interested in Gonathan. It seems matters are [complicated](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8573).\n\n[Turmoil stirred in Kiara's noble heart.](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8832)\n\nConfounded. Concerned. Fear of ruining an already blossoming love. She called Mococo for therapy but the advice 'follow your heart' could not simply solve the dilemma Kiara inadvertently created. How could she follow her heart when its path is unclear? She would ask Mordan if she was still interested in Gonathan and... [Mordan is ready for the date](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=9226). This is the best day of my life, Mordan exclaimed, to Kiara's growing horror.\n\nAs the date began, Kiara asked Shiori to watch the blind date with her, in case the love between the other Knight and Chef was not meant to be. Was it a bright idea to invite Shiori, who was clearly interested Gonathan, to the event? The short answer is 'no'. The longer answer: Shiori would dramatically pretend to drown, interrupting the date which would led *Mordan* to dive in to save her. [It got complicated](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=9745). The Good Knight is too popular for his own good.\n\nKiara fretted as everything around her burnt. Mordan proposed to Gonathan. Shiori rescued Gonathan from the dreaded **berry bush**. The silence from Gonathan was astounding as he cried to Tammy about [his woes](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10281). In the meanwhile, Shiori and Mordan would have a [simple non-blind date](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10111) but there is no 'spark' to be found between them.\n\nBut then, it seemed well. Gonathan seemed to have made a [choice](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10733). For a moment, all is right. A ring is given to Shiori. Then, without a shred of awareness and the naivete the size of Kronii's ego, [Gonathan took the trophy and threw it on the ground](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10733). Kiara would not be privy to more as the couple decided to resolve it privately.\n\nSo caught Kiara was with the drama that she forgot to do her jobs as a hero and as a smithy, quickly selling her wares and finishing her reports to Fia. *The Outlander and The Outsider* were the same! An ill-fated hero, punished by the gods. The news broke Iphania's own heart as well. Today is a terrible day for love.\n\nBut still, Kiara went through her day. Exploring the new area and soon acquring a diamond pickaxe which was soon upgraded by Cecilia. She herself would be selling the new legendary upgrade stones at a [very affordable price](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=13082).\n\nKiara traded her legendary upgrade stones for Bijou's legendary charms, Kiara couldn't help but pour her out to a friendly ear [and, accidentally, within hearing range of the couple in question](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14507). But it seemed they did not truly hear what Kiara said as they're having a dispute of their own.\n\nAgain, mesmerised by the flames of shattering love, Kiara watched it all [unfold](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14970) and heart-wrenched that her own hand, by which she swore to defend others with, had no small part in creating this drama that ultimately ended in Gonathan's broken heart. Even after burning herself at the campfire and turning into a ghostly phoenix for a moment, Kiara agonised the course of day. Her own failed endeavors towards kind cousin, the fumbled date between Gonathan and Mordan. Perhaps, Kiara's love was to be an appreciation for life.\n\nAll this she wrote on her journal. But, even if her goals were not met, it doesn't mean that others should suffer an equally miserable day. She paid her dues to Mococo, expressed to Shiori how Kiara had misunderstood her at first and now sees the kindness in her, and [buying a significant amount of food from Fuwawa's shop](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=18238). Unperfect Kiara may be, let it be known that her kindess is unfaltering.",

            "title": "Peasant Da Bae",
            "content": "It was a brilliant morning for Peasant The Bae, a peasant with a whopping 13K gold, as she woke up to begin her day. She met others and they too would return her pleasantries, commenting on her new hat she had bought the previous day. Truly, the hearts of those around Bae as they [kindly inquire how she felt](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=428).\n\n[Peasant Partner Loan (PP)](#embed:https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=1188)\n\nBae knew what it felt like to be poor, she was coinless just a few days ago, and thought, there might be others similar to her that might be need of some coin. With this in mind, in addition to tHE dUMPSTER, PP Loans for those in need. Of course, as Bae experienced, nothing in life comes for free and the interest rates of 150% (at a variable rate) is only fair  (to be paid back within 2 business days including day of first lent). Those who don't pay back? Well, Bae can be persistent.\n\nLearning a lesson from The Gacharm's Roa, Bae would set up advertisements of her own, smartly styling each ad differently before quickly sending it out. Except to one; As a special courtesy, Peasant The Baa called the ever kind Immerkind to tell Cecilia about the newly opened PP Loan. Cecilia would receive a special rate of 100% and borrowed 1,500 gold. \n\nBae met the Hot Pink One telling her about the new service she offers. Though like alwats, the two would then gloat about their respective wealth, to up the other, and traded barbs. Bae would refute the [Hot Pink One's accusation of Bae running a scam](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=3711).\n\nSoon others would inquire about Bae's heath. Still rather worried, Gonathan and Bijou would ask a single question: If a wagon was to travel down trail but caught between two roads; in one way is a baby, who would only lived until 5, and the other had 5 elderly people, each having 1 year left to live, who would Bae choose to condemn? They fretted as Bae pondered her answer but calmed when she answered 'I would stop the wagon'. But when pushed to choose, Bae would ultimately decided to condemn the *baby* for [they have to kill a baby anyways](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=4026). As she answered, Bae entered a strange trance but seemed to return to normal.\n\nThough unsure why her friends seemed troubled, Bae turned her attention to the day's current challenge: The Chronos Dungeon. Time. Rewind. Pause. The machinations of the dungeon would confuse our heroes the previous one couldn't as they made their way through. But at last, at the end only Stain King Chronos stood in their way. Like the challenges of the dungeon itself, Time was in his grasp but it was not enough. Soon another memory, Tammy's, would unevail.\n\n[Tammy was a Queen!](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=8275) And a Time Warden, but Bae was astounded that she was in the presence of royalty all this time! But, now Bae worried - what if her own memories wouldn't be up to par? In a rare moment of comradery, IRyS echoed this sentiment. How could the Hot Pink One compare? She was drunk compared to *that*? Tammy would comfort them and reaffirm the Hot Pink One is a goddess no matter what and while it seemed that Tammy was still her same kind self, Bae gasped when Tammy, Queen Tammy, called them *plebians*. Bae may be a peasant but that is an honourable title! She got it from her mother who got it from her mother who got it from her mother. The Queen might soon turn a tyrant and turn the kingdom into a dictatorship.\n\nWith heavy hearts at their friend's change, they report back to the Princess and learnt that the ruination still spreads and the kingdom is still in danger. And as they report to Fia the cat would reveal a further upsetting news: The Outlander is the Outsider! Once The Watcher, he interfered in Libestal's fate and angered the gods (who is not IRyS). The Outsider is a true hero, only turning evil from the years of imprisonment for interfering with fate. \n\nDespite the rough events, a silver lining was found: Diamonds. Bae found her skills as a supplier only grew and the culmination of her hard work draws near...\n\n[PICK OF POWER (PP)](#embed:https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=11740)\n\nA diamond pickaxe. One maxed out to its true potential. Truly, Peasant The Bae has come so far and now her hard work has paid off. Her mother would be proud. And just like how she bears the Peasant title proudly, Bae will never forget her roots; as she finished her new axe Axe of Power (AP), she frames PP and PA in workshop. Her business would also provide this upgrade at a reasonable price, Ina being her first customer, and selling the newly found ore, Enigmatic Stones, to Bijou for a sale price. She also tried to offer her services to Queen Tammy but it seems the questionably good queen has no need of it at the moment. She would then witness [Tammy yell at the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=12995) who promptly ran away.\n\nCecilia would successfully also pay back her loan at the end of the day. The two would converse about their business and Bae advised her that Cecilia's kind prices could afford to be raised since the labour to improve such tools is rather intensive. Kiara would also offer legendary upgrade stones at a cheap price, which Bae was shocked by. She bought 2, as she had promised Gonathan to buy his wares later.\n\nJust as Bae was about to go to bed, staying up late was something Mother would have disapproved, she quickly realised that there were a few chores left to be done. She quickly called Bijou to gacha a few charms, luckily winning her gambles, and would go to buy a legendary upgrade stone Gonathan to witness the [Good Knight's Marital Troubles](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=14642). Astounded, shocked, and confused, Bae wasn't sure what to do but the time was ticking, and she was already past her bedtime, she would interrupt the drama to quickly finish the trade with Gonathan and slept for the day, unaware of how the Knight's night would end.",

The ever-delicate, always-messy realm of love—specifically, the brand of love that involved siblings, mutual friends, and being roped into playing the role of wingman whether you wanted to or not.\n\nOf course, that wouldn’t be the last therapy session of the day. In fact, love became the centerpiece of nearly every conversation the two had throughout the rest of the date. Mordon, ever the professional (in theory), claimed she was simply offering her services—nothing more. Surely, she'd never get caught up in the tangled mess her clients kept dragging into these sessions… right?\n\n[Therapy session of questionable topics](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=4AnsPPNT_wg8l5Ml&t=215)\n\nLater, she joined Tam, Nerissa, and Gonathon for the day’s main mission—investigating the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=lAhFFA_4EjWnc_FJ&t=4562). And even within the time-twisting, memory-riddled dungeon, she somehow managed to sneak in another [therapy session](https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=P7SB05k5Jd07spd9&t=7538). \n\nWhen they recovered the memories of [Ouro Kronii](https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=SEplOgl1s3k3hXcx&t=7906)—who, to Mordon’s surprise, turned out to be the very Tam she was journeying with—Mordon wasted no time offering her [professional support](https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=1nQSEO7cubwb8rFH&t=8151) to the newly-remembered time goddess. \n\nHer eagerness wasn’t just business as usual though—turns out her monopoly was under threat.

But with prices so low it hurt. \n\n[She doesn't have a lisence](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=jllaYw_Lnzhq52cC&t=3403)\n\nBut the real twist came when the very storylines she swore to avoid started dragging her in. Remember all that messy romantic drama Gonathon kept rambling about in therapy? Yeah, Mordon suddenly found herself cast as the “destined love” in a blind date stunt cooked up by her own client—resulting in complete chaos for Gonathon’s actual crush (see [Calli-Gonathon: A Powerful Dynamic](#edge:mori-calliope-gonathon-g-bottom-1-bottom-3)).\n\nAnd what did Mordon do after throwing the whole table into the air?\n\nShe just... left. Off to attend to other business, casually leaving the chaos in her wake.\n",

She had been eyeing one humble knight ever since their first encounter during a past journey, and it seemed those feelings were starting to solidify. Despite her original intentions—manipulating him for her own gain—things had changed. Somewhere along the way, she might’ve actually fallen for him.\n\nSo naturally, she started her day by infiltrating a therapy session and eavesdropping on her crush.\n\nGotta show you care, right?\n\n[Sneak 100](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=kxtX6JlJhKG0uDhE&t=668)\n\nOutside of all that, Shiori had a proper mission today like everyone else: to investigate the [Star Site: Chronos dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=lhZpQ8N-1lD_eYDy&t=2014). Teaming up with Bae, Fuwawa, and Mococo, the group overcame the conquest and recovered long-lost memories of [Ouro Kronii](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=IaJKKnb-D4y6qJfY&t=5814).\n\nAnd right as she stepped out of the dungeon, Gonathon—who was on a different team—emerged around the same time. Shiori, seizing the moment, dragged him off for a little one-on-one time.\n\n[Just the two of us](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=d0aIf-aCyYQrcc5X&t=5985)\n\nHe was kind, honest, and pure—everything she admired. And she knew that if she didn’t make a move soon, her chance might slip away. So, upon learning that Shakira had arranged a [blind date](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=I8E4D1s69cbSEPwP&t=6398) for Gonathon, she approached the phoenix and, in her classic tsundere manner, asked to take the mystery slot.\n\nBut that seat was already filled. Due to a major misunderstanding, Shakira had placed Mordon in the date slot, believing she had feelings for Gonathon.\n\nStill, Shiori wasn’t one to give up so easily. She had a plan: crash the date and steal Gonathon’s heart.\n\n[Ahhh! I'm drowning!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=G-v3Mv7AulkgIwP3&t=7526)\n\nBut things didn’t go how she’d hoped. Even after laying her heart bare, it all unraveled quickly (see [Shiori-Gonathon: The Witch’s Trials](#edge:gonathon-g-shiori-nyavella-top-2-bottom-1)).\n\nThen, as if fate herself had taken pity on the heartbroken maiden, an old acquaintance—someone once dear—approached to help ease the pain. The two shared a long, heartfelt conversation, reflecting on the bond they once shared (see [Shiori-Bijou: Severed, but still there](#edge:shiori-nyavella-koseki-bijou-top-1-bottom-4)).\n\nShiori closed out her day by journaling everything: her hopes, her heartbreak, and her thoughts on what might lie ahead.\n\n[Hurtful, but still hopeful](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=hY1jLc2nVd9MTUO6&t=14316)",

This would last for several minutes.\n\nThis was the least of her troubles today. Far from it. In fact, the little princess was intertwined with a lot of the day’s drama. She even reconnected with a few people along the way. Especially with one she thought she wouldn’t get a chance to reconcile with.\n\nNinoIna returned after being absent from the day before. Blissfully unaware of what happened yesterday, she tried roping her sister to become one with the potato. Bijou agreed, but in turn tried to get her to become one with the bread. …To no avail. Bijou could stay in-bread though! (See [Ina-Bijou: Wooden Potato](#edge:koseki-bijou-nino-ina-the-hot-purple-one-right-2-left-2)) \nSeems like not many people bought into the bread cult thing, and her sister was no exception.\n\nBefore going to Star Site: Chronos, Immerkind and Bijou went exploring to kill Stains in the second area. It’s at this point where she started calling Bijou “Chibi-hime”.\n\nReturning from the slaying session, Bijou comes across the Peasant and checks up on her mental state with that Stain hat on… [It doesn’t look too good for her.](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=4287)\n\nThe Peasant’s memories were failing her? Is the Corruption at risk of spreading here too? She felt the need to speak with someone about this. Having discussed this matter with Gonathan earlier, she immediately called him up. She discovered that she was in the middle of a therapy session with Mordan Ramsey; she didn’t care and butted in like a kid getting an adult’s attention.\n\nMordan offered to give her two cents, but only after Bijou paid 100 coins (which she agreed upon as long as she got a snack from her—again, very child-like). The reaper suggests they try tricking the Peasant into giving up that cursed hat somehow in a trade. If that doesn’t work, Calli would gladly take her into The Basement to forcibly take it off.\n\nSpeaking of The Basement, Bijou wanted to finally see it for herself, as part of her therapy. She would NEARLY get inducted into The Wolf Pack… if only she wasn’t an in-bread. Regardless, Gonathan agreed to fight the corruption alongside her, should the need arise.\n\n[Couples’ Therapy with Gonathan](#embed:https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=4396)\n\nAs if nothing happened preceding, Gonathan joined forces with Bijou to revisit the Stronghold of Ruin, helping Ina, Fuwawa, and Mococo out going through it for the first time. \n\nShe would later join IRyS, Immerkind, Kiara, and Ina to investigate the day’s dungeon, Star Site: Chronos. It was there where they would recover the memories of Tam Gandr, or Ouro Kronii. With her memories restored, everyone returned from the dungeon worshipping her. In the midst of it all, Princess Bijou blurted, “Does that make you my mom?” (see [Bijou-Kronii: Not Again...](#edge:koseki-bijou-tam-gandr-top-2-top-2))\n\nFollowing the dungeon, Bijou immediately sets out to find new materials for the best charms—Legendary Charms using Enigmatic Stones that kind of look like the gem on her chest. Perhaps it was fate that she became a Jeweler after all. \n\nBack at Gacharms, Kiara would visit to fulfil their trade relationship, patiently waiting in line for Bae to finish her pulls. She would end up [spilling tea](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=18313) to Bijou about a blind date he put Gonathan and Mordan on. It fell apart after she realized at the last moment that Gonathon had fallen for Shiori instead, who *appeared during said date…* causing a chain reaction.\n\nThey suddenly started hearing voices above them… It was Gonathan and Shiori on the roof. Unbeknownst to Kiara and Bijou, there was *already* an update to Kiara’s gossip that had transpired during her entire talk. Bijou was fine letting Gonathan and Shiori continue to use the roof of the shop. The interaction that ensued on the roof set off its own chain reaction caused by a misunderstanding, and eventually… a divorce (see [Gigi-Shiori: The Witch’s Trials](#edge:gonathon-g-shiori-nyavella-top-2-bottom-1)).\n\nSeveral people watched the breakup happen before their eyes, behind the glass windows of Shiori’s house. Bijou couldn’t help feeling sad seeing Shiori cry, so she came to her side soon after. She took this opportunity to reconcile with her past and get back with her. She wanted to mend Shiori’s twice-broken heart. She also felt bad about abandoning their child Khaos and vowed to bring him back (see [Bijou-Shiori: Severed, but still there](#edge:shiori-nyavella-koseki-bijou-top-1-bottom-4)).\n\nNow Bijou has double the motivation for what she vented about to Mordan and Gonathan. There was a moral need to get the Peasant to give up that Stain hat. This would ultimately be for everyone’s sake… but especially her own, to fix her relationship with Shiori. It's not just a (cursed) hat; it was her child. Their child. How she’ll do it… is a problem for another time.\n\nShe spent the rest of the day gathering materials, all the while pondering if she should confess to Gonathan about her feelings about Shiori. He had forgotten all about their previous adventure in the illusory version of Libestal. She figured that she didn’t want Gonathan to feel bad about taking her girl, so she had to say *something* about it.\n\nThey both agreed to meet back at Gacharm, and it’s there where Bijou confessed about her rekindled love for Shiori. The entire truth came out, and Gonathan seemed to be understanding, despite looking troubled and pacing around in place.\n\n[“...We were, in fact, betrothed.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=21191)\n\nBijou was the last one around for the day, working overtime to make sure the shop was ready for the next day. Nobody would be around to hear her practice [howling… “like a pup”](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=22518). She may have more than that dawg in her after all.\n\nShe also left exactly [8008 coins](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=23011) in her pocket. Just for laughs. We all needed it after what had transpired this day; herself and the voices in her head. [Maybe Fuwawa could smile a bit too.](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=22932)\n\n[“JOURNAL DAY 4”](#embed:https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=23356)",

The day begin simply enough, with the humble knight visiting Gacharms to acquire new equipment. Chief on Gonathon’s mind was the suspected corruption of Peasant the Bae, which soon extended to Princess Bijou upon learning of her past corruption (see [Bijou-Gonathon: A Rock and a Hard Place](#edge:gonathon-g-koseki-bijou-left-3-left-3)). These concerns had to be set aside, as an encounter with Immerkind led to Gonathon becoming once again conflicted of the [role](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=21m13s) she had played in Immerkind’s delusional pursual of the Princess. (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Kind and the Humble Knight](#edge:cecilia-immerkind-gonathon-g-left-2-right-2))\n\nHer search for solace led her to Mordan Ramsey who, after some haggling, agreed to become Gonathon’s therapist (see [Mordan-Gonathon: A Powerful Dynamic](#edge:mori-calliope-gonathon-g-bottom-1-bottom-3)). It was during their discussions that Mordan revealed that not only was the [Pearl](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=1h23m45s) someone very close to Gonathon, but was in fact her former lover who had since disappeared. \n\n[I was called…a diamond…](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h17m53s)\n\nGonathon had little time to ponder these revelations, as she joined Tam Gandr, Nerissa, and Mordan in tackling the next dungeon, [Star Site: Chronos](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=1h44m14s). The puzzles and boss proved to be formidable challenge, but they paled in comparison to what came next. Upon the Stain King’s fall, a flood of memories returned to Gonathon: that Tam Gandr was in fact the Queen of Libestal from their timeline and a powerful Time Warden. Returning to Libestal, Tam and Gonathon shared a heartfelt reunion, with both affirming their ironclad bond and Gonathon pledging to stand by Tam no matter what (see [Gonathon-Kronii: The Queen’s Gambit](#edge:tam-gandr-gonathon-g-right-2-bottom-1)). \n\n[You will always be my queen!](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=2h43m48s)\n\nFrom here things took a turn for the dramatic, with Shiori of the Nyavellas at the center of it all (see [Gonathon-Shiori: Trials of the Witch](#edge:gonathon-g-shiori-nyavella-top-2-bottom-1)). For while Gonathon and Shiori's newfound love was still just beginning to blossom, this love would be stretched all the way to the breaking point. For the destined blind date set up by Shakira finally occurred, with [Gonathon’s date being none other than Mordan Ramsey!](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h11m48s) Things only got worse as Shiori, seeking to observe the date, began to drown and had to be saved by Mordan. As the two rivals for Gonathon’s affection started to quarrel, the hapless knight couldn’t take the pressure and fled. It was here that Gonathon’s lack of decisiveness and blind loyalty reared its ugly head, as the knight begged for Tam Gandr to not only provide advice, but also to [directly observe and live with her and Shiori as a way of preventing any misdeeds on her part.](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h28m55s)\n\n[Devote yourself to me…no matter the consequences](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h51m2s)\n\nWhile Tam agreed to assist, all of this was too much for Shiori. She decided to test Gonathon to prove her devotion, and eventually formed a soul pact with her and they briefly became husband and wife. A meeting with Immerkind led to some more [words of wisdom](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h23m50s) from the green wolf: That even if Gonathon’s memories were not the same as they were in the past, that deep down Gonathon was still the same person. The two wolves vowed to escape this timeline together, their bond stronger than ever. \n\n[Love is when you spend time together and laugh!](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h19m42s)\n\nAlas, none of this was enough to overcome Gonathon’s crippling dedication to her queen and inability to make her own decisions. For upon returning home, Gonathon encountered what seemed to be a startling scene: [Tam Gandr and Shiori engaging in an affair!](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h31m02s) But rather than seek answers from the two, the bumbling knight chose to once again flee, an act which, along with Shiori [falling to her death](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h36m00s) while trying to explain to Gonathon, completely broke the battered witch and led to her ending her romance with Gonathon. \n\nDevastated and overcome with regret, Gonathon’s final moments of the day were spent being consoled by Tam Gandr. The queen urged Gonathon to think carefully about her feelings and who she truly loved. But despite all of these misfortunes and frustration that Gonathon had inflicted on herself and others, Tam remained committed to Gonathon, and the two [parted on hopeful terms](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=5h6m45s). For hope was now something that Gonathon needed more than anything, and in her daily journal she once again reflected on those that she loved and had loved. She ended by expressing a desire to make tomorrow a better day. Godspeed, Gonathon G.\n\n[Writing her daily journal](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=5h28m35s)\n",

Nerissa’s, for example, looked as though she was opening her arms for a hug. Sure, Elizabeth still had a few awkward moments, but they were fewer now. The craftsmanship of Nerissa’s portrait was breathtaking, and paired with the subject—Nerissa in all her stunning glory—it was something Elizabeth wanted to frame for the world to admire... and for herself, most of all.\n\nShe placed the painting against the side of the building, gently illuminated by the warm glow of shroomlight. But there was still a bit of space left—just enough for one more. Her own portrait.\n\n[One next to each other](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=Q3_FM3XOHKxc6MBo&t=22779)\n\nElizabeth placed it next to Nerissa’s.

Unfortunately for Gonathon G., her inability to reconcile the love for her queen and the love for her newfound companion would inevitably lead to heartbreak. \n\nFollowing her return from Star Site: Chronos and the reaffirmation of her role as Tam Gandr’s loyal knight (see [Kronii-Gonathon: The Queen’s Gambit](#edge:tam-gandr-gonathon-g-right-2-bottom-1)), Gonathon began to feel conflicted over whether it was right for her to seek love while in the queen’s service. Dismissing these thoughts for the time being, Gonathon assured Shiori that the [strong affinity](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=2h50m6s) they had still endured, and Shiori in turn gifted Gonathon with a ring, further cementing their bond. \n\n[What if when my memories return I am not who I am?](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=2h52m33s)\n\nThese tender moments would not last long, as soon after Gonathon was called by Shakira to the destined blind date she had arranged with “the one who was perfected for Gonathon.” This was not Shiori however, but [Mordan Ramsey](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h11m48s) Gonathon’s fellow wolf and new therapist. Shiori, keen to keep an eye on Gonathon, snuck up on the date and began quarrelling over Gonathon’s heart with the pink therapist. This resulted in the first of Gonathon’s many fumbles, as the hapless knight chose to [flee and seek direction from Tam Gandr](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h18m18s) rather than address the issue herself. \n\nUpon Gonathon’s return, Shiori expressed her reservation about the knight’s commitment. Indulging in her more manipulative and wily side, the witch announced that she was going to require Gonathon to [prove her devotion](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h39m36s) which included finishing the roof of her house and for the knight to swear to do anything Shiori asked for. While Gonathon was more than willing to accept, the knight had requirements of her own: that Tam Gandr live with them for at least a year and observe their relationship for any signs of misconduct. Reluctantly agreeing to these terms, the two held pinkies before briefly parting ways. \n\n[Devote yourself to me…no matter the consequences](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h51m2s)\n\nUnfortunately, it was here that their budding romance was savagely nipped. For upon returning to her home, Gonathon found her queen and her wife seemingly engaged in an [affair](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h31m02s) on their bunk bed. Unwilling to wait for an explanation, the distraught knight fled, with Shiori in hot pursuit. Alas, the witch slipped and fell to her death, which deeply shocked Gonathon. The worst was yet to come, for Shiori accused Gonathon of pushing her to her demise, and it was this final act that served as the catalyst for the witch severing their romance for good. \n\nAny hopes Gonathon had of redeeming herself in Shiori’s eyes were quickly dashed, as Koseki Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Rock and a Hard Place](#edge:gonathon-g-koseki-bijou-left-3-left-3) explained to Gonathon that she had rekindled her past romance with Shiori, one that the gem was keen to not see break again. And thus, Gonathon’s second foray into love ended in tragedy. It remains to be seen if the humble knight has learned anything from this heartbreak, as it is lessons like these that will be needed in the days ahead.",

This was quickly interrupted by a gaggle of peasants who, having witnessed Tam’s power in the memory, were now seeking to get into her good graces. This sycophancy was short-lived, as the Breads soon attempted to spark a coup to depose Tam. Immediately rushing to her side, Gonathon reassured Tam that she would always support her, which deeply moved Tam.\n\n[You will always be my queen!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/BSPi8sTHdAY?si=k33dxJgsRB5jPFyu&t=9770)\n\nThe darker side of their bond soon reared its ugly head, as Gonathon’s memories of Tam included a supposed Pact of Celibacy she had taken, which flew straight in the face of her burgeoning relationship with Shiori of the Nyavellas (see [Gonathon-Shiori: Trials of the Witch](#edge:gonathon-g-shiori-nyavella-top-2-bottom-1)). Now deeply conflicted, Gonathon would call on Tam several times to provide guidance and permission. This included intervention in a quarrel between Mordan Ramsey and Shiori following a blind date gone wrong and came to a head when Gonathon requested that Tam not only supervise her relationship with Shiori, but live with them on the top bunk for at least a year. Unwilling to lose her most treasured and only knight, Tam agreed to the [proposal](https://www.youtube.com/live/BSPi8sTHdAY?si=GZzaSx6FFBlTbIpm&t=12615). \n\nDespite Tam’s best (and worst) efforts, a critical misunderstanding shattered Shiori and Gonathon’s relationship: as she was inspecting the sleeping arrangements with Shiori, a hapless Gonathon witnessed what appeared to be an affair between the two and fled. This led to Shiori giving chase and falling to her death, an action which caused her to break off her romance with Gonathon. \n\nIn spite of all of this turmoil, Tam and Gonathon remained committed to one another, with Tam consoling Gonathon and confronting her about her relationship with Mordan Ramsey and Gonathon telling Tam of the wondrous statue the knight had built for her in the future. In a day filled with darkness and grief, the queen’s return was one of the sole shining lights for the knight, but it remains to be seen whether this bond will endure.",

And what mattered now… was the present.\n\n[Rock hard for you](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=fQJJmgoe94G0lyb7&t=12979)\n\nAfter experiencing heartbreak—after reaching out to someone she thought she could capture the heart of—Shiori was left reeling. It was then that Bijou came to offer her condolences. There were no grand gestures, no theatrics, just quiet honesty.\n\nThe two reminisced. About the laughter. The sadness. The adventures they’d shared. About the child they once had together. The conversation was soft, grounded—real. And in that stillness, something shifted. A moment that perhaps mended what was once cut. A thread that may yet be rewoven. Maybe, just maybe, there was a chance to begin again.\n",

While Gonathon was at first suspicious that Bijou herself might be corrupted, she was soon pacified by Bijou’s assurances and agreed to assist her against Bae should the peasant turn.\n\nSoon after, Gonathon brough Bijou to Mordan’s basement and introduced her to the [Wolf Pack](https://www.youtube.com/live/BSPi8sTHdAY?si=mVR0jSVdL_aFNKuq&t=2616). The knight explained that as the InBreads and Wolves were mortal enemies, that siding with one meant rejecting the other. While Bijou felt she had that dawg in her, she wasn’t sure of where her path lay at the moment. Not wishing to push her further, Gonathon reassured her that no matter what they would remain friends.\n \nSadly, the knight and gem’s interactions took a turn for the awkward later in the day when, following Gonathon’s disastrous fumbling of her relationship with Shiori (See [Gonathon-Shiori: Trials of the Witch](#edge:gonathon-g-shiori-nyavella-top-2-bottom-1)), the distraught knight was informed by Bijou that not only had she recovered her own memories of her past, but that she and Shiori had reaffirmed their love for one another. While Gonathon does not seem to bear any ill will towards Bijou, this new development could not have come at a worse time. ",

Romance and drama continued to dominate the kingdom like an ever-thickening fog, only now it was messier, weirder, and tangled beyond belief.\n\nBefore diving into the chaos, the heroes took on what might be the final major dungeon: Star Site: Chaos. And true to its name, it was exactly that—chaotic. Unlike the previous dungeons, which had grand themes and solemn trials, this one felt more like a playground of silliness. \n\nPuzzles? More like party games. Deep concepts? Nah, just fun. And of course, luck was a major player—so even if the heroes performed flawlessly, they still had to pray the stars were on their side.\n\n![The heroes battling Stain King: Chaos](/images-opt/chaos.webp)\n\nNow, onto the real madness. Gonathon kind of redeemed himself. Shiori and Bijou reconnected. Elizabeth and Nerissa continued their little flirt-fest. Bijou and Bae ended up in a legal custody battle over their child. Tam, Roa, and the hot pink lady spiraled into a love triangle—with the pink one somehow claiming she was pregnant. And all the mentally scarred adventurers? They booked a session with Mordon the therapist… who promptly quit his job after realizing what she had to deal with.\n\n![Mordon’s therapy session](/images-opt/therapy.webp)\n\nYou following all that?

            "content": "Right from the start of the fifth day, Elizabeth already had company. She was greeted by [Roa and Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=490s)  —friendly morning hellos, headpats exchanged—until the blue bird lady popped in, completely ruining the mood (or more accurately, ruining Elizabeth’s ability to keep her composure).\n\nWith actual people around her this time—unlike the solitude of the day before—Elizabeth joined the gang to tackle the Star Site: Chronos dungeon. Upon completion, she recovered memories of Ouro Kronii and came to a simple yet powerful realization: having others around really did make all the [difference](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=6644s).\n\nNext came the Star Site: Chaos dungeon, presumably one of the last major ones and a particularly intriguing one, where the aspect of chance dictated the flow. Still, alongside Bijou, Shiori, and Nerissa, Elizabeth powered through and recovered the memories of [Hakos Baelz](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?si=1zrJ9s4OAUQLt_pm&t=9740).\n\nThen came a true test of strength and courage. The Outlander challenged Elizabeth to a duel—a trial to determine if the heroes were worthy of carrying the fate of the world. Though she stumbled a few times, Elizabeth held her ground and proved her worth.\n\nWith all the main tasks out of the way, the day slowly descended into madness. It started with a heartfelt conversation with [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=13255s), but somehow everything spiraled and the spotlight shifted to Nerissa. Even the gods themselves chimed in, calling out to Elizabeth to “give Nerissa a chance,” all due to a supposed misunderstanding that unfolded earlier in the day (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: No Room for Drama](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-2-left-2)). The cape of wisdom also made a return.\n\nOnce the chaos subsided, Elizabeth wound down, penned a letter to Shakira expressing her appreciation, and finally called it a day.\n",

            "content": "The events of yesterday lingered in Kiara's mind and it is with concern that Kiara asked Mordan for a private word. Underneath the Chef's Tavern, Kiara [inquired about Mordan's well-being](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=836); the blind-date had ended horribly for everyone, but especially for her fellow wolf. Mordan reassured her, that though she liked Gonathan, she would prioritised Gonathan's feelings. But seeing the way Mordan put aside her own feelings, seemingly burying it within, made Kiara concerned.\n\nIn the midst of their talk, Elizabeth, Kiara's Sugar Child, would come by to request a legendary upgrade stone - Kiara quickly provided and was delighted to guess that it was a gift meant for a [certain Raven](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1045) as the other woman would frequently leave gifts for Elizabeth. Elizabeth, flustered but didn't deny, left. \n\nThe conversation then turned to Gonathan and Mordan's attempts, as Gonathan's therapist, on helping the Good Knight remember his past - [to remember His Pearl](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1128) in order to lead him to the right direction. That a new love isn't what Gonathan needs, but companionship of others. Kiara wondered if Mordan was projecting her own feelings as she too felt that recently.\n\nKiara went back to her forge to see Nerissa bought something earlier. Elizabeth commented her surprise as she remembered Nerissa complained of being poor to which Kiara would playfully disagree; especially if one would compare Nerissa's wealth compares to Elizabeth's own. As her Sugar Matron, Kiara would [give money](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1419) to the other's thankful embarrassment. Kiara would also come across a rather [pretty pink panther](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1535) whom she would promise to go to the new dungeon later. \n\n[A Comrade remembering...](#embed:https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1587)\n\nAnd it seem Roa might remember something. Kiara of course knew they were part of the same guild before, but could it be a sign? Would her friend would remember their treasured bonds?\n\nKiara left for the newer Remnant fields to search for materials and the new Enigmatic Stones, commenting on the mysteriousness of the material compared to the more common ores. She met Mordan again, the Lorekeepers fighting together against the Stains before shortly, finding what seems to be [a grave for one called \"Anax\"](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=4045). A journal left on the grave revealed a tragic tale. \n\nAt the job hall, Kiara would meet Ina ask if she had received Kiara's letter. She did! [Ina would read out loud](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=4856). An apology for the slight yesterday and Ina would wave it off stating all is good, giving a potato as thanks.\n\nBy the wagon, Kiara found [Roa in a trance](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=5592). Perhaps a vision, one of Time, is coming back to her? While waiting for Roa to awaken, Kiara overhear Shiori's complaining to Nerissa, guessing it was about Gonathan. [Kiara could fix Shiori.](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=5673) Roa reawakens and Kiara would let her know they have found a group for the dungeon.\n\nBut it seems, it is not only Kiara and Shiori that are affected by the relationship Drama. Kiara would comfort Gonathan when [he overheard others were gossiping.](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=6300)\n\nAnd soon, the hour comes again, a new dungeon to dive, one with Chaos as its name. And Chaos it is, for though the challenges are simple in nature, they aren't in effort. More party games than fights, eventually the group would encounter the Boss, and as before, win the battle. Though... something's missed as luck was not on their side as they lucked out on the treasured disc.\n\nA chaotic memory unfolds: The Peasant The Bae's! Kiara likened the memory to her own, [fun and sillier to the memory's before](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=8602). Another connection would be how they helped others in simpler but still meaningful ways.\n\n\nBut it seems the fight is not over. As she reported to the Princess, the Outlander returned, and soon, his history - and fate - revealed. Now, [Kiara would prove her worth as a Knight and Hero](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=9733) against the Outlander, finishing the battle in her flaming Revelation. Now it seemed history shall diverge and the Outlander's fate may have finally been changed. She left the Princess and Outlander to alone, but before she does, A few questions would be asked:\n\n[*What Does Libestal Mean to You?* **TO SAVE THE LESBIANS!**](#embed:https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=9949)\n\nKiara noticed her fellow knight's struggle against the Outlander fight and offered to give her some equipment to help in the battle, [fulfilling that promise](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=10623) shortly after it was made. As she went to her forge, Nerissa passed by to see if there were legendary upgrade stones. Pleased by the earnings of the day, she would see to restock her wares.\n\nElizabeth then returned in [victory](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11357)! Besting the Outlander, totally on the first try of course. Kiara felt proud at Elizabeth's progressed. The Red Knight was already strong and to see her stronger was to be admired. \n\nBut unfortunately, a strength that caused a tense situation: [Knight Bloodflame would suddenly attack Nerissa, calling her a witch,](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11940) when the latter came by to see Elizabeth. Kiara quickly pulled Nerissa aside and [reassured her](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11984) that it is not Elizabeth's true feelings and there is fondness within the Red Knight's heart for the Blue Chef. Time is what Elizabeth needs. Kiara promised to wingman but... carefully this time.\n\nToday was a calmer day and perhaps tomorrow would be a nice day off.",

            "title": "Peasant Da Bae",
            "content": "Something is... *stirring* The Peasant The Bae thought. From where, she couldn't say. The child that is on her head? Inside her? Perhaps it is that. Visions, snapshots of a [face she almost grasped](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=824) but slipped through her fingers. Today would be a special one.\n\nThat is not the only thing Bae worried about. She called Gonathan to her PP Hole, to inquire about his well-being from yesterday's rather dramatic (love) affair and to ask for his advice. To Bae's relief, Gonathan seemed to be doing better and she would open her own heart: She is but a peasant, dumb (and poor) in many ways but especially in the matters of the heart. Her Mother never finished this lesson but ignorance did not stop her heart from stirring whenever she met the kind Immerkind. \n\n[A Peasant's Heart for One with a Kind Heart](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=1318)\n\nBae felt anguish as she knew [Immerkind's love for the Princess Iphania](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=1388), for how could a peasant, even one with more money, compare to royalty? Is this love?  Confused, Bae asked Gonathan for his advice. Gonathan hesitated, his own endeavour with love had proven... Complicated (See Gonathan's relationships), but, reminded Bae that she was there for Immerkind when others were not. Perhaps write a letter, he suggested, so Immerkind may read Bae's true feelings once she returns?\n\nGonathan brought up another point Bae hadn't consider: They are heroes of another land. Once their adventure is over, they *must* leave Libestal. What of Immerkind's heart then, when she would have to part ways with the Princess. Realising that perhaps that a lowly peasant might have a chance, Bae quickly took his advice and began fretting on what to write in her letter. Gonathan advised Bae to write what she told him, for what her heart spoke is what she felt and that is enough. A gift too wouldn't be a bad idea.\n\n[A letter and A 5000 gold Bouquet](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=1762)\n\nEmpowered, Bae quickly bought a letter to send but pondered on the gift. A ring, especially an expensive one, might prove too much, too soon. Flowers are  better option but which one? Bae faltered. 5000 gold for a bouquet of roses? Bae's love for Immerkind overcame her newly found appreciation for money and she bought the bouquet, swearing to swiftly earn the money back which camerather quick when Mordan Ramsey called Bae to commission a diamond pickaxe for 4000 gold.\n\nStill, Bae worried for what [comes after the Dungeon](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2262). The trepidatious feelings came back. Tammy once kind is now a Tyrant Queen calling them all 'peasants'. If Peasant The Bae's memories returned, would her feelings stay the same? It was letter best written before the adventure, to preserve her feelings on paper.\n\n[Dearest ImmerKind...](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2543)\n\nHer passion and love for Immerkind burnt like a thousand suns as she tenderly wrote on the parchment. Words flowed out like a steady river but soon found itself overflowing into the ocean as droplets of water flew into the sky like stars. Soon, the letter was done but was it good enough? She asked Gonathan and a few others to proofread the letter and was [gladdened by the positive reception](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3130), the Hot Pink One's notwithstanding by her rating of 6/10. \n\nThings are looking up, her letter approved and roses ready, when Bijou called. She first inquired about purchasing Enigmatic Stones and would quickly ask if they can negotiate in-person. Bae quickly agreed but then would come to slightly regret that decision; In the PP hole, Bijou revealed she remembered her past memories and... \n\n[The 'hat' on Bae's head is her's and Shiori's child, Khaos.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3580)\n\nBijou would quickly explain her past, her mistake, and of Shiori's inability to care for Khaos alone led to the child being abandoned before being picked up by Bae and then [ultimately asking for Khaos back to make amends with Shiori](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3620), to Ina's and the Hot Pink One's shock and Bae's disgust. Anger coursed through Bae as she told Bijou how she found Khaos alone, how **she** was the one who truly cared for her when no one else was there. This conversation would ultimately turn to Mordan's therapy since there is not Court available for the heroes to use.\n\n... After conquering the next dungeon, Star Site: Chaos. A dungeon that... **spoke** to Bae. There was an [overwhelming sense of familiarity with each challenge](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=4434). Each game was *beautifully chaotic*. There was no need for challenging puzzles or math questions, no need to prove your overwhelming might. Just enough luck to get a nice roll on a die.\n\n[**WAAAAZZZZUUUUUPPPP**](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSFZwinYaaU)\n\nBae wasn't a peasant - she helped out *peasants*, like Charlie! That brat, he took her dice and she can't really use her full powers now. Bae might need therapy later since there was much to unpack. But, despite her newly found identity, Bae would still be a [Peasant in Charlie's honour!](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=5680) \n\nBut all is not over, the Outlander found the source of Ruination in the Heart of the Ruins and then soon found out that unfortunate fate that will befall him if saves the world. He doubted her strength but Bae proved [her strength is more than enough to take his place](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6108). Another tender moment would be had as [Bae witnessed Fia's final memory return to her](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6316).\n\nThe adventure might be done but Bae's day isn't over as she completed Mordan's request for a diamond pickaxe, quickly calling the Chef for her services as a Therapist for the family dispute. Bae would wistfully remember Charlie as she worked, remembering memories from long ago. [But, then who was Mother?](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6505). Was Mother real? Or was perhaps Mother... Brother? Was 'Brother' Charlie? Bae couldn't understand why her memories were so conflicted.\n\nA feelingn that would ironically be mirrored in Bijou as the princess would call Bae for help; [Shiori, Bijou's beloved, and Gonathan were talking once again](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=10880) and Bijou must respect their privacy. Her distrust of Shiori in the past had led to her mistakes, ones that must not be repeated. Though the custody of Khaos was still in dispute, Bae was still Bijou's friend and loyal customer, receiving splendid charms earlier, and affirmed that Bijou should trust Shiori. Seeing that Bijou was still in conflict, Bae immediately suggested to counselling since Mordan's free.\n\nBae would quickly go to Mordan's Therapy and had a brief solo therapy. After explaining her side of the story, including the spicy drama of the current state of the Shiori-Bijou relationship, Mordan would explain her idea: to trick the couple with a fake child. Bae disagreed Bijou would be tricked but had another idea. [She bought another hat/child](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11383) and [renamed the real Khaos](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11464). A ploy that [Bijou fell for.](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=12085)\n\n[***The dispute... for a the lack of a better word was a Mess***](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11850). \n\nThe matter of primary custody go to Bae's favour with visitation rights given to Shiori. Bijou would waived all her rights as parental rights to Khaos and Gonathan would step up to support the child, despite being an outsider to this family dispute, and all of the party involved, minus the Good Knight Gonathan for he is still part of Mordan's Pack and too kind, would turn and blame the innocent Tavern-owning Therapist Chef for their heated dispute.\n\n[Bae is also Mother to another child](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13027).\n\nBijou and Bae would make [amends in Shiori's shack](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13039) and admit they are all family now as Khaos played by the carpet and the second child playing by the bed. Expressing they all want everyone to be happy. Bae giving her blessing for Bijou to visit Khaos from time to time. An extend the same for Shiori. Gonathan was there as well and so was included and [would pay for child support](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13387).\n\nGonathan would pull Bae away to talk to her privately in the PP hole where Bae would explain that perhaps her memories are linked to her missing box. Conversation would then turn to Immerkind Bae explaining that she would send the letter [in front Cecilia](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13807) so she can present her flowers after Cecilia finished reading. Gonathan promised to wingman for Bae when the morrow comes.\n\nShe would also need to build a safe room for her *children* but that is a quest for another day.",

But more often than not, she played the role of a distant observer, silently watching the chaos unfold around her.\n\n[She likes to observe](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?t=17280)\n\nIn the situations where she was actually involved, she often felt more like a background prop being shuffled around than a key player—take, for example, the convoluted tale involving her old child with Bijou, which spiraled into a full-on legal dispute (see [Bae-Bijou:…](#edge:peasant-da-bae-koseki-bijou-bottom-1-bottom-2)).\n\nShe did make time to join the others for the new [Star Site: Chaos dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?t=7733) and even fought the Outlander—y’know, the actual main quest that somehow got buried under all the emotional wreckage.\n\nAt the very least, she ended the day with some quiet, meaningful moments spent with her new-slash-old romantic partner, and later penned it all down in her diary.\n\n[Relaxing with the gem](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?15814)",

            "content": "**(Archiver’s Note: This is a long read and there’s also a couple tough scenes. Reader discretion is advised.)**\n\nToday was the day Princess Bijou wanted to set things straight.\n\nShe had awoken from the bed of her beloved. It was the first night of restful sleep she had in a span of four days; she either slept on the floor of her shop or collapsed (like that one time at the end of Day 2). \n\nShe went back to her shop, where she found the story she commissioned from her dearly beloved! Hidden in a corner, [she read it out loud.](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=515)\n\nIt was only 10 pages long like she asked, but… it ended on a cliffhanger! She desperately wanted to see what would happen next. Luckily, Shiori just got on, so she was able to ask for a sequel then and there.\n\nShe also invited Shiori to go to Star Site: Chronos together, knowing her boss was absent yesterday and had yet to see it. Shiori had to get ~~dinner~~ breakfast first AND was anticipating some sort of meeting with the other Chefs in a few minutes, so they put a pin on that.\n\nSpeaking of her boss, Roa came back today after a well-deserved day off. Elizabeth, the Red Knight, came by the shop during this time and… it seems like [Roa had the hots for her?](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=3401) \n\nBijou tried to push her towards making a move, and it seems like she did—although she made it anonymous. A secret admirer sort of situation. Whatever happened after that… wasn’t Bijou’s problem at that point.\n\n----\n\nAfter her revisit to Star Site: Chronos, [she called up Peasant Bae](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=7980), asking for materials for her shop as she ran out after serving Gonathan. This was how Bijou decided to bait her into trying to get Khaos back…\n\nVeiled behind a regular business transaction, Bijou confronts the Peasant about the Stain hat on her head. She and Shiori had previously abandoned the baby back in the illusory Libestal, and now she wants it back.\n\n(*NOTE: [Biboo clarified outside of RP](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=25370) that Khaos is the stain hat that Shiori wore last chapter. The stain hat that Bijou got corrupted by went away after she got purified.*)\n\nBae strongly believed she had been taking better care of Khaos since she found it; after all, Bae did the right thing to free them from the shackles of slavery. *(How it traveled back in time with the warriors is…not explained.)* \n\n[The hat is not for sale.](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=8082)\n\nAs if her Onii-chan and her sister openly eavesdropping on this wasn’t enough, Bijou tried getting Tam’s opinion on the matter. …It was too early for the queen to deal with it. The two will just have to settle it in therapy later.\n\nThat said, they would have to set their differences aside for the time being. It was time for Bijou to investigate Star Site: Chaos.\n\n----\n\nLittle did she know that she would be asked to duel with none other than [The Outlander](#node:the-outlander) upon her return, as a test of her strength for what's to come.\n\nThey were transported to a [vaguely familiar place](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=11300) to fight. Bijou was victorious, winning on the first try. Somehow she could be reached by phone in that mysterious battlefield, but that didn't distract her from fighting.\n\nThe dialogue she had with the Princess and the Outlander after the duel had Bijou pause to think deeply for a moment. Although she was being asked about the fate of Libestal, she couldn’t just think of that when asked this one question:\n\n[“What does Libestal mean to you?”](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=11473)\n\n----\n\nBijou met with Gonathan at the Library after recovering [Fia’s](#node:fia) third memory fragment. [Gonathan soon asked for Bijou’s ear](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=11846) in regards to a serious matter.\n\nSat under a big tree far from everyone else’s buildings, he felt the need to confess about eavesdropping on the conversation she had with Bae earlier.\n\nGonathan realized how much Bijou likes Shiori. If there was anything he could do to help Bijou get the baby back, he was but one call away. (See [Bijou-Gonathan: Good Neighbors](#edge:gonathon-g-koseki-bijou-left-3-left-3).) In response, she invited Gonathan to join her therapy session with Bae.\n\nBae was waiting at the wagon, now having reclaimed her memories as Hakos Baelz (she was still a peasant at heart). She postponed her therapy session until after she revisited Star Site: Chaos. With Bijou, Gonathan, and Ina, they tried winning the hidden music disc a second time.\n\nThey all failed the first time in their respective parties; Bijou’s party ended with 53% luck. In that second attempt, with a 9-in-10 chance, they were successful! \n\nThey ran to the nearest jukebox to celebrate…to the Hot Pink One’s chagrin at first, as they went straight to *his* jukebox first.\n\n[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, PLAY DICE!](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=13505)\n\nThat was the peak of Bijou’s happiness that day. The calm before the storm, if you will. The events that would later transpire would become traumatic to innocent Princess Bijou…\n\n----\n\nAs she approached Shiori’s house, she saw Gonathan at her front door. She wanted to ask Shiori to come to couples’ therapy, but she innocently let him go inside and let the two talk things out first. She [hid inside the outhouse](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15243) to eavesdrop on them for a bit. …Apparently Shiori had cooked a meal for Gonathan?!\n\nAt some point [she felt guilty](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15366) about eavesdropping. She didn’t wanna be blinded by jealousy and rage once again. Her trust in both of them stayed true. If they felt the need to talk things out, that’s their business. She even [called Bae](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15485), out of not having nobody else to turn to.\n\nBijou decided to postpone the therapy session a little bit longer. She wanted to see Shiori anyway. Feigning ignorance, she entered Shiori’s house. Gonathan appeared to be coming back in; he was wearing a Chef’s Touque.\n\nShiori was kind enough to let her in and feed her. The first thing Bijou brought up was the child, and what Shiori’s opinion on the matter was.\n\nShiori was very frank about her feelings. [If the child is happy, she’s willing to support from afar.](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15866) The best course of action seemed to just let Bae have the child… unless Bijou objects.\n\nBijou wasn’t entirely satisfied by this answer. She was pursuing this for Shiori’s sake. Her stance did not change, but… agreed to come to the therapy session.\n\nIn essence, this was now a family therapy session.\n\n----\n\nAlone, Bijou went to Mordan’s therapy shack to begin therapy. She stated her case, only for Bae to suddenly butt in and object. Shiori and Gonathan soon followed, and the court case truly began.\n\n[Family Court](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15988)\n\nGonathan was kind of just… there though. This was mainly an affair between Bijou, Shiori, and Bae. Gonathan looked confused almost the entire time and nay spoke a word… even though he paid to be there.\n\nNonetheless, there was a lot of yelling back and forth. Poor Princess Bijou felt overwhelmed by this entire exchange and emotions got the best of her. She couldn’t even see the fact that the Stain on Bae’s head [wasn’t actually her child!](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=16677) Bae  was also the mother of another child all along...\n\nMordan closed the case as follows: [Shiori](#node\n:shiori-nyavella) can have visitation rights, but Bijou must offer child support. Bijou then brought up living space concerns, stating that the diamond-studded room in Bae’s hole was too small and thus inadequate.\n\nWhile looking for an adequate living space for the child, Mordan began to lose her composure. She [talked under her breath](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17200) towards Shiori; they had a bad relationship from day one in Past Libestal. Unfortunately, everyone heard that and were all shook by this. Even Shiori—they were still in a therapy session!\n\nThe five of them tried to reconcile—which Bijou partially helped in by agreeing to pay for the [charges](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17403) put against her by Bae. “Call it child support”, said Shiori. \n\nAll seemed to be well… but it somehow got worse. Overwhelmed in anger, Mordan ran away and left for the day. They were all out of a therapist.\n\nBijou felt the need to talk to Bae after the entire fiasco. [Things went out of hand](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17644) and they knew that. The better course of action is just to talk it out. As a family.\n\nShiori seemed to be off finding Gonathan again. Bae had let the children play in Shiori’s room for the time being. As part of their reconciliation, Bae mutually agreed to give Bijou visitation rights after all (alongside Shiori).\n\nThe two of them came back to Gonathon and Shiori, [reconciling](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17898) as a group on their own terms. Mordan was now seen in a new light. Were her services biased after all? Whatever happened to impartiality? And what of privacy, for that matter?\n\nMaybe they’ll seek different avenues of therapy the next day. That jeweler Mococo offers therapy sessions too, after all…\n\nAfter all of that, Bijou asked where she stood with Shiori regarding their relationship. They mutually agreed to let Bae have the child, and Bae allowed them to visit whenever they pleased. All was well.\n\n[…But what will come of the two of them?](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=18552)\n\n----\n\nAs if the day was over, the two of them [wrote their daily journals](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=19395) together inside the therapist shack. But… the day’s tension was not over. \n\nAs the two were about to submit their daily journals to the library, they walked into Tam and IRyS. The queen was confessing her love to IRyS. Bijou sees this all go down from a distance, not even thinking at first to go to her brother’s side.\n\nGonathan had also finished his daily journal around this time and walked in on this, only to get turned away by Shiori. No matter… Gonathon had seen enough. Shiori demanded Gonathan to sit in the therapy chair until they cleared out.\n\nShiori and Bijou returned to the inside of the library. She continued to distance herself from the matter, but… wait—IRyS is EXPECTING?! Hearing what Tam and IRyS were saying… the Princess started to spiral too.\n\n[\"Is no person in this kingdom good?!\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=20720)\n\nTo try bringing comedic relief to the situation, Bijou asks to make sure if it’s just gas she is feeling. Then again, if it was real, then maybe a [gender reveal party](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=20922) is to be called for. Shiori could easily provide for that.\n\nBijou had to speak to someone about this though. Now without a therapist, [Shiori lends both her and Gonathan her ear](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21122)—promising to be completely unbiased. Unlike that reaper/lorekeeper/tavern keeper guy…\n\nThis was mainly Gonathon’s time to speak his mind about what he felt. Bijou had also given her two cents on the matter, coming from her blood-pact relation to IRyS. She leaves Shiori and Gonathan alone after the latter leaves to go see where IRyS was.\n\n----\n\n***(content warning ahead)***\n\nBijou returned to doing her business when she noticed an [eerie, deafening silence](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21666). Only Elizabeth and Shiori were around in the Building Area. She thought of calling her brother to see what was up… [at the nick of time](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21724).\n\nThis was how Bijou found out that her brother was thinking of going away…... forever. She didn’t have the entire context for why—all she knew was that she had been berated. She rushed as fast as she could to go save her.\n\nBased on what he said his location was, her instincts led her to the Antigonian Aerie. She loved her Onii-chan so much… so much that she would follow wherever he went. Even if it meant *diving off a cliff right next to him.*\n\n[The Goddess is descending.](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21847)\n\nGonathon and Tam jumped off with them. While they survived the fall, IRyS and Bijou both perished…\n\n…*”in Minecraft.”* \n\nThe blood-pact brothers respawned on the warp point, seemingly given a second chance.\n\nIRyS’ pain subsided briefly, but it came back. Is the baby… still there? IRyS believes so; she’s a goddess, after all. But could the baby be an eldritch being, a demi-god, or both? Or is it just food after all? *Only time will tell.* They still plan to surprise her consort (Ina) with the news the next day.\n\n----\n\nAfter this traumatic experience, she [meets with Shiori again](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=22527) to talk about the circumstances for the gender reveal party. After the absolute chaos that ensued that day, they sat on the front porch of the house next to the wagon. Elizabeth was there as well. It’s at this moment when Princess Bijou, ever innocent, asked the Red Knight…\n\n[\"Do you think there are truly good people in this world?\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=22748)\n\nThey also spent some time gossiping about the lore of the kingdom so far before heading out. Bijou listened to Elizabeth’s answer to her question in earnest, but… she wasn’t convinced.\n\nShe already turned in her journal; her thoughts have not changed. She needs some time to think about it. To see if her words were true. Her world view had turned more cynical after today.\n\nShe does admit, at least, that she needed that talk with the Red Knight. She needed that moment looking up in the sky, and to the buildings in front of them. It eased her mind at least a little.\n\nDespite her rock-hard appearance, today proved our Princess Bijou had a soft, emotional core prone to crumbling in the face of drama. She wonders if she could handle existing in this universe.\n\n*“We will have to see what tomorrow brings.”*\n\nShe went to bed with her dearly beloved that night.",

            "content": "**What Does It Mean to be a Knight?**\n\nThe previous day’s events had left Gonathon G. a broken and deeply troubled knight. However, as the sun rose on a new day, Gonathon was resolute in her desire to seek redemption and improve.\n \nFirst, Gonathon paid a visit to her therapist Mordan Ramsey, whom she had desperately petitioned for aid the night before (see [Calli-Gonathon: Confidently Confidential](#edge:mori-calliope-gonathon-g-bottom-1-bottom-3)). Beginning their session in earnest, Mordan implored the knight to fight for her own beliefs and code, rather than blindly following the wishes of others. She further told a [love story](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=964) between a maiden and knight, one that was deeply familiar to Gonathon (and was in fact one of her and her Pearl.)\n\n[You are the master of your own fate](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=1076)\n\nGonathon’s travels that day would see her lending aid to many people, including those she had every right to see as rivals or foes. For Princess Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Good Neighbors](#edge:gonathon-g-koseki-bijou-left-3-left-3)), the one who was now betrothed to her former love Shiori, the humble knight apologized for using Shiori to fill the hole in her heart left by her Pearl, and the two promised to always help one another. And for Bae the Peasant (see [Bae-Gonathon: A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed](#edge:peasant-da-bae-gonathon-g-left-3-right-3)), who Gonathon had feared was corrupted and threatening the land, Gonathon gave her the courage to confess to Immerkind, seeking to make right the error she had committed in shackling Immerkind’s heart to the Princess. Even the Hot Pink One, who perhaps most of all was undeserving of any generosity, the humble knight swore to serve as a loyal guard dog, although this would prove to be a troublesome arrangement in due time. \n\nSoon after, Gonathon joined up with the Wolf Pack to tackle the next dungeon. Here Gonathon had a heart-to-heart with Shakira (see [Gonathon-Kiara: Swords to Plowshares](#edge:gonathon-g-takanashi-kiara-left-2-bottom-2)) that saw the wily phoenix consoling Gonathon on her personal strife and arranging for Mordan to groom the scruffy knight. Free of fleas and full of determination, Gonathon fought alongside the Pack in Star Site: Chaos, besting its games of chance and ferocious Stain King. Following a revelation of Bae’s true identity, Gonathon found herself face to face with an all too familiar person: the Outlander. \n\n[Take this! Revelation!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=7292)\n\nAn intense duel saw Gonathon emerge victorious once more, and a flood of memories return. When asked why she fought and what Libestal meant to her, Gonathon [responded resoundingly](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=7383): from now on, she would not fight simply because she was told or because of blind duty, but because it was what she believed in. For her, Libestal meant kindness, compassion, and above all always fighting for what you believed in. \n\n[My own code, my own honor! The way of a knight!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=7585)\n\nFollowing this, Gonathon met with the aloof, but deeply familiar Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame (see [Elizabeth-Gonathon: Honor and Justice](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-gonathon-g-bottom-1-top-1)). As a fellow knight, Liz had become deeply concerned with Gonathon’s dealings with Shiori. She too asked Gonathon what she was fighting for, and after being asked what she thought of Gonathon, the scarlet knight described the [deep kinship](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10855) she felt for Gonathon, Immerkind, and Roa. The two agreed they shared a special bond, and resolved to fight for an even higher cause than mere honor or love: that of Justice. Filled with resolve, Gonathon went forth to confront her greatest challenge of the day: reconciling with Shiori Nyavella. \n\n[The Knights heed the call for Justice](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10989)\n\nThe [reunion of the diamond and black pearl](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11506) proved bittersweet. Shiori lamented Gonathon’s flaws, both past and present. Yet despite all Gonathon had done wrong, Shiori assured the knight that while she was indeed a fool, she had a good heart. It was this good heart that was on display as, during an intense couple’s therapy session and child custody battle between Bae and Shiori and Bijou, Gonathon would assist in smoothing out the difficulties they shared, even promising to provide monetary support to the child. The new family, dubbed State Farm, parted on happy terms and, following a final heart to heart with Mordan in which she provided career advice to her former therapist, Gonathon prepared to turn in for the night. \n\n[A happy ending…for now](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=14038)\n\nBut her most grueling trial was yet to come, for yet another figure needed Gonathon’s aid: her beloved queen, Tam Gandr (see [Gonathon-Kronii: The Sham Queen’s Sacrifice](#edge:tam-gandr-gonathon-g-right-2-bottom-1)). Tam had become enslaved by the deviant HPO, and had fallen into a pit of despair not unlike that which Gonathon had experienced the previous day. [Enraged](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15494) that her queen would be treated this way, Gonathon implored Tam to stand up for herself and demand the respect she was owed as a monarch. The queen was moved to tears, thanking Gonathon for always standing with her, even at her lowest. Sadly, the HPO arrived before Tam could be properly steeled, and Gonathon was forced to flee in tears as Tam fell to the foul goddess’s mercy. \n\n[The Queen’s Most Loyal, Treasured Knight](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15915)\n\nUnwilling to abandon her queen and treasured friend, Gonathon charged back into the fray, only to find that Tam had heeded her advice and laid low the degenerate pink creature. After foiling an attempt by HPO to escape her responsibility, Gonathon and Tam had a [bewildering heart to heart](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=18669) in which the knight convinced the queen to seek a more equal role in the relationship…and expanded cat kissing rights. Thus Gonathon’s first steps to redemption came to an end, and while the knight still has much work to do, she resolved to stay optimistic and hold her head high. \n\n[Writing the daily journal](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16249)",

During this time, she stumbled across her lover, Tammy, who was whimpering after losing a hefty sum to the store gacharm. And right after, she ran into the store’s owner and the two had their \"usual exchange.\" These two back-to-back encounters laid the groundwork for yet another drama in the kingdom, with the pink woman somehow ending up thinking she might be pregnant (see [IRyS-Kronii: Abdomen Pain](#edge:hot-pink-one-tam-gandr-right-2-left-2)).\n\nShe then appointed Gonathon as her loyal dog, after witnessing just how loyal—and frankly, how doglike—he was (see [IRyS-Gonathon: No Goddesses or Queens, only Grems](#edge:hot-pink-one-gonathon-g-bottom-1-top-3)).\n\nAnd once all the chaos had passed, she ended her day [journaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=17165s) about it all.",

The plot thickened when Roa, Tam, and the hot pink lady (yes, the very same one Tam also had lingering feelings for—and who just so happens to be Roa’s master, as Roa was her pet) decided to team up for the day’s dungeon again in search of treasure.\n\nIt went about as well as you’d expect: chaotic, emotionally confusing, and leaving a trail of drama in its wake (see [Roa-Kronii:…](#edge:tam-gandr-roa-pandora-top-1-top-2) and [Kronii-IRyS: Gassed Up](#edge:hot-pink-one-tam-gandr-right-2-left-2)).\n\nAt the end of the day, Tammy wrapped it all up the best way she knew how—writing in her journal after casually inflicting mental damage on everyone involved.

Memories of the past too painful to remember - a feeling of warmth now left terribly cold.\n\n\"Oh! I want this one, my good fellow!\"\n\nWarm hands sudden, but oh so gentle, took her from the pile to be placed on a head with red, soft hair. Though scared at first, Khaos soon found herself carried almost everywhere; from the peaceful fields of Libestals to the admittedly terrifying Dungeons, Khaos was never alone. Not anymore.\n\nIt was frightening at first, to suddenly be at the hands, well, head, of a stranger. But that feeling was quick to leave. The red-head, Peasant The Bae, would looked at Khaos warmly, as if she was more than just a simple mistaken hat.\n\nAs if she was a child deserved to be treasured. \n\nUnwittingly, Khaos overheard much of Bae's randomly muttering of her own Mother. One who would speak of lessons when Bae was younger, to guide the young rat in the wise ways of peasantry. Khaos would listen silently and wondered, is this what's it like to have a 'Mother'?\n\n\nSo, child and Mother would spend their days in Libestal; child watching, learning, Mother mine and craft, and Mother ensuring the child does not fall from her head by accident while going up the waterfall. \n\nOf course, when there are peaceful days, there too must be days of hardship, Khaos remembered Mother said once.\n\nIt came in the form of shiny Princess called Bijou. Khaos would note warily that the Princess would stare at her at times, intensely as if she memories will come back to her if Bijou stared at Khaos long enough. Khaos in turn would wonder why the princess looked oddly familiar.\n\nEventually, the past unveiled itself:\n\nBijou would confront Bae about Khaos, about her regrets, about her foolishness, and the intent to make things right - Khaos's other mother, at least.\n\nKhaos was too young to remember the past but all she wanted was the present. Her Mother.\n\nIt only brought a large sense of relief when Mother refused to part with her. That Mother viewed Khaos as child of her own.\n\nIt was terrifying to see Mother so angry against everyone and Khaos was gladd to see that everyone reconciled in the end. Thought she's a little bit wary of Princess-Mother, it seems she doesn't dislike Khaos. \n\nNow, Khaos waits for a new room just for her and her new little sibling too! ",

Asking Tammy to wear a [maid outfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=9123s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH ) and say the cringiest lines. Flirting openly with her wedded partner while treating Tammy like a convenient side quest. \n\nBut Tammy was no better, she was two timing, with another pink one.\n\nSo disaster was bound to strike for these two to be together.\n\nOut if nowhere, the pink one, casually dropped the bomb that she was pregnant—with someone else’s child. Yes, pregnant. That little detail.\n\n[Pregante](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=14395s)\n\nThe reveal was so shocking it rendered Tammy mute. But really—why? What exactly was Pinky trying to accomplish here? Make Tammy jealous? Stir some kind of reaction? If so, it failed spectacularly. Tammy wasn’t impressed. In fact, she was straight-up repulsed.\n\nAnd as if embarrassed by her own failed bit, Pinky spiraled. Dramatically. Talking about committing sudoku levels of melodrama. \n\n[Krilling thyself](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=15217s)\n\nShe even found a cliff to jump off. Her brother tried to stop her… and ended up jumping too. Don’t worry—they came back immediately. Because dying isn’t an option here. But the stomach pains? Gone. So was it a miscarriage… or just gas? Let’s go with gas.\n\n[Hope descends with gas](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=15503s)\n\nHonestly, what even was this storyline supposed to be?",

            "content": "Upon awaking for a new day, the blissfully unaware Mordan Ramsey was created by the aftermath of the firestorm of tragedy that had befallen Libestal, with her primary duty now to consoling a distraught Gonathon who had sent her a flurry of letters begging for aid the night before. \n\nPulling Gonathon into her therapy room, Mordan was immediately met by an apology from Gonathon who felt guilty for the disastrous blind date the night before, and further asked why Mordan even liked her in the first place. The sagely Mordan then began to tell a love story between a kindhearted knight and a maiden that seemed [eerily familiar](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=974), but Gonathon continued to insist she was not worthy of love and loyal to her queen. Mordan insisted that blind loyalty was “ick” and that Gonathon needed above all else to make decisions for her own sake. Gifting Gonathon a beautiful mural of herself (which Gonathon sneakily returned the favor by placing her own mural in Mordan’s home) the two parted for the time being. \n\nLater, the wolf pack once again assembled to delve into a dungeon. It was here that the wily Shakira (see [Gonathon-Kiara: Swords to Plowshares](#edge:gonathon-g-takanashi-kiara-left-2-bottom-2)) once again brought the therapist and knight together by convincing Mordan to [groom](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=5062) the scruffy knight of the flees afflicting her. The pack then descended into the dungeon, and although difficult they easily proved victorious. Having overcome two trials with Gonathon, one of the mind and another of the realm, the two seemingly said farewell for the day.\n\n[What exactly is the Wolf Pack?](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=4946)\n\nAlas for poor Mordan, this trials would pale in comparison to what would come next, however the hardship would come not from the knight, but from the quarrelling Peasant Bae and Princess Bijou (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:peasant-da-bae-koseki-bijou-bottom-1-bottom-2)) who were engaged in a custody battle for Khaos. The lengthy, grueling couples therapy that followed saw Gonathon serving as a voice of reason, but sadly the other three left in disgust following an outburst by Mordan calling out what she saw as their prejudices. \n\n[God she is so ****ing crazy](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=13255)\n\nA crestfallen Mordan vowed to give up therapy forever, but Gonathon insisted her skills had proven invaluable to bringing the knight back from the brink of despair. Trading places with Mordan, Gonathon now sat in the therapist’s chair. She repeated a [line of advice](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=13671) she had given Bijou days before: to not allow the misery of customer service take the twinkle out of her eye. The humble knight implored Mordan to take up fortune telling instead, as not only could she help people, but the blame would be solely on the gods. Thoroughly amused, Mordan replied she would consider it, and the two wolves ended their day on a much happier note than before. \n\n[You have a heart of gold, don’t let them take it from you](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=13585)",

Somehow though a spark of interest remained for the bumbling knight, and Shiori was keen to not allow sleeping wolves to lie. \n\nGonathon began the day with the witch on her mind, but upon encountering her before the dungeon, Shiori seemed to avoid the knight, a fact which Gonathon was understanding of. It was to Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Good Neighbors](#edge:gonathon-g-koseki-bijou-left-3-left-3)) that the subject of the witch would come to the spotlight, with Gonathon expressing her regret for using Shiori to fill the hole in her heart left by the loss of her Pearl. The witch and the knight would not stay apart for long though, and Gonathon soon found herself once again waiting outside Shiori’s door. \n\n[My Fumbling Knight](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11508)\n\nOverhearing a phone conversation between Shiori and Liz, Shiori held nothing back in expressing her disgust for Gonathon’s actions. This did not dent the knight’s resolve and she quickly confronted Shiori directly. The witch continued to [hold nothing back](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12262), referring to Gonathon as a fumbling knight and disparaging her for requiring so much support to commit to her actions in the past. Chief of all, Shiori presented a question that Gonathon had herself deeply considered: that Gonathon was simply treating her as a salve for her wounded heart, and that as a [Black Pearl](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12317), she was simply an imitation of the real thing. \n\nDespite all that Gonathon had done, and despite admitting she was still a fool, Shiori could not deny her feeling that the knight deep down was a [good person](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12416). Gonathon for her part apologized to the witch and expressed regret for the way she had treated her.\nHowever, Gonathon’s role in Shiori’s story was far from over. Recruited by Bijou as a form of “moral support”, Gonathon played witness to the intense custody battle between Peasant the Bae and Shiori and Bijou. Wanting to play her own part in the child’s upbringing, Gonathon vowed to provide funds for child support, and in turn joined the newly formed State Farm family. \n\n[We’re good neighbors!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=14029)\n\nFrom there, Shiori would attempt to dissuade Gonathon from being too brash about assisting Tam Gandr, although her words were unable to restrain the loyal knight from leaping to her queen’s defense. As the witch and knight parted for the final time that day, it was abundantly clear that Shiori was far from done with the humble knight, and in some ways may just be getting started in pulling on her strings.

For the queen had found herself not only destitute following several poor spending choices, but had even ruined her relationships with HPO and Roa. Stripped of her dignity and [blackmailed](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15489) by those she once loved, it was now her turn to seek the aid of the knight who the previous day she had wrenched from her own abyss. \n\nInitially seeking therapy from Mordan, upon learning of her retirement Tam begged Gonathon to help her. Spilling her guts about the horrific situation she found herself in, not even the revelation that Gonathon had somehow ended up in HPO’s service herself (see [Gonathon-Irys: No Goddesses or Queens, only Grems](#edge:hot-pink-one-gonathon-g-bottom-1-top-3)) could dissuade Tam from seeing the knight as her last hope. And the queen’s faith was well placed, for upon hearing of Tam’s enslavement to HPO, Gonathon flew into a rage and implored the queen to fight for her dignity and status as a monarch. \n\n[It’s over…it’s so over](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15613)\n\nGonathon mused over their options, including taking HPO to court, while a shellshocked Tam thanked Gonathon for her [purity and unbreakable loyalty](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15872). Alas, nothing could be done at the moment for the vile goddess had discovered Kronii and commenced ravaging her in front of the humble knight. Despite wishing to remain by her queen’s side, Tam’s tearful plea to not witness her humiliation forced Gonathon to retreat, but not before promising to return. Writhing with frustration over the queen’s plight, Gonathon was briefly consoled by Shiori and Bijou, but their words imploring the knight to not get involved only served to harden the knight’s resolve: she had to save her queen!\n\n[I don’t want you to see me like this…](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16167)\n\nRushing to her queen’s side once more, Gonathon was shocked to find that Tam Gandr had turned the tables on the degenerate pink Nephilim, who was now groveling at Tam’s feet. Joining forces with Tam once more, the two of them along with Bijou talked HPO out of [jumping to her demise](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17973) (although this did still occur, with Tam and Gonathon surviving the fall). Gonathon had a truly perplexing heart to heart with Tam and urged her to stand up for herself and earn more respect, along with cat kissing rights. Flabbergasted, but still thankful for her knight’s steadfast loyalty, Tam praised Gonathon for all she had done. Witnessing one final exchange between HPO and the queen in which Tam stated that Gonathon was all she needed, Gonathon departed, content of the good deeds she had done for her beloved queen.\n\n[I guess we’re kissing cats now?](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=18803)",

At this point the goddess simply demanded tribute and, busy with other tasks, Gonathon departed for the dungeon.\n\nAfter assisting State Farm with couple’s therapy (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:peasant-da-bae-koseki-bijou-bottom-1-bottom-2)), Gonathon once again encountered HPO as she was desperately seeking therapy following a series of unfortunate events with Tam Gandr (see [Irys-Kronii: Nice Boat](#edge:hot-pink-one-tam-gandr-right-2-left-2)). Completely oblivious to the maelstrom of controversy that had erupted between the queen and the goddess, Gonathon offered to assist HPO despite being in opposing factions. For even if they could not be wolves, Gonathon would still serve as her [guard dog](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=14697). However the humble knight soon learned that her intended target would be none other than her beloved queen. \n\n[You did what?!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15178)\n\nTam quickly revealed to Gonathon the extent of HPO’s depravity (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Sham Queen Sacrifice](#edge:tam-gandr-gonathon-g-right-2-bottom-1)). Enraged over the treatment of her queen, Gonathon pleaded with Tam to not allow HPO to demean her in such a manner. Alas, Tam was seemingly powerless to oppose HPO, and upon HPO’s return and renewed degeneracy towards the queen, Gonathon was forced to make a tactical retreat at [Tam’s behest](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16162). \n\nUnwilling to simply abandon her queen to the deviant goddess, Gonathon rushed back in to assist Tam. It was there that Gonathon witnessed an incredible scene: Tam taking her words to heart and [bringing HPO to heel](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17471). HPO, shedding any semblance of being a respectable goddess, fled with her tail between her legs before threatening to jump to her demise. It was through the combined efforts of Gonathon, Tam, and Bijou that HPO was eventually talked down. \n\n[Hope attempts to descend](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17972) \n\nFollowing a bewildering, but heartfelt conversation with Gonathon, Tam was able to reconcile with HPO and react a mutual understanding that would see her honor restored and her cat kissing privileges upgraded. While HPO was quick to demean Gonathon, the queen hastily [defended](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=19836) the humble knight, who was watching in secret. And thus the most contrived filler arc came to a close.",

Bijou gave Gonathon some advice of her own, that perhaps the knight had simply not experienced love yet and encouraged her to not give up in seeking her own happiness. \n\n[A Princess's Advice to a Humble Knight](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=8282)\n\nThis exchange touched Bijou so much that she insisted that Gonathon be present as [moral support](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11861) for the no holds barred custody battle with Bae the Peasant over the child Khaos, and following the dispute ending amicably, inducted Gonathon into her new extended family, dubbed State Farm, as they were all good neighbors to one another.\n\nWhile Bijou would ultimately take the side of HPO against Tam Gandr, this would not cripple the bond between princess and knight. Rather, Gonathon had simply cemented another friendship and righted another wrong she had inflicted on others the day prior. \n\n[Little Princess...Do not Eat the Yellow Snow](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11794)\n",

And Bijou doing math for 30 minutes for Bae.\n\nBut this friendship would be put to the test when Bae bought what seemed like a hat. A hat that Bijou couldn't help but eye with familiarity. \n\nBijou was worried as memories of the past slowly returned to her. Something had happened, a terrible fate had befallen her and would have consumed her if not for others. A fate that Bijou feared the Peasant might experience herself.\n\nThen, Bijou's memories wholly returned.\n\nThe hat on Bae's head wasn't an evil artefact! It was her child! Her child with her beloved Shiori Nyavella. \n\nAnd so, Bijou would plead to Bae for her child. To have Khaos back. For Shiori's sake. \n\nBut rather than sympathy, Bae was appalled by Bijou's story. A child abandoned by both parents should be loved and looked after by someone who truly cared!\n\nThis dispute eventually led them to receive counselling form Mordan Ramsey in order to decide custody - then, visitation. \n\nIt was a complicated matter fuelled by heated feelings from all sides that ultimately led to their therapist leaving and calling it a day and Bae and Bijou talking in Shiori's humble home.\n\nAs they watch Khaos and the second unnamed child Bae has adopted play together, the two make amends. They agreed that they both let their emotions overwhelmed them and that therapy was a waste of money and time.\n\nBae, who still had primary custody by the agreement of all parties involved, Bijou included, gave her blessing for Bijou to visit Khaos.",

Determined to uphold their knightly honor and do what was right for their friends and the people, the two promised to uphold their vow as [the Knights of Justice](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10950), and fight together for what they believed in. Sharing a bro hug, the two parted ways, their determination to fight for their code and beliefs burning brighter than ever before.\n\n[For Justice!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11090)\n\nWhile this was the end of Gonathon’s interactions with Liz for the day, it was not the end of the advice she would receive. For a [strange, floating cape](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11687) would appear before Gonathon and lecture the humble knight on whether she was making the right choices. This exchange further hardened Gonathon’s resolve, and with her knightly code firmly engraved on her heart once more, she set out to set things to right. ",

As Lady Elizabeth's laugh softly rang in Roa's ears.\n\nOr is it her kindness that attracts Roa to her?\n\nAfter the warm greeting, Roa watched the Red Knight approach The Gacharms shop, inquiring about the charms they sell and what would they advise for her to us. There's a sense of pride Roa felt as she watched Bijou handles the deal.\n\nThe Knight would only grow stronger from their charms. Roa admired Elizabeth's strength since she could dream to be as strong as her.\n\nElizabeth would humbly wave Roa's compliment, pointing that Roa's brains was quite helpful in the dungeon the other day.\n\nPleased by the compliment, Roa would watch the humble Knight leave. \n\nBut it seems Elizabeth is popular;  Roa watched her and Nerissa in the distance, her god-eyes sparking as she spied the two converse. Jealousy sparked when Bijou mentioned Roa shouldn't leave the two alone. Though Elizabeth seemed to avoid looking at Nerissa, it doesn't change the way Nerissa searches for Elizabeth.\n\nRoa might be a pretty kitty, but she is a persistant panther too, soon buying gifts and leaving them in Elizabeth's room.\n\nOnly time will tell if she can make The Red Knight hers.",
