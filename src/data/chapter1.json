      "dayRecap": "## Day 1: The Chains of Employment\nThe kingdom of Libestal has returned—but something is… off. Our heroes have traveled back in time?! As if the whole “the King was evil and the old kingdom was a fabricated illusion” twist wasn’t enough, now we’ve got *time travel* thrown into the mix. But alright, maybe it’s not so bad, they just need t—oh, they’ve also lost their memories. Again???\n\nForget the bonds, the connections, the whole history they’d built up—our heroes now begin anew. A new kingdom, new lives, even new identities. But one thing hasn’t changed: their mission to recover their shattered memories and, somehow, save the world—no, the *universe*—from calamity. The King, now known as the Outsider, still seeks its end.\n\nThe (new? old?) kingdom of Libestal also brings new systems for the heroes to learn. Guilds are gone, replaced by *Jobs*, and each hero is free to choose the path they wish to walk:\n\n* **The Smith:** Crafts upgrade stones used to enhance Revelation Weapons.\n* **The Jeweler:** Crafts charms that boost health and defense.\n* **The Chef:** Cooks meals that grant adventuring buffs.\n* **The Supplier:** Enchants tools, improving resource gathering.\n\n![The job selection area](/images-opt/jobs.webp)\n\nThe kingdom itself has undergone a makeover too. With a strong wooden motif, it carries a distinctly medieval vibe. No tyrannical King this time—replacing him is Princess Iphania, the current ruler. Alongside her is a mysterious talking cat named Fia, who manages a place known as the *Library*.\n\nThe Library holds the memories of everything, and it's now tended by lorekeepers Calli and Kiara, who work with Fia to archive the new stories our heroes will forge. At the end of each day, everyone is expected to write a diary entry of their journey and submit it to the Library.\n\n![The Library with Fia](/images-opt/library.webp)\n\nHow will any of this help save the universe? Who knows. But it's only Day 1—the start of a new adventure, a chance to forge new bonds and rediscover old ones. Forget world-saving for now. First, our heroes need to get a grip on their new lives and roles… because before anything else, they need to *pay the bills*.\n\n[Monster - ENigmatic Recollection Chapter 2 Theme Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUrITFpI85A&ab_channel=hololiveEnglish)",

            "content": "The fluffy one’s beginning mirrored that of all the others—she was given the rundown of her situation, her mission, and the state she was in: missing a piece of her memories (see [Fia](#node:fia) and [Princess Iphania](#node:iphania)). She was understandably confused, but, as always, she faced her new reality with quiet resolve. Just like in her past journey, she accepted her role and duties without hesitation.\n\nWhen asked to choose an occupation, Fuwawa became a chef. Her reason was simple and heartfelt: she wanted to bring people together through food, to create joyful moments with her cooking—a touching motive that fit her perfectly.\n\n[Fluffy food for everyone](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/-zBlbI-EuCw?si=nzN8c0Pw0-r-m8IK&t=1696)\n\nAnd so her new adventure began. Thanks to the familiarity of the kingdom’s mechanics from her previous life, the fluffy one had a much easier time settling into this strange, yet oddly familiar world. Along the way, she encountered old acquaintances—or perhaps new ones? With her memories fragmented, she couldn’t be sure. She remembered her beloved bread lady, [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/-zBlbI-EuCw?si=wV_c4zN2N9MCFymM&t=5394), but drew a blank on the striking blue maiden before her. So she gave her a name of her own:\n\n[Miss Mustard](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zBlbI-EuCw&t=3399s\n)\n\nThen came the cooking. She was a chef, after all. From soups to potato salads, Fuwawa happily prepared meal after meal. It quickly became clear she had made the right decision—cooking was easy, fun, and most importantly, fulfilling.\n\nShe spent time exploring the kingdom, inspecting the [kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zBlbI-EuCw&t=8953s\n) she would come to know well, and even visited the gallery where she stumbled upon a nostalgic painting of herself from a past she could still recall.\n\n[The chickens...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/-zBlbI-EuCw?si=EsVMxO7nW5FLNBdj&t=9049)\n\nAs the day came to a close, the doggo continued doing what she loved. She even attempted to bake a cake—though that endeavor didn’t go quite as planned, and she ultimately gave up. Still, it was a sweet and fluffy end to a sweet and fluffy start.",

She didn’t question it at all. Sure, she had trouble remembering people who were once close to her, like [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv6DAiZLbUk&t=823s), and others she was only vaguely familiar with, like [Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=KUz2qVX6vM0F-4ff&t=2737)—but beyond that, she was remarkably unbothered.\n\nMaybe, in some strange way, it was a blessing. A clean slate. A sweet release from the trail of crimes she’d left behind in her last adventure. Wrongfully suing a local business, corrupting the land, singlehandedly wiping out all of Fuwawa’s chickens in one fell swoop—this new journey was her chance at redemption.\n\nShe chose to be a jeweler this time. Why? Simple. Shiny things. Shiny things meant money. And Mococo loves money—we all know this. So the choice made perfect sense.\n\n[Me like shiny](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=_C3pZF1YEMxXEZ0S&t=1825)\n\nAnd so the fuzzy one’s journey began. Like everyone else, she had to learn the ropes of this new world. Of course, she made the most of her amnesia along the way—using it as a convenient excuse to mess with others for her own [amusement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv6DAiZLbUk&t=3798s). She dove straight into mining, digging up shiny gems and jewels, the sparkle of which lit up her eyes with [dollar signs](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=rNUGrnLRv6cy2cIy&t=4350). Her love for money hadn’t changed one bit, and she made that clear—yes, even if it involved a little [violence](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=X8jas4hawvrGxh2Y&t=6315).\n\nNot much else happened—it was only Day 1, after all. And honestly? That was probably for the best. After how chaotic things got for Mococo last time, she could use a bit of peace. Time to refresh her mind, perhaps become a kinder, gentler soul. Sure, she was still a little obsessed with cash, but who isn’t? At the very least, she didn’t have to worry about lottery tickets anymore. She could live her life, make her own choices, and—oh no, Mococo, no! She found the gambling machine!\n\n[Here we go again](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=xxcTjEyCBICYhYy1&t=9886)",

            "content": "Right as she was regaining her composure after a long slumber—ever since the battle against the corrupted King—Elizabeth suddenly found herself thrown into a place that somewhat resembled a library, where a cat named Fia greeted her and explained the current situation.\n\nThere was a lot to take in, but one detail stood out to Elizabeth more than anything else: she had been brought back in time, to an earlier state of Libestal. Her memories were fractured, and she was told she would need to recover them beyond the kingdom’s walls.\n\nElizabeth found this peculiar. She could still recall everything—her battles, her comrades, the life she once lived. But not everyone could say the same. When she met Mococo again, the latter didn’t even [recognize her](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=7Td3cbu0PPDJkx27&t=606).\n\nAfter some discussion about the library's mechanics with Kiara and Calli, Elizabeth eventually met with the Princess, who further clarified the current state of things.\n\nHaving had enough of the info dump, Elizabeth’s new journey began. Like everyone else, she needed to learn the ropes of this unfamiliar kingdom. A lot had changed: the guilds were no more, her Jade Sword master was nowhere to be found, and her former guildmates didn’t even remember her clearly. Her status as a knight who once protected the kingdom no longer held any meaning. Instead, she was told she had to… get a job.\n\n[Elizabeth \"Smith\" Bloodflame](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=NAyI0H-VdaVYmt1i&t=1901)\n\nFrom a noble knight to working minimum wage—what a downgrade. Still, Elizabeth was dutiful, and she took on the challenge. After some thought, she chose to become a smith, even crafting a quirky title for herself to match the role.\n\nBut of course, her journey was anything but smooth. Just moments after signing up for her job, the red knight—turned smith—ran into a very familiar face she absolutely did *not* want to see: Tam Gandr. A big meany. Though this time, something felt… different.\n\n[Hmm, she's not mean](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=cub9RWxGvm1oH9sK&t=2105)\n\nTam didn’t seem to remember who Elizabeth was, which strangely delighted the red maiden. The obnoxious, self-proclaimed queen was no more. But fate wasn’t so kind, for there was another blue maiden Elizabeth would've rather remained forgotten (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: She’s jesting, right?](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\nEven Elizabeth’s ex-daughter, Koseki Bijou, had no recollection of her. And with that, Elizabeth slowly realized—maybe this wasn’t a joke. Maybe she really *was* one of the few who had retained her memories. Was she sad? Was she shocked? Not really. She just felt… tired. Being thrown back in time, forced to adapt to a new life on the spot, and now the people she once held close couldn’t even remember her? Mentally, it was draining.\n\nStill, she pressed on. Maybe by focusing on her tasks, she could push those feelings aside. That plan didn’t exactly pan out either. Elizabeth was terrible with directions—[*very* terrible](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=y_o1ps5Fsgg5Gp0T&t=2561). While others zipped through their new jobs, she was constantly lost, repeatedly [struggling](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=k7qXNc2nNN22aSHQ&t=3331) to figure out where to go next, to the point she broke character and yelled out in sheer indignation.\n\n[*I miss my horse...*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=PnLljHdIk11Y8jBm&t=3454)\n\nEventually, after taking thousands of misdirected steps, she started to figure things out. Things began to look up. She chatted with [others](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=ECQ3WNgCsEOouRSU&t=4018), cracked some [terrible jokes](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=HRKqbzfBMQze3nLm&t=4666), and discovered that her sword could [shoot fire](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=rj1mAKCPPbUAYG2p&t=4782). She even managed to sneak up on Ina to prank her.\n\n[Potato Fairy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=R8Vy2HffirjAtLMt&t=6674)\n\nAs a smith, her role was to craft and upgrade weapons—both for herself and for others. But Elizabeth, wielder of a massive claymore, was more of a swinger than a maker. The whole smithing thing [confused](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=sigydwBMx8Bvvkd-&t=7247) her, and in the end, she gave up on the job—at least for now.\n\nInstead, she chose to build herself a [humble home](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=HlRR5c81lqUhhU2P&t=10915). She painted it green, a nod to her days as a Jade Sword member—something small to bring her comfort in a world where most of her friends had forgotten her. And so, her new adventure began, a lonely but determined march through the mystery that is Libestal.",

A fierce battle of epic proportions? \n\nThe mystery didn't last long as a [voice](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=471) reminds her.\n\nShe told Kiara of The Outsider who tricked everyone into freeing him. How his hate would consume millions of other worlds if not stopped. Thankfully, there is a way.\n\nKiara soon found herself in a strange Library, one caught between worlds and of time and space. A mysterious librarian brought her, and others, here. [Fia](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=753) explained who The Outsider is, how the Libestal they knew was but a Mirage, and the key to The Outsider's defeat. Unfortunately, the latter is unknown as Fia's memories are also lost. In order to save the world, Kiara must bravely venture back to Ancient Libestal and find everyone's memories.\n\nWith that in mind, Kiara and Mori Calliope (Also known as Morden Ramsay) were designated as the official Lorekeepers of The Library and relayed their mission to their fellow heroes. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, Kiara spoke of keeping a journal daily and to record the events so nothing goes amiss.\n\nWith hope in their hearts, they all set forth towards their adventures soon meeting the last Royal of Libestal, [Princess Iphania](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=1374). The Princess told a tale of how Ruination has destroyed her kingdom and family, how a Book of Prophecies foretold the end of everything in 7 days. Though the brave Princess does not know whether or not Kiara's mission would align with her own, she allows the heroes to stay in the kingdom to prepare.\n\n[For a hammer](#embed:https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=1876)\n\nDespite her overqualifications to be a chef, Kiara decided that being a smithy would benefit her in the long run. With her prowess with her sword, being a smithy will only lead to this beautiful Knight in becoming stronger.\n\nAfter slight difficulty in reading the map, the effects of time travelling lingered, Kiara eventually made her way and soon heard word of Stains roaming the kingdom and soon left to vanquish them. On the way look for the quest, Kiara found Elizabeth and is relieved to see that she too recalled their previous adventure.\n\n[Lost in only directions](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=2908) but never in heart Kiara eventually made her way to the Remnants and before she could procure the materials essential to smithy jobs, must first take care of the Stains. Hard fought, almost defeated but by the timely appearance of others, they secured a safe victory.\n\nAlong the way, Kiara met many of her companions. Though perplexed by the youths of today who would rather speak through the floors, the concept of 'dawg's - Kiara made wonderful connections, such as forming a kindred spirit with fellow orange smithy Gonathan and finding a possible cousin with Cecilia Immerkind due to the common language they speak and an appreciation for kindness.\n\nFocusing on the quests beforehand to prepare for the coming days, Kiara gained more experience as a smithy and began trading her goods with others free of charge, for her Noble Spirit as a Knight shines ever bright. Not everyone is in agreement with Kiara's ideals as Rao Pandora and her employees, the former Princess Bijou and Mococo, enforces the [Capitalistic ideals](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=9621) even possibly persuading Ina. Against all odds, and perhaps due to Kiara's kind nature, she may have convinced Bijou that fairer trades could be made - not just ones by gold.\n\nSoon, Elizabeth calls Kiara to the building area, a generous place that our heroes are free to use as they see fit, and shows her the beginnings of their shop. Kiara marvelled at the craftsmanship Elizabeth showed but is appalled that the other knight was too humble, giving herself only the sparsest of places to rest and insisted they share the upper floor.\n\nA knight and hero's work is far from over as the deadline looms over their heads. Tired, Kiara writes down on her journals before departing to rest, pondering on what the next day could bring.",

Together with Tammy, Ina, and Gonathan with a G, the group explored The Library and found codes hidden within the texts of the books, including [Fia's](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2910) bringing suspicion their benefactor.\n\nSoon after leaving The Library, Peasant The Bae meets The Hot Pink One once again, finding that the HPOs are married. Whenever The Hot Pink One speaks, it leaves Bae annoyed though she still eventually agreed to being the SC, supply chain, for HPO's the consort's concert. Throughout the rest of day, Bae would find the Hot Pink One constantly nearby.\n\nAfter some guidance, Bae finds her way to Job Hall to accept her quest and begin her work as a Supplier. Together with fellow Supplier Cecilia Immerkind, they left for the mines to mine Lapis Lazuli, learning on the way of their abilities to improve the quality of their tools. As they gathered materials, Cecilia and Bae bonded over their previously unemployment status and the woes of being chosen as heroes. After gathering more materials, Peasant The Bae soon learns that she would need better quality tools and must purchase them from the seller.\n\nSoon after gathering enough materials, Bae learns that she would need coins to purchase better tools. In order to accomplish this, she sets out to defeat Stains that littered the kingdom and soon enough earnt [enough and more.](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=7007)\n\nGoing back to the Kingdom, Bae finished her job and trades some iron ore to Shakira and receives an upgrade stone.

Gacha would soon leave Bae poor once again as she attempted, and failed (even after receiving gold from Cecilia to save wisely), to obtain any of the special prizes.

Why? Because she remembered everything. And more importantly, she had been tasked by a certain important someone—Fia—alongside Kiara, to oversee operations at the Library. That made her feel special. She was the main character now. Probably.\n\n[I'm your hero](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=d-oTxkczcDfoDeMa&t=1009)\n\nAnd with that self-appointed title came great responsibility: explaining to the others what was happening, what to do, and how to go about it. You know, main character things. She carried herself with pride… which only made the looks she got from others more awkward—especially after she loudly introduced herself as *Mordon Ramsay*.\n\nRegardless, her new journey had to begin. Having been a cook before, it was no surprise that Calli chose to become a [chef](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=vJIwAPJzVnd5H6Yo&t=1666) again. As for the world-saving stuff—how she was one of the “Falling Stars” destined to rescue the universe? Yeah, no one really cared about that. Mordon Ramsay was here to cook, and cook she shall.\n\nShe quickly befriended her new (or were they old?) comrades, including the likes of Gonathon (see [Calli-Gonathon: My Dawg](#edge:calli-gigi)). She had a lot of “dawgs.” She formed bonds with [fellow chefs](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=3GeaCgPBFqQL-cAU&t=3179), started questing, and got used to the mechanics of the new kingdom.\n\nWith the basics out of the way, she turned to her true ambition: [opening a shop](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=Y4GcVRFhNDwNYn6w&t=4391)—again. But this time, it would be grander. Better. More delicious food. More divorce services. More charging married couples exorbitant fees. And this time… maybe even a few employees. Her last tavern was built with a green theme to reflect the Jade Sword colors, but since guilds were no longer a thing, she pivoted. Maybe bricks this time—for that solid, grounded, “no tax fraud here” look.\n\nThen came the masterstroke: a secret underground fight club basement. She called it *Dawg Pound*. \n\n[Eating a fist to the face](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=7bkRNUPKvlz0tZ7i&t=9404)\n\nA place for others to throw hands in the name of glory (and entertainment), while the soundtrack was none other than [“Lava Chicken”](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=xfsHwyAD0T8QPExJ&t=12501) sung by Koseki Bijou. Calli, of course, would be sitting pretty, raking in the profits as the crowd roared.\n\nIt was thrilling. She got straight to work laying the foundation—literally—for the Dawg Pound, pushing aside all that “save the world” and “recover your memories” stuff. Journals? Nah. Fight club first. Priorities. And in true Calli fashion, she was locked in.\n\nBefore, well, others planned on ruining her business\n\n[OI!!!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=_NKA4AiEGnoMhNqK&t=15668)",

No thanks. Supplier? Too bland. Jeweler? Too bougie. Even if the ruler of the kingdom got on her knees and begged, Shiori would have happily remained unemployed. But alas, society always had a way of forcing her hand. Begrudgingly, she chose to be a Chef—not because of any altruistic desire to feed the people, but because it gave her the perfect excuse to [poison](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=XKamh_0_UlRKCyzN&t=1816) them. A true hero.\n\nThus began the tale of perhaps the most dangerous chef the kingdom had ever seen. One who casually referred to a random woman as [Pickle](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=5acuSuxcDzRRtjdl&t=2667), spoke freely of burying gold and breeding pigs, and generally operated in ways no one could predict. And yes—she cooked. A lot.\n\nTo everyone’s shock (and mild horror), Shiori turned out to be exceptionally good at it. She cooked up a storm and hit over 1500 coins before anyone could blink. But for Shiori, it wasn’t enough. A new idea took root—not opening her own shop (too much effort), but rather, what if she... sold her goods on *someone else’s* shop?\n\nAnd so the Oreo Maiden’s devious schemes began. The unfortunate target? Whichever poor soul owned the establishment she decided to “borrow”.\n\n[Undercutting is crazy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=Y_mj_z_Qpgx2OJKj&t=11795)\n\nIn no time at all, Shiori transformed from misunderstood oddball to infamous kingdom scammer, surpassing even the speed record previously held by FaunaMart. Her notoriety spread far and wide, reaching even the ears of reclusive figures like Tam Gandr, who typically couldn’t be bothered with trivial social noise.\n\n[There there](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=oYopwgLcQ619PkeF&t=13380)\n\nAll in all, a flawless start to her new culinary life of chaos.",

Cecilia then gazes out the window and makes a vow:\n\n[Saving you and the world](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?si=V7s8jRdSb-bw9IzT&t=8520)\n\nShe returns to the job hall where the adventurers are toiling with their work to accomplish their tasks when she meets Tanakisha Karia where they learn they are cousins (see [Cecilia-Kiara: Cousins](#edge:cecilia-kiara)) and declare a rivalry to become the most kind. After a tiring day, Immerkind sets up shop next to Jonathan and visits Mordon Ramsey and Shiori of the Novella at their restaurants for respite. \n\nAfter a long first day, Immerkind returns to the artist Pygmalion and marvels at the beauty of the completed piece.

The group had a short stint, relating over not remembering their own names, which would ironically be a great icebreaker prompt. She searched for aim between the thousands of books lining the shelves of the Library, acknowledging her presence in the distant past.\n\nShe struck up conversation with Shiori of the Nyavella, though “trying to” would be more apt descriptor considering the lively sounds of fifteen voices overlapping within the building. They shared brief banter, before the greater group came together for the debriefing from Mori Calliope and Kiara.\n\nThe nameless maiden took interest in learning the crafts of culinary arts to get by throughout the week. She was on the straight and narrow, focusing on exploring the castle grounds as she completed the Princess’ quests. She placed much trust in fellow Chef Mordon Ramsay to save Ancient Libestal, taking in her well-informed advice on the state of the land. She even agreed to become Mordon’s sous chef in her upcoming tavern, such great developments for her budding career.\n\nThe woman with crimson hair reappeared, distrusting of her apparent amnesia, to the point of accusing her to be a witch!

A cat named [Fia](#node:fia) tells her and the other heroes that they have been sent back in time to an earlier state of Libestal. The REAL Libestal, not the phony version everyone was once trapped in. While some details are clear as crystal and painful to bear, she had forgotten some details due to the effects of time travel.\n\nShe keeps her title more as a formality than a status, wishing to do good in this world to make up for what she had done before. She also remembers things about the other heroes she was once close to. While Ina remembered being her dear sister, the Hot Pink One completely forgot about Bijou and started calling her brother instead (see [Bijou-Hot Pink One: Onii-chan](#edge:irys-bijou))\n\n\nPrincess Bijou quickly realizes she must take up a new lifestyle, as the role of \"Princess\" is already taken at this point in time. For some of the heroes, this doesn’t mean much more than taking up any old occupation. As a (former) princess who lived as a carefree royal for all her life, Bijou is distraught to become one with the common folk and... [GET A JOB.](https://youtu.be/pEAXwijhfFY?t=1762)\n\nBijou decides to become a Jeweler—the most natural choice for her, as a rock person. She could even take parts of herself apart if she has to. She soon finds company with others who also took up the same role. Roa, a jewel entrepreneur, is quick to bring innocent jewelers like Bijou under her wing as employees for her up and coming business. Through their partnership, they realize the potential of selling charms to the other heroes.\n\n\nOur Princess isn’t used to the commoner life. She was once spoiled by being so rich that money was of no object. The realization of having to make her own money, and thus soiling her hands with hard work… was a very foreign concept for her. Nonetheless, she forged on, determined to build her business. [\"Princesses don't earn, they receive!\"](https://youtu.be/pEAXwijhfFY?t=6275)\n\nLate into the day, Bijou would be the only jeweler left around. Several of the heroes would come to her to buy one or more charms for their own adventures, letting her rake in the cash. Between this and completing a lot of side quests, she could get used to this!\n…Perhaps avoid doing business underwater, lest you drown in the process.\n\n[Hold your breath…](#embed:https://youtu.be/pEAXwijhfFY?t=15743)\n\nThe rest of her day is spent building what will become the establishment for her charm business with Rao and the other jewelers.

Most of it went in one ear and out the other. What _did_ catch her attention, though, was when Calli mentioned that everyone was expected to keep a daily journal of their journey. Writing? The Hot Pink One? Absolutely not. She hated words with a passion. So, in true Hot Pink fashion, she tried to weasel her way out of it by claiming to be illiterate. A grown woman pretending not to read—classic.\n\n[I'm illiterate](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=Z_8Eg398E6IO1buZ&t=830)\n\nTo avoid anything that might require literacy, she chose a job that wouldn’t involve [reading or writing](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=HR2XQ6PjVgzkLghk&t=1475): Chef.\n\nAnd with that, her new journey began. Almost immediately, her infamous “Hot Pink Aura” started drawing people in. Cecilia Immerkind quickly reminded her that HPO stood for “Hard Potential Oliver” and that they were the best of friends. Bijou, after a brief conversation, remembered her too—and they instantly became sworn brothers (see [Cecilia–Hot Pink One: Huh puh](#edge:cecilia-irys) and [Bijou–Hot Pink One: Onii-chan](#edge:irys-bijou)).\n\nShe then reunited with NinoIna and Peasant the Bae, reestablishing their previous connections—Consort and Peasant respectively (see [Hot Pink One–Ina: Consort, again](#edge:ina-irys)).\n\nThen came Tam Gandr—Timmy, as the Hot Pink One decided to call her (see [Tam Gandr–Hot Pink One: Timmy and Pinky](#edge:irys-kronii)). What followed was a classic bonding session covering truly meaningful topics like siblings, not being blood-related, and... other vaguely questionable things\n\n[I don't know anymore](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=TuCyb-7ATGOS-iDP&t=3222)\n\nEventually, after a _lot_ of distraction, she managed to gather enough materials to make a cooking pot and began her culinary career. With Nerissa’s help, she whipped up a few bowls of savory vegetable soup.\n\nShe also got wind of the Shiori Nyavella [scam saga](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=toRAAJgyNlb9mNMJ&t=12409) and decided to try selling her own goods—right in front of someone else’s shop. Naturally, she was promptly kicked out. Understandably so.\n\n[How dare you kick me out!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=34ktoCQAfec2Yv2Z&t=17922)\n\nIn the end, she opened her own shop—a [pink one](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=4DWyjnCRm8GAkJ9g&t=22870), of course, to match her energy. And finally, with great reluctance, she ended the day by writing her journal. A slightly chaotic, very pink beginning to what was sure to be a memorably unhinged culinary journey.\n\n[So is she illiterate still?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=UY3BYIdiRmn1_UHr&t=24060)",

            "title": "Nino Ina / The Hot Purple One",
            "content": "She was inexplicably trapped in a chamber of glowing ivory, and mews of *some distant Promise* enveloped her focus, if only for a moment, but that didn't stop Ina from getting her coffee water in order. Spotting some familiar figures within earshot of her, puzzle pieces of past memories immediately fell into place — NinoIna's title of Hero, and her sister, who she once freed from the influence of Ruination, all history from the lost mirage that was the realm of Libestal.\n\nA fellow fluent catto speaker helped Ina recount her previous journey of Empathy, confirming the King of the false Libestal as a masquerade of the Outsider. Beyond the Library shelves was the true Libestal back in the past, which harbored the genesis of the Outsider (no thanks to the birds and the bees — and some alleged fairy godmother), and The Librarian’s scattered memories paramount to unraveling the Outsider’s destiny.\n\nThe Library was soon full with the other fourteen \"Shining Stars\", and the two Lore Keepers among them gave a tour of the place. Ina had different plans though, she was busy perusing bookshelves and brushing with Fia.\n\n\nNino “Starlight” Ina was intercepted by Princess Iphania and her guards. They escorted her into the Kingdom’s final bastion, where the Princess declared desire to defy Libestal’s Prophecies foretelling doom in seven days. Ina entertained the Princess' wish of repelling the looming malevolence *togethaaaa*! After deliberation with some disembodied voices, Ina gravitated towards the crafting of Charms, choosing work under the mentorship of Grand Jeweler Chrys.\n\nFor a few moments, Ina [kept her head down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=2010s) and struggled to find her way out of the Job Hall. In a detour to speak to the Princess, Ina bumps into a dark-caped character [seemingly well-spoken in the Libestan tongue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=2080s). Fia’s memory fragments, which crashed onto the land as felled stars, had become strongholds of the Ruination. Ina was to seek assistance from the court’s mages as they gradually map out safe paths to travel to those Star Sites throughout the week. That was, if she could channel her navigation skills to find the castle exit.\n\nWith the magic communications relic found on her person, Ina was mysteriously compelled to establish telepathic connection with a random peasant for a jape. While gathering intel on the first \"Star Site\" to visit on the next day, she overheared the self-introduction of a humble chivalrous knight, perhaps a comrade of days past? *NinoIna* had placed a nametag conveniently atop her head for easy identification, much to the benefit of... her Queen? No, that can't be, this person [eats paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=2540s). A fine demonstration for that peasant, at least, for knowledge is superfood.\n\nSome of the books in the Library held [illegible text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=2848s); It might be Ancient Libestal script, or even a cipher for hive-minds to solve. From what was still readable, though, she learned of an unnamed Library authority whose position that cat succeeded.\n\nIn a bizarre twist of fate, Ina reunited with her eternal consort, who the peasant seemed to be [cosmically at odds with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=3150s) (see: [Ina-Hot Pink One: Consort, again](#edge:ina-irys)). The group crossed paths with a bubbly Tam Gandr (she's low-key about it), who Ina now called \"Tammy\".\n    \nIna was eager to shirk the status of unemployed Hero and attain grand riches, embarking on a [Clean and Simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=3917s) beeline to the Job Hall, but got lost (again) in the [dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=3976s) hallways of the castle labyrinth.\n    \nThe Grand Jeweler entrusted Ina with the initial task of procuring materials to craft a Basic Crimson Charm. On her way out the Kingdom walls, she saw the Hot Pink One and co. loitering about the Enchanted Wagon arguing joblessly.\n    \nVenturing out to the remnants of the Cliffs of Sidero, Ina began her arduous mission of getting sidetracked. A true Hero on the hunt, no Stains nor Stain-like wild cows were spared; Handmade Steak is always handy to have. Through sheer instinct, Ina sought after the experience of battle in the fields, quickly yet steadily accustoming herself to her Revelation in combat — who knew that magical projectiles from an ancient tome would be outpowered by its melee counterpart of a hundred papercuts? Despite her best efforts, Ina got overwhelmed by the terrible Flying Stains, thus she retreated to safety to recover.\n    \nAfter a brief first meeting with a fellow Jeweler (BAU BAU), Ina joined hands with a quill-wielding lady, forming a party of introverts to adventure to the caves on the side of the Cliffs. Ina took her leisure gathering raw Iron and Coal from the magically regenerating ores, before parting ways with her party member of five minutes. Armed with more confidence, she stayed on the plains hunting Stains, likely becoming the first among the Shining Stars to reach the upper limit of experience she could gain within the day.\n    \nIna was making good progress on her first Jewel-working task, when she became enamored by the beautiful sights of the mature untended fields next to the castle. As she uprooted and replanted the wheats and potatoes, [a faraway whisper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=6909s) motivated her to pour her heart and soul into honoring the potato harvests. Ina vowed to make the \"potato fairy\" proud through her dedication (see: [Elizabeth](#node:liz)).\n    \nIna ran into her eternal consort in the outskirts of the plains, and joining the HPO-Squared family unit was the Hot Pink One's now-brother Gonathon. Roa snuck some of Ina's baked potatoes, unknowingly inducting herself into Ina's new \"Potato Club\". Ina aimed to continue that approach to rope more warriors into the club (though she never managed to fully follow up on this thereafter.)\n    \nBack in the castle, Ina practiced crafting her very first Charms, learning the high-randomised quirks of the craft. While advancing through her career, she also began procurement of materials to strengthen her Revelation via Kiara and her brother-in-law. Unfortunately, she also heard through the very much *not* soundproof walls about the disbandment of her short-lived party, much to her sadness.\n\nHPO-Squared and Bijou had a lively barter negotiation of their respective services, with Ina receiving scrumptious Potato Salad from her eternal consort. Even so, she developed some jealousy over the blood-brothers' close relationship.\n    \nRoa cornered the currently-independent Jeweler Ina to inquire on her non-profiteering business practices. Later on, Ina was beckoned to join Roa and Bijou at the Lucky Lounge, conducting their first union meeting as Jewelers to discuss a joint venture, in a thinly-veiled attempt by Roa to monopolize the *gacha*-fied Charm market. With a preliminary agreement to sell Basic Charms at 150 Coins, the Jewelers settled on their future shop name \"Ga*charms*\".\n    \nRecognising the great firepower potential within her magic tome, Ina made good time on upgrading her Revelation using relatively cheap material costs, and a timely leverage of the Smiths' early labor rates of free. At this point, she was potentially the most powerful ally of Libestal in terms of battle experience and Revelation strength.\n    \nThe cautious self-proclaimed Hero toiled the rest of the day away clearing the entire Quest board gaining many a Coin, plus experience that she could no longer take in due to the technical fatigue of battle. Regardless, she was content with completing her commitments, getting a view of the [beautiful artworks in Pygmalion's gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=12937s) and spending some of her disposable income on failed attempts to get a new hat.\n\nWith a token of [Mordon Ramsey's goodwill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=13151s) in her pocket, Ina staved herself off the enticement of gambling and retreated to the Library, where she pioneered a page on her brand-new Journal documenting her path to strength. [Her entry today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=13685s) was brief, not because of her desire to turn in early, but because she probably forgot what happened today.\n    \n    \nMEOWMEOW",

And the first thing she did upon seeing said cat? She called it [fat](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=HUKTRLtdetft9DSn&t=554). A flawless introduction.\n\nTam—or was she Tam? The blue maiden couldn't recall. Her name, her past journey, even her former comrades were but faint echoes in her mind. Foggy, half-remembered fragments. But she didn’t seem to care. As ever, she remained completely deadpan, even in the midst of chaos and confusion.\n\nOthers, however, seemed to remember her. Calli was the first to call her by name—Tam Gandr—followed by Gonathon, who felt an odd sense of loyalty toward her (see [Gonathon-Tam: A Sense of Loyalty](#edge:kronii-gigi)). Elizabeth? She straight up remembered Tam, no doubt about it. Even the Hot Pink One chimed in with a nickname of her own (see [Tam-Hot Pink One: Timmy and Pinky](#edge:irys-kronii)).\n\nStrangely enough, Tam became something of a focal point. Perhaps it was the uniqueness of her name—or perhaps something else—but people seemed drawn to her. \n\n[What did you call me?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=UgoR7e-WfOs8ARgy&t=3782)\n\nAnd yet, name or no name, the Tam-ness of Tam still shone through. Her signature snark, sharp side comments, and faint air of [superiority](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=vZp0hb6TVjwCsmUK&t=3549) lingered. Once a queen, always a queen… even if no one remembered her reign.\n\n\nMoving on, when it came time to pick a job, Tam chose to be a Supplier. The idea of gathering materials appealed to her, so she wasted no time getting started. She even managed to trade some of her early findings for a snazzy [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=GRs1MgjdHWSBgNzw&t=8470).\n\nAfter that, she began building her [abode](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=FQg3zwZiabQwSxev&t=12197) and took a little detour to investigate the widely-gossiped \"scammer shop\" run by none other than Shiori Nyavella. It didn’t go well—Tam unintentionally exposed how broke she was when she couldn't afford a single thing from the shop, even with a discount.\n\n[I'll be right back](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=Vw4r0ymqmj9shtiH&t=13306)\n\nEventually, Tam settled down to write her journal entry for the Library, reflecting on the bizarre start to her journey and the strange, memorable people she had already encountered.\n\n[Tam writing her diary](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=EWtPKvo1Fk35j255&t=15167)",

When Elizabeth was off building in solitude, Nerissa was there, keeping her [company](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=A837PYRSHvJus1sJ&t=8673). And when Nerissa wandered off to tend to her own matters, Elizabeth was never far behind—[watching](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=YfAOcQoIOWbai1uL&t=5607) over her, just like she always used to.\n\nMaybe not all was lost. Maybe something still lingered between them. Until that day came—until Nerissa Ravencroft remembered—Elizabeth wouldn’t change a thing.\n\n[What's my name?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=Bibgd_RaoXYFdYtI&t=4831)",

Perhaps because this was their love language. Or maybe because she couldn’t be bothered. Either way, the two fell right back into their usual rhythm—whatever that rhythm was. Love? Servitude? Mutual delusion? No one could really tell. But it worked for them.\n\nWhat was certain was that their bond, however undefined and slightly unhinged, was real. Real enough for nicknames. Real enough for jabs. Real enough for something that looked a lot like familiarity—whether that was a blessing or a curse remained to be seen.\n\n[Hot Pinky](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=f42euvBlmDcBAsdY&t=4390)",

While on the surface their constant efforts to help one another seem to be born of mutual respect and a desire to assist one another, on closer inspection it becomes apparent that Shiori views Gonathon as an easy mark, at least at first. \n\nIn their first encounter, Shiori attempted to [scam Gonathon out of all of her gold](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=9251), but seemingly reversed herself upon realizing just how naive and generous the humble knight was. The two then adventured for a while, quickly forming a bond due to their mutual hatred of all things flying. Shiori would go on to teach Gonathon how to milk a cow before the two parted ways. \n\nThe next time Gonathon would encounter Shiori would be where the knight's values were put to the test. Shiori earnestly requested Gonathon's aid in her feud with Morden Ramsey, [claiming her rival chef was demeaning her store](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=12331). However, Gonathon would soon learn the truth, and indignant over Shiori's betrayal sought to reveal her crimes to Tam Gandr. Upon reading a [seemingly heartfelt letter](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=13233) from Shiori thanking Gonathon for purchasing her food, Gonathon retracted her accusations. \n\nAfter writing her own letter to Shiori in which she struggled with the pricky topic of the Chef Wars, Gonathon became determined to learn more about Shiori, expressing a belief that Shiori meant well. Only time will tell whether this proves true, or whether the tricky Archiver continues to prey on the naive knight.\n\n[I only need to get to know her better!](#embed:https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=15101)",

A brutal game of market survival, where any tactic, no matter how underhanded, was fair play in the war of commerce. Sabotage, unionization, market manipulation—everything was on the table. From booming startups to lonely chefs tossing out yet another unsold chocolate cake, it was cutthroat, chaotic, and kind of impressive.\n\n![Roa and Co's business: Gacharm](/images-opt/gacharm.webp)\n\nResources were abundant and waiting, as new lands opened up for exploration—offering not just fresh adventures, but also valuable materials ripe for profit.\n\nBut beyond the economic battleground, the main quest of the day loomed: the opening of the first dungeon—**Star Site: Elpis**. A place that demanded cooperation to conquer, and in return, would restore the memories of a certain woman clad in hot pink.\n\n![The heroes battling the Stain King Elpis](/images-opt/elpis.webp)\n\nAnd speaking of hot pink, that one was *everywhere* today. Whichever direction you looked, there she was, entangled in yet another wild, unhinged, and somehow meaningful interaction. The web of relationships spun around her only grew more chaotic and expansive by the hour—fitting for a day centered around memories, mishaps, and maybe just a bit of madness.",

Later, she was invited by Nerissa to join Cecilia and Elizabeth in tackling the [Star Site: Elpis Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/a940cWsshj4?si=UY5Oz5F1CLczMmM1&t=2686).

For nearly the entire day, she was rarely seen with anyone else—not even near her counterpart, Mococo. She remained laser-focused on her dream of cooking for others, knowing that it would take real effort to get there. And it paid off. She earned a small fortune, possibly becoming one of the richest in the kingdom with over 6000 coins. With that much capital, she finally laid the foundation for her very own [shop](https://www.youtube.com/live/a940cWsshj4?si=btIhScSR8a7IJhij&t=11706)—her ultimate goal coming into view.\n\nEverything was going well. She was always doing her best... Yet there was a hint of melancholy. Despite her efforts, she wasn’t part of the shenanigans the others were caught up in. Fuwawa couldn't help but wonder—once her shop was finished, would anyone even come?\n\nStill, the fluffy one had to stay optimistic. Only by holding on to that hope could she bring smiles to others’ faces.\n\n[Journal Entry for Day 2](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/a940cWsshj4?si=FUlM9YlDNyFTYcRj&t=12627)",

Unlike her sister, who would do anything for others, Mococo would do anything for herself (and her boss’ store, Gacharm, of course... probably).\n\nThe contrast between the two sisters ran deeper than just ideology. While Fuwawa quietly spent the majority of her day working alone, Mococo was constantly surrounded by interaction. She called a random bystander [suspicious](https://www.youtube.com/live/xLWZay9gLBY?si=vAnIIU64NtB2I7xh&t=6183) for no reason, bartered and traded, and got help whenever something was beyond her means.\n\nSo, with so many pleasant encounters throughout the day, it made perfect sense that Mococo would journal in her diary... not about heartfelt moments or personal growth, but about how many sales she made and her ambitious plans for economic domination.\n\n[Deary diary...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xLWZay9gLBY?si=SpQDxoENvcwy2x1_&t=12407)",

To preserve the memories of her journey, her feelings, she chose to commit them to paper.\n\n[Knight's log: 0001](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=F8vVFLc7Z6fvVmx5&t=141)\n\nJade Sword, knight of honor and chivalry—those were still the principles the red-clad knight held close. Even in a new land, under a different ruler, and surrounded by those who might have forgotten her, her sense of duty, her honor, and her role as one of the \"Shining Stars\" kept her moving forward.\n\nWith that resolve, she began her new day, signing her letter as the scarlet knight she was: Elizabeth ~~Romeo~~ Rose Bloodflame (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: The Fumbler](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\nShe had two goals for the day: actually do her job as a smith, and tackle the Star Site: Elpis Dungeon. The former came easily—she jumped straight into upgrading her weapon, which turned out to be much simpler than she’d anticipated. The latter, though, presented a different challenge—not in difficulty, but in deciding who to enter the dungeon with.\n\nFortunately, that question was soon answered. While helping Nerissa upgrade her weapon, the songstress invited her—along with Cecilia and Fuwawa—to take on the dungeon together.\n\nIn the meantime, Elizabeth took on some quests—because, frankly, she was broke. During this, she shared a... let’s say *interesting* exchange with Cecilia. Friendly? Maybe. Quirky? Definitely. The lady in green was far weirder than Elizabeth remembered (see [Elizabeth-Cecilia: Are You Okay?](#edge:cecilia-liz)).\n\nLater, the team entered the [dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=RswqYsQvMw0bMKm5&t=4650). It was packed with puzzles and demanded teamwork to succeed, but after many—*many many many*—falls, they finally triumphed over the boss and recovered IRyS’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=zwOuOP18N9MN1rsA&t=7953).\n\nAfterward, Elizabeth resumed her smithing duties. And yet, despite all the effort, she somehow remained flat-out poor. So, a bit exhausted and more than a little defeated, she turned to what any righteous knight would do in their downtime: prank people.\n\n[*I will eat your eyes*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=uwFsQZoNgN5PsqYa&t=9848)\n\nToward the end of the day, she joined Kiara and Shiori to explore the Stronghold of Ruin, capturing cinematic shots of the [stunning scenery](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=P3mmCuJ4ecTixSHu&t=13604)—a peaceful close to a long and eventful day.",

With that in mind, Bae quickly used her construction box to gather mud, for it is the best suited material for a Peasant-owned shop, and Acacia leaves... Of which is vaguely familiar to The Bae. But it is not enough so, Bae sets out to gather more materials and perhaps gain more experience.\n\nA coward no more, Bae's understanding of her Revelation and her strength as a hero grows after each battle.

The answer escapes her as unfortunately, being poor left much of Bae's maths skills null but fortunately, the voices in her head helped her solve that she would need 64 lapis lazuli and even suggested a fitting name to the shop: [tHE dUMPSTER!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=1764). The Peasant The Bae's tHE dUMPSTER: Where one man's trash is another's treasure!\n\nSoon after, she meets The Hot Pink One again and began boasting of her shop that will, one day, have things to sell and with it, a free enhancement. Afterwards, Bae seeks Bijou's advice about the emeralds she collected and ultimately managed to sell a stack (plus 5 extra) for 100 gold. Ina too later would be The Bae's first official customer as Bae would upgrade [~~scam~~](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=2714) Ina's pickaxe for 100 gold.\n\nWith newfound confidence, and more materials gathered for The Dumpster, and Bae began filling the empty lot bit by bit. To commemorate the event, she would name her beloved pickaxe and axe, PP and PA respectively, and then... buy more gacha for the [materials of course!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=3602). No regrets were had, clearly.\n\nBut then, Bae remembers her goal: to recover their memories. With a steady breath, she makes amends with The Hot Pink One and joined her, the Consort, and Shiori to tackle the Elpis Dungeon where their teamwork and trust were put to the test. [Multiple times](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=6308). As Elpis Dragon falls before our heroes, The Hot Pink One remembers who she was. Soon after the quest is done, they reported back to the Princess and, then Fia, learnt that the Outlander is indeed a hero and is investigating the Stronghold of Ruins.\n\nNow that Bae has gotten stronger, so did the Stains, and at her current level - defeat is all to common. She goes on a series of quests, to improve her equipment, and at last [Bae The Peasant is now Bae The Peasant with GOLD!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=9443). But, with a price as her beloved PP axe would be mistakenly traded off. Though it was quickly replaced.\n\nAnother thing was amiss, in Bae's staying true to her Peasant nature, Bae has unknowingly slighted Cecilia Immerkind. Never fear for in the end drinks were had with celebration, the hatchet was burried and the two made up - and perhaps, an [attraction](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=10425) has started. Though the moment was ruined by the Hot Pink One and the two once again had heated words.\n\nAccomplished and now rich, The Bae would write down in her journals, the words of Mother echoing in her thoughts, and finished the day.",

Thus was the proud creation of Mordon Ramsay.\n\n[Tour of the tavern](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=s2oebW-2OPVZa5Jt&t=997)\n\nThe place was pink. Pink on all four sides, pink from top to bottom. The roof sparkled with sea lanterns, and the inside was—well, still pink, but a warm, welcoming kind of pink. The main dining area was lined with tables, with sakura petals gently falling from above, a single portrait of the owner herself hung for all to see. Beneath it lay the basement, home to a secret fight club, and above were guest suites of varying classes: Peasant, Knight, and Libestalian King—each with a balcony view of the kingdom’s vast green fields. At this point, it was looking more like a motel than a tavern.\n\nIt was beautiful—but not finished. Miss Mordon had more ideas. She later established a [Therapy Stall](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=cLBaeNYSgM9NfhrZ&t=4070) right next to the tavern: 100 coins for solo sessions, 200 for couples. A chef who could cook, run a motel, and now offer therapy? What *couldn’t* she do at this point?\n\nShe had to do it all, though—the economy was tough, and it was a battlefield for folks like her. Of course, collaboration helped, like the one she had going with [Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=-Az4QRmpYlH1g237&t=2062).\n\nTurning back to the main quest, Mordon teamed up with Kiara, Biboo, Roa, and Mococo for a mission to the [Star Site: Elpis Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=Mcd8vEwgowdvbG3w&t=6353), where they successfully recovered memories of [IRyS](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=8aHIbG2KX1DFLf3y&t=8501).\n\nToward the end of the day, she went out to gather more ingredients for cooking. Unfortunately, she ran into a slew of monsters, so she hired a bodyguard—who promptly failed at being a bodyguard. Mordon returned home, only to once again be assaulted by the one person who seemed to be bugging her business just for the fun of it (see [Mordon-Shiori: Please Leave Me Alone](#edge:shiori-calli)).",

So why would something so cruel happen to her poor little chickens?\n\nStill, what’s gone is gone, and Shiori had other things to focus on. After all, she was running a business—ShiorinEats—delivering food to those in need at (not) very reasonable prices.

But by now, her name had spread far and wide, and even if she was doing anything remotely normal, those around her remained [wary](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=jwnA-XIXNucAjI44&t=4991). Especially one she had previously tormented—mentally.\n\n[I'm just hanging out](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=LPtF6PiDQRb6_vti&t=6559)\n\nBut really, why would anyone be suspicious? She was just a humble delivery girl who maybe tried scamming a poor, broke knight with supposedly discounted [pork chops](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=SU4dNnWgXpyefwAL&t=7050).

Totally normal behavior.\n\nAnyway, toward the end of the day, Shiori journaled her journey on Day 2—a day where she learned about the quirks of others and witnessed various curious events unfold.\n\n[Journal for Day 2](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=jWYO3t1b6Ki-kv-z&t=12609)\n\nShe also gave Gonathon beets, again, for completely [non-suspicious reasons](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=OFSnHhwRpTtRCLr_&t=13186).",

She spent most of that time gathering crafting materials, constructing the shop’s storage area, and knocking out side quests. All for good reason—she wouldn’t be able to stay around for long.\n\nHer hard work didn’t go unnoticed. Her boss, Roa, gave her something to take on her adventures in return: a little Beast Stain hat! [“A friend?! Wait… a friend?”](https://youtu.be/03m4uWAFfQg?t=4938) Somehow, this seemed oddly familiar to Bijou. Thinking about it made her head ache… but hey, it was friend-shaped.

Especially when her little brother was already employed by what looked like the kingdom’s biggest business chain, raking in coin by selling much-coveted goods through gacha.\n\n[Questionable business practice](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=b8NxQYC2U1P93sbS&t=784)\n\nShe tried confronting the store owner for \"corrupting\" her brother—not out of jealousy, of course—but the moment she realized the store sold items she needed, she folded on the spot (see [Hot Pink One–Roa: Pink Union](#edge:irys-raora)).\n\nGiven how rough her situation was, she decided to potentially team up with another broke chef struggling to make sales (see [Hot Pink One–Nerissa: Chef Union](#edge:irys-nerissa)).\n\nBack on track—today was a big day for the pink lady. A dungeon had opened, and this one *called* to her. Not because of its funny name, [Star Site: Elpis](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=kiT67P23j1CsC3Zx&t=3512), but because of the secrets it promised to unveil.\n\nShe joined forces with Shiori, Ina, and Da Bae. The dungeon, floating far above the world, was themed around Angels and Devils. It challenged them with puzzles that required cooperation at opposite ends. Many... *descents* happened, testing the patience of our heroes—mostly due to the pink one’s inability to tell left from right. After navigating three puzzles, they faced the two-headed dragon: Stain King Elpis. But with the combined strength of the four, they emerged victorious.\n\nAnd then, the pink one finally remembered who she was.\n\n[One that brings Hope](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=0Hi16X4sdeWI_MnW&t=6194)\n\nShe wasn’t just a struggling chef trying to sell chocolate cakes—she was IRyS, the Nephilim born of war between Angels and Demons. With her voice, she united both factions, a being people called “a goddess”—albeit an alcoholic one.\n\nThough the revelation was profound, she didn’t change all that much. Maybe she had always been this way.\n\nTo celebrate the occasion, she joined Immerkind and the others for a drinking party by the creek, where IRyS’s commentary made many question her divine status (see [Immerkind–IRyS: Classists](#edge:cecilia-irys)).\n\nBrimming with empathy and goodwill, the pink one later lent a hand to her somewhat close friend Tammy, helping her through the same dungeon (see [Tam–IRyS: Sapphire and Lappie](#edge:irys-kronii)).",

She formed a team to investigate the first crash site alongside two other Shining Stars: the Hero's eternal consort and the gear-Enchanting Peasant.\n\nStar Site: Elpis was designed to deter explorers like them. NinoIna and her betrothed, though forced apart, stood atop contrasting arenas, guiding each other through the mystical mazes of the stronghold.

Wait, did they sign a prenup back in the previous world?\n\nThe victory over Stain King Elpis granted NinoIna's party a renewed fighting spirit, and the limits of their potential expanded. With greater expectations though come greater risk; thus, an excursion to procure a new gem led to [the Hero's first defeat](https://youtu.be/NSOuyMjCxPI?t=7920s) in Ancient Libestan history.\n\n[\"Mother always liked you better...\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/NSOuyMjCxPI?t=8451s)\n\nHaving overcome many trials, NinoIna painstakingly crafted a special wedding charm for her consort, in the image of the Hero's [big red heart](https://youtu.be/NSOuyMjCxPI?t=9590s). Cecilia Immerkind yearned for the closeness they shared with each other, so of course, HPO-Squared offered her a trial period as their \"Above SC\" (Super cute?

The situation was so dire, so awkward, that Nerissa had to resort to the psychic route and communicate *directly into her mind*. That’s not romantic. That’s *tragic*.\n\n[I have a mouth and I must scream](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=OdzATm030ekRJ4KZ&t=627)\n\nThen, to make matters worse, Nerissa opened up—shared her struggles trying to sell her homemade potato salad, clearly putting her heart on the line with this business pitch. She even offered Elizabeth a discount, a sweet gesture from a struggling chef to her friend. And Elizabeth? She couldn’t afford a single thing. Not even at a discount. [*Broke.*](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=IGTI21nWiEMonaNo&t=1476)\n\nAnd just when the blue one *finally* started to piece things together—recognizing Elizabeth from the fragments of their past—the red knight, in all her awkward glory, said... almost nothing. Just a few \"What do you remember?,\" and off to somewhere else she went. Girl, you were *devastated* when you realized the bird lady had forgotten you, and now that she remembers?

Upon learning about IRyS’s growing [alcohol problem](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=pUq6lA_E5OP_5Hkn&t=8066) and how her wife had supposedly put her on a path to rehabilitation, Immerkind, in her infinite wisdom as the pink one’s bestest of friends, made the most *reasonable* decision: invite her to a drinking party by the creek.\n\nThe gathering went just about as you'd expect. Five girls—Bae, Bijou, Roa, Cecilia, and IRyS—each hailing from vastly different corners of society, sat around tipsy and chattering about vital topics such as classism and narcolepsy. You know, typical girl talk.\n\n[Differences in classes](#embed:ttps://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=f-5Cd4a3zXmdMpX9&t=9651)\n\nAs time passed and the bottles emptied, the group began to disperse, until only Roa and the two besties remained—completely and utterly drunk.\n\nAt this point, Roa, with the full confidence of someone ten drinks deep, decided to walk on water. Like Jesus Christ, if Jesus were a furry.\n\nAnd, as with the Son of Man himself, the world just wasn’t ready. The two besties—green and pink—banished her on the spot. Immerkind claimed Roa was far too dangerous to remain. As for IRyS? Her reasoning was… well, *questionable* at best.\n\n[That's a yikes for me, boss](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=fyqwpYA7HUIavSRU&t=10084)",

      "dayRecap": "## Day 3: The Libestal Incest Situation Is Crazy\n\nBefore diving into the juicy chaos, let’s get the “non-important” stuff out of the way.\n\nOn the task front, the day largely revolved around two recurring themes for our heroes: grinding and material gathering. They spent time upgrading their weapons, expanding their businesses, and most notably, investigating the **Stronghold of Ruin**. It was there they encountered the mysterious, nameless swordsman—**the Outlander**—for the first time. He revealed more about his role in this tangled tale and the looming catastrophe tied to the fate of the world.\n\n![Meeting The Outlander in the Stronghold of Ruin](/images-opt/outlander-meet.webp)\n\nThat was how the day *should’ve* gone. But now, let’s talk about the absolute fever dream that was Day 3.\n\nIf you've been paying attention, you’d notice that relationships among the heroes have always been... layered. From lovers to sworn brothers, strangers to long-lost cousins, familial themes have been running strong through the kingdom—and on the surface, that sounds wholesome. Heartwarming, even.\n\nBut no. Apparently, the idea of “family” got a little *too* medieval for our band of “heroes.” Somewhere along the way, what began as playful speculation took a hard swerve into *full-on incest*. That's right—*sweet home Alabama* levels of chaos.\n\nWe had people assuming the kingdom’s ruler and her companions were both siblings *and* lovers. We had a cousin—yep, a cousin—making moves on a relative, and upon getting rejected, nearly spiraled into an emotional breakdown. And from the ashes of all this confusion came the crackpot theory to top all crackpot theories: *everyone* in the kingdom was somehow related. All of them. An entire world of inbred individuals. And from this madness was born a cult. A cult of carbs. The In-Breads. Yes, a religion that believed people were bread—sandwiches even—born of divine inbreeding.\n\n![The In-breads claiming their next victim](/images-opt/inbreads.webp)\n\nSure, there were also love stories. Drama... Wolf pack? Maybe even a couple of healthy, emotionally stable conversations. But none of that mattered. It all got absolutely steamrolled by the unhinged shenanigans of the day. Up, down, left, right—wherever you looked, it was chaos.\n\nAnd the spark that might’ve lit this family-fueled dumpster fire? One orange, fiery bird lady. Who needs logic, morals, or restraint... when you’ve got *family*, right?",

The red knight appreciated the gesture (see [Kiara-Elizabeth: Sugar Phoenix](#edge:kiara-liz)).\n\nOne of her main goals today was to finally get a portrait done—she was the only one without one, and frankly, it was about time. After some back-and-forth to gather materials (missing her horse dearly in the process), she finally got her painting. And it was beautiful.\n\n[Look at that hot lady](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=xnTcW4oA0I5l5zax&t=4441)\n\nShe then moved on to gathering materials, completing sidequests, and finally pulling herself out of single-digit coin status. Along the way, she crossed paths with others, even engaging in friendly duels—one of which was with the witch herself (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Strawberry Red](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\nWith her tasks wrapped up (and [pranks](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=AEpkx-sq8MxwFXQM&t=8458) delivered), the red knight headed to bed.

This shouldn't be, Kiara resolved to support their business and buy more charms from them - and perhaps feed two chicken with one seed - and gift those to Elizabeth.\n\nSteadying herself, Kiara called Cecilia to inquire about her relations but Cecilia did not answer. That did not stop our Knight as she heads out to look for Cecilia. Upon meeting her, Kiara would admit to her heart being ['cracked'](https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=2990) when she heard the rumours. Unable to deny her feelings for the Princess, Cecilia would offer part of her heart to Kiara's refusal, only asking Cecilia to inform her since they are family\n\n[Sweet Home of Mother Matron](#embed:https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=5069)\n\nShe would meet Liz and would gift her the charms she had bought earlier, receiving a warm thanks from the lovely red knight. Soon, Kiara would end up spoiling Elizabeth, giving her construction boxes they would both need for their shop, and a pickaxe. Kiara's noble heart could not help but be endeared by Elizabeth and tells her if there is anything Elizabeth would need - be it coins, equipment, or help - Kiara will be there to support her. The two of them would bond, Kiara listening to Elizabeth missing her trusty steed and suggesting 'chicken jockey' as an alternative. They would talk about their memories, how they both remembered the past when others do not. Kiara would add that Blesseth be the ignorant for knowledge is sometimes painful. \n\nKiara sees the struggles of Gonathan's hardship in the 1st dungeon and would send words of encouragement, hoping to bolster's her fellow orange knight's confidence.\n\n[Shakira's Smithery's Here to Serve!](#embed:https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=10295)\n\nBusiness is blooming before and after the opening of Shakira's Smithery, selling more of her high quality upgrade stones to Nerissa, her first official customer, and Mordan, even refunding the latter when Mordan overestimated the stones she needed. As 'dawgs', Kiara would fondly gave Mordan a discount and receive delicious delicacies in turn. \n\nThe Dawgs, now a pack of wolves with Gonathan, Mordan, and Cecilia, would take on the dungeon together. And carefully they must look it over as Gonathan heard of clues that a treasure is also hidden in the Stronghold of Ruination. They find the fabled Outlander, seeing him trapped in the Stronghold and they will need to conquer it to free him. The puzzles were tricky but our heroes were smarter and soon the Stain King Proto was defeated, the treasured CD procured, and the hero freed. To commemorate this momentous moment, the Pack would take a photo together. Kiara would share another [tender moment](https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=14003) in Mordan's tavern as they listened to the CD.\n\nT'was an enjoyable moment but a Knight's job is never finished as Kiara would report to Princess Iphania and once again met the Outlander by the princess' side. Kiara learns more information about the Ruination and of the distrust the Outlander for them. She would then head to the library to speak of the success of the quest to Fia and meet Gonathan. Unknowingly, their conversation would soon spark a great misunderstanding that would Libestal, and *all of our heroes* their very core.\n\n[Hearts Woes, The Good Knight's Lies](#embed:https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=14392)\n\nGonathan would tell Kiara of his concern towards Cecilia, for he suspects the Princess and the Outlander are in-love. The way they spoke seemed too tender to be platonic. Gonathan feels great guilt for he encouraged Cecilia. Her heart breaking, Kiara would suggest that perhaps the best way is to present another option for Cecilia: Kiara and Cecilia are far, far, far cousins (not-blood related). Kiara convinced Gonathan to wing-man for her and Kiara in turned promised a blind date for Gonathan and that she would watch over them to ensure a successful date.\n\nIn Kiara's journal, she would write of the satisfactions of the day. The forge is done and Kiara and Elizabeth's blossomed, and there is still hope that perhaps she and Cecilia may be one day be more than simply 'cousins'.",

[Bae was born one and will be one for eternity](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=1510). \n\nThe day goes on but as seen before, a day without arguing with the Hot Pink One is a day incomplete; as Bae would blatantly buy another chef's food in front of IRyS, whilst criticizing her cooking skills. They would trade barbs to the amusement of those around them, Bijou even suggesting that two may be fonder of each other in actuality.\n\nThe group, along with Shiori, would dive into the dungeon meeting the famed Outlander. There they learn more of the ruination and sought to free the hero. This dungeon proved to be trickier than the last for it had included [**Math**](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=3408) but it proved no match for Bae's Peasant Intellect. The battles fought were arduous but boosted by the spar early on Bae endured. Eventually, they would fight and win against Stain King Proto, receiving parts of Fia's *meowmery* and treasured disc.\n\nOutlander was then freed from the ruins and tells that this ruin is merely connected - there is another one out there. Despite being distrustful of those who just saved him, he warns them: corruption still held the kingdom in its grasp. Fia would later suggest that perhaps, it should be Bae and her companions to truly save the world and not the Outlander.\n\nThey report back to the Princess, Bae noticed a strange... sense of giddiness from the Princess Iphania upon hearing of the Outlander's rescue. Methinks they are together, thought the Peasant. That perhaps, The Outsider is the result of a [union between the two](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=4400). \n\nBae would continue questing, seeking to take hold of the disc from the first dungeon, she would head there once again along with her group. Disc obtained, they disbanded and Bae set off to mine more diamonds. \n\nAs mined, Bae noticed the concerning amount of death text from Immerkind and called her. Hearing her distraught, Bae grew worried and perplexed asked to meet. While her Immerkind waits for her, Bae suggested for her to kill any of the livestock in order to relieve some of the stress. Upon meeting her, Cecilia mentioned a special bond with the princess which shocked Bae but after reassurance that it was different special bond from theirs relaxed. But then, dropped the bombshell:\n\n[They're... Siblings?](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=6936)\n\nIn shock at the revelation of such a relation, Bae would call Gonathan with a G to confirm what Cecilia said and could only stagger that the Good Knight repeated the answer. There was no reason for Gonathan to lie to her, so Bae did not doubt the knight, rather, the pieces were falling together too well. Every Libestian they met has a similar face, like the Princess and the Outlander...\n\n[The Entire Libestal Kingdom is Inbred](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=7940)\n\nIt is a different land to their own and a different norm. Bae would know more but unfortunately (or not) her Mother skipped this part of her education before she vanished. She has no siblings so she cannot understand. Soon, she and Cecilia would relay this information to Tammy who too would [heavily question](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=7979) Gonathan. Betrothed siblings. A truly earth-shattering knowledge is now in Bae's hands. Naturally, the news must spread and so Bae would inform those around her, citing the Gonathan as the source.\n\nEventually this would lead to Bae, Roa, Bijou, and IRyS to come to another conclusion: Their faces too are alike. Ridiculous, it was at first but as they thought more, denial escaped them. Bae would leave and then rejoin the group to see that a cult had formed: In-Bread.\n\n[To-mah-toh](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=9314)\n\nA cult had formed and Bae had joined them as their Tomato and would later attempt to indoctrinate others into their group. Their goal is to become a giant sandwich. Glory to Sandwich.\n\nShortly after the brief, but lingering, insanity, Peasant The Bae returned to her would-be shop and after hours of work the fruits of her labour blossomed:\n\n[tHE dUMPSTER iS oPEN fOR bUSINESS!](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=14134)\n\nWith the day's almost at the end, Bae would continue to do a few more quests to earn some coin and bought a few more charms, Glory to Sandwich, to arm herself for future adventures. She would find a magnificent painting that truly honours the noble spirit of [Peasant The Bae](https://x.com/Mikururun/status/1899107067182411936) placing it as a finishing touch for her shop.\n\nBut wait, one last thing. With more money to spare, surely it wouldn't hurt to purchase a from one of the vendors. With a promise to earn the gold lost on the morrow, Bae bought the hat and would excitedly share it with Bijou. Bijou, upon seeing what now donned Bae's head, felt a shiver of unease.  She cautioned Bae to be careful and kept well. Bae unawares of the warning, took little head as she wrote down her day in her journal...\n\n[Glory to Sandwich](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=15371)",

But she persisted for Profit, for The Gacharms shop and, of course, for her beloved employees.\n\nStill, Roa is a hero and so she would meet with Nerissa and Tammy, to enter the Stronghold of Ruination together. They met the Outlander and learnt of his plight: trapped in the accursed ruintouched prison, and the key to freeing him was to conquer the Stronghold. Understood and done as the trio would [defeat the Stain King Proto](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=2575) with just a few mathematical hiccups along the way.\n\nA revelation! Roa noted that the Outlander and Princess Iphania are enamored with each other, constantly keeping the other in their thoughts. Though sadly, not an ounce of trust was given to shining heroes from the Outlander for he did not believe. Fellow feline Fia reassured them and suggested that they can become the hero Libestal needs. \n\nThey find the Outlander and the Princess in the guest room where the Princess urged them to work togehter. Roa watched the Outlander repeated his suspicions to the Princess as he left for the next Ruins. Despite this unwarranted untrust, Roa could not help but coo at the lovebirds. Though Gonathan and Cecilia Immerkind would soon insist on a different [type of relationship between the two](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=3215). Roa interjected into the conversation stating that it does not matter for siblings still love each other and love is love. Should siblings love each other as lovers? Love is **Love**, Roa left it at that . \n\nRoa would meet the the Hot Pink One and be fed by her [mouth to mouth](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=3485), to which Bijou would express curiousity but Roa and the Hot Pink One explained that it is something only adults do though the conversation was ultimately null since the brothers and Roa would eat mouth to mouth to mouth.\n\nBijou and Roa left for their shop and Roa was impressed by the profits made while she was away. Seeing that their inventory needs restocking, Roa took it upon herself to craft more charms, completing some more quests in the meanwhile to earn a bit more gold. The business between Peasant The Bae are also quite good as the supplier brought back some Stain materials that Roa needed. But, Bae brought more than just the goods, she brought back [a startling discovery of not just the Princess and Outlander, but of the true nature of Libestal as well](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=5595). Not surprised by the news she already knew, and unphased by the newer revelation, Roa would point out a key feature to support this: the Libestians all have the same face. Following Roa's keen observation, Bijou would add that *they*, the heroes of Libestal from another world, too have similar faces to each other albeit differing in colours.\n\n[We Are In-Bread. Glory to The Sandwich](#embed:https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=6208)\n\nRoa is the ham in the sandwich, such a sentence may not have be spoken of before but it is nonetheless true. Perhaps the trials of the day wore down on the business woman, perhaps something mysterious has (sandwich)spread over these bread-like blocky lands. Whatever the cause, a cult was born and their goal has never been clearer: To follow the bread and turn the entire world into one large sandwich. To accomplish this, they must bring other heroic ingredients into their fold and accept the in-breadness inside them.\n\nShifting her focus back on what truly matters: Gold, Roa knew [advertisement](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=7655) was key to ensure that The Gacharms stayed relevant in the minds of her customers which soon proved very effective as Bae would wonder by mentioning she received the AD though had skippa skippa it. Of course, it was only natural to of course send another one to Bae and to others.\n\nAs her day drew to a close, Roa would spruce up the shop's exterior creating a much more chic design to reflect the growth of her business.\nA third day done well despite the rocky start.

This certainly helped the others with their side quests and dungeoning—ESPECIALLY the dungeon.\n\nThat wasn’t all that was on Bijou’s mind today, far from it. She sniffed out something fishy between the Outlander and the Princess, as their dialogue made it sound like they could be related. She wasn’t the only one to pick up on this, as rumors about this started to spread like wildfire from other sources.\n\nInnocent Bijou would catch wind of some peoples’ conversations  around town while doing her quests, making her stand as still as a rock to listen. In one such case [she was caught standing in plain sight](https://youtu.be/A97SrozF36w?t=16800) with her mouth agape. Eventually, she decided she couldn’t just stand around. Something about pink ladies being related to each other? She had to learn more.\n\nThings REALLY started to turn on its head when Bae started spilling the tea with her. She had heard from Cecilia Immerkind about the Outlander and the Princess being SIBLINGS. She also brings up something Tammy apparently said to her: what if the citizens of Libestans are inbred? This causes Bijou and the two pink ladies next to her (Roa and IRyS) to spiral. They all notice similarities with the faces of the Libestans… and each other. What if THEY were inbred themselves? […LITERAL in-*bread*s?](https://youtu.be/A97SrozF36w?t=18688) From this, a cult of in-breads rises.\n\n[Gossip of the Town](#embed:https://youtu.be/A97SrozF36w?t=18452)\n\nWord also started going around about a haunted cape going around town, according to her brother IRyS. Bijou didn’t seem to buy it because she saw him drink a potion of invisibility in front of him mere minutes before. Taking a page from her brother, however, she decided to sneak a listen of a conversation IRyS had with Tam Gandr, causing Bijou to become the very thing IRyS warned about… but worse.\n\n[Vulgar language](https://youtu.be/A97SrozF36w?t=20390)\n\nThe rest of the day was calmer by comparison as others left for the day. After writing her daily journal entry, Roa and Bijou start polishing up the shop’s exterior. She signs the book at the end of the day, left wondering what will come of everyone’s relationships tomorrow.",

            "content": "A Hero Searches for His Purpose\n\nReturning from his day training in the forest, Gonathon had much to catch up on, chief among them being the need to complete not one, but two dungeons. However, what initially looked to be a simple day of adventuring soon became anything but.\n\nMuch of Gonathon's day would be intertwined with Cecilia Immerkind (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: Wolves Before Harlots](#edge:cecilia-gigi)). Immerkind revealed her greatest desire: to win the love of the Princess of Libestal. Eager to assist his dawg, Gonathon agreed to help her. Moved by Gonathon's kindness, Immerkind declared that they had become more than dawgs, they were now wolves, and this led to the creation of the Wolf Pack, with Mordan Ramsey, Kiara, and Tam Gandr eventually joining as well.\n\n[You are truly kind.](#embed:https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=2020)\n\nSetting aside Immerkind's plot for the time being, the two wolves joined Princess Bijou and Nerissa in tackling [Star Site: Elpis](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=4404). After a long and hard fought adventure, Gonathon was able to recover a part of his memories, with a group of mysterious blonde angels reminding him of something precious.\n\n[Those angels that I saw...with their short, blond hair](#embed:https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=7532)\n\nUpon their triumphant return and after upgrading his smithing rank and acquiring new quests, Gonathon once again found himself in the company of Immerkind. It was here that Immerkind once again gave Gonathon some important words of wisdom: [to not let the past define who he was in the present](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=9664). Gonathon in turn expressed his desire to fight for the pack, and the two once again cemented their ironclad bond to each other.\n\n[The pack is the only truth!](#embed:https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=9538)\n\nWhile a [second dungeon conquest](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=12253) served as another boost of morale, what followed proved to be the spark that would sow chaos in the kingdom. Urged by Kiara to set her up with Cecilia (see [Gonathon-Kiara: A One-Sided Rivalry, A Two-Sided Pact](#edge:gigi-kiara)), the naive knight convinced Immerkind that the Outlander and Princess were in fact siblings. Whether this was a fib or what he truly believed, this rumor spiraled out of control, leading to the formation of an entire cult that Gonathon remained largely oblivious to.\n\nThe end of the day saw one of the most unexpected twists, with Gonathon falling madly in love with Shiori of the Nyavellas (see [Gonathon-Shiori: The Diamond and the Black Pearl](#edge:gigi-shiori)). While Shiori's true intentions were still uncertain, this affair served as a temporary reprieve for the troubled knight, and as he wrote his daily journal he mused on the future and her happiness. But could this joy truly last? And what of the fragments of memories that continue to close in all around him? Only time will tell what awaits the Humble Knight in the next few days.\n\n[Writing her daily journal](#embed:https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=20429)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[Gonathon... by Yog](https://x.com/massiveyog/status/1919634283809144908?s=46&t=Hs_QRLG_ayqKN5hO2BW3-A)\n\n[The Humble Knight's Happiness by Blaparky](https://x.com/blaparky/status/1919657314384282081)\n\n[...

But the spirit was still there. Groggy or not, the pink menace set off to knock out her daily quests.\n\nThat morning daze didn’t last long, though. A phone call from her brother snapped her back into reality: someone shady had been snooping around her shop. IRyS went to investigate, ready to confront a shadowy figure… only to be met with an unexpectedly wholesome surprise (see [IRyS-Bijou: Birthday Girl](#edge:irys-bijou)).\n\nAnd just like clockwork, the pink one remained a gravitational pull for the weirdest of interactions. One after another, people kept walking up to her with the strangest of conversations (see [Cecilia-IRyS: Potential Cult](#edge:cecilia-irys)). At this point, she might as well start charging consulting fees.\n\nSketchy conversations behind her, IRyS moved on to the main event of the day: the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=EFADi02eXHVT3guy&t=2633). She joined up with her brother, the Peasant, and Shiori for the dungeon run. While it wasn’t a major dungeon, it had its fair share of threats—including the cruelest challenge of all: doing [basic math](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=AekGs4GK1BLtsKjh&t=3013). Still, they made it through—though, leading up to it, everyone was strangely eager to show off their [shiny PPs](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=oN4UqMFFhl86YwaP&t=2216) (pickaxes, of course).\n\nPost-dungeon, the group stuck together to retrieve a special record—IRyS’s [very own song](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=0I04ddSjUfu8ZX3v&t=6582)—from the site of her recovered memories.\n\nBack in the kingdom, while looking for more errands to run, she overheard a familiar name. Tammy? Someone else was calling *her* Tammy Tammy? Turning to the voice, she saw *her* Tammy—center stage, surrounded by women. The pink one wasn’t thrilled (see [IRyS-Tam: Is This Jealousy?](#edge:irys-kronii)). \n\nAnd then the day *really* spiraled, as everyone started theorizing how they were all possibly inbred—sorry, *in-bread*. (see [Peasant Da Bae](#node:bae)). Such revelation would cause sane person to suddenly want to, uh, *\"sandwich\"* their little brother, with their big buns.\n\n[I don't know anymore](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=qANkilpIyeBOmiVE&t=9458)\n\nA chaotic day woven in many's sotries, and as the day wound down, with chaos trailing behind her, IRyS wrapped up her night journaling her wild day with her brother, one bread at a time.\n\n[Journaling the bread](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=yEZ_o8DjW8P6YgUw&t=11508)",

The moment she crossed paths with the blue maiden again, encouraging chants echoed through her mind: “Don’t fumble, Milord,” “You got this, Milord.” And she was determined to prove that she did, in fact, got this.\n\nHer strategy was simple: flatter her. Call her beautiful—no, *gorgeous*—praise the majestic feathers by her hips, and even show off a bit of her smithing expertise by crafting an upgrade stone just for her. All while staying calm, cool, and collected.\n\nAnd it was working… until Nerissa gave her a [rose](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=NRlhYHYNbLkCksuF&t=7618) in return.\n\nThat’s when the cracks began to show.\n\n[Uhh, umm...uhhh](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=1dSFxlg0GsDPjdU7&t=7799)\n\n\nFirst came the fluster. Then the fidgeting. Heat crawled up her face. In a desperate attempt to wrestle back control of the situation, she called Nerissa a witch—clearly hoping the accusation would distract from the butterflies wreaking havoc in her chest. But it only made things worse. “How so?” Nerissa asked. And thus began Elizabeth’s spiral.\n\n*“Aha! Witch! I have all the reasons to call you a witch!”*—was likely the train of thought. She tried to recall their past adventures, stacking up “proof” of Nerissa’s sorcery. But each memory only made her more flustered. She claimed the blue maiden cast spells on her. *“What spell?”* Nerissa inquired. “You made my face a strawberry.” *“But how?”* “You hushed my gums.” *“What does that mean?”*\n\nIt meant Elizabeth was scrambling, that’s what.\n\nDesperate to recover, they settled on a sparring match, as if a couple swings of a wooden sword could knock the embarrassment out of her.\n\nElizabeth didn’t need to hold back—she was already nerfed. Swinging her blades, raising her shield, trying to stay focused… all while a majestic blue maiden danced around in front of her, fully immersed in their little spar. Every move Nerissa made was deliberate, serious, graceful. And that sight alone? More than enough to break the composure of the scarlet swordwoman.\n\nIn the end, Elizabeth still won—she *was* a knight, after all. And surprisingly, the match helped clear her head. The fog lifted. She was calm again.\n\nFor about a minute.\n\nNerissa smiled, leaned in, and kissed her cheek. A soft, simple *mwah*. \n\nA \"reward\" for the performance. \n\nThe strawberry glowed so red it might as well have been a beacon.\n\n[Ahhh, umm...

The word “hobby” was thrown like a curse. “You were a good hobby,” said Pinkie. Tammy scoffed, wounded, bringing up *Immerkind* just to provoke some jealousy.\n\nIt was messy. Ugly.

But beneath the familiar tone lay a shared burden: the search for a way to break free from a fate that seemed set in stone. A fate where, each time the Outlander saves the world, he ends up dooming it—birthing the very calamity he sought to prevent, the Outsider.\n\nThe Princess pondered stepping aside, letting the heroes take on the mantle instead. Maybe a different path would lead to a different outcome. But the Outlander, wary and weathered, remained skeptical. If the heroes truly wished to rewrite destiny, they'd need to prove it—not with words, but with action.\n\nAnd so, the Princess gave them their next task: to investigate the next Star Site. Perhaps, within it, lay the answers they were all searching for.\n\n[What comes next](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/uX0rZYSrb4Q?si=UABlcxchRxHiGh_d&t=7144)",

At this point, that’s just tradition. Day Four delivered two things: a time lord, and a Korean soap opera. Two wildly different beasts—yet somehow, both showed up to the same dinner party.\n\nEarly in the day, our heroes zeroed in on the main objective: investigating the second major dungeon, the **Star Site: Chronos**. Here, time reigned supreme—each challenge shackled by ticking timers, counting down as the adventurers scrambled for answers. The theme wasn’t just surface-level either. This dungeon was deeply tied to the memories of a key figure. One that many thought was just a broke, self-declared queen—only to discover she was, in fact, the *Warden of Time* herself.\n\nAlongside that, came a game-changing revelation about the mystery of the Outlander, flipping the narrative on its head and solidifying the heroes' purpose: save the world.\n\n![Ours heroes against the Stain King: Chronos](/images-opt/chronos.webp)\n\nBut let’s be real.\n\nNo one cared about such a frivolous responsibility.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics says that entropy only increases—and if you’ve been following this story, you’d know that law hasn’t missed a single day. Things have only gotten messier since day one.\n\nGonathon with a G—a knight known for his humility, his generosity, his unwavering care—somehow managed to steal Elizabeth’s crown for the biggest fumble of the season. His performance in today’s love drama was so generational, so chaotic, that comparisons were made. To what? *\"A goat being washed\"*. That's how bad it got.\n\nThe knight in orange cooked up a love story so convoluted that most around him either gave up entirely or begged not to be involved. Those unlucky enough to be roped in—yes, even the queen he once served loyally—became collateral damage. Gonathon G? More like *onathon*, because no **G**irls would dare take this person's hands.\n\n![Moments before the \"goat\" fell off](/images-opt/goat.webp)\n\nYet, in the eye of the storm, peace still existed.\n\nElizabeth spent quiet time in her forge, chatting with the voices in her head. Nerissa kept grinding, forever in pursuit of her beloved potato salad. And right in the middle of all the chaos, tucked humbly into the heart of the build zone, stood a cozy little cafe. A cafe that didn’t chase profit, but offered delicious food, handmade with love and fluff. Waiting. Always waiting. Not for gold or fame—but just to make someone smile.",

The objective hadn’t changed: gather resources for building, materials for cooking, and, if possible, find at least one person to accompany her. Because without her usual fuzzy companion by her side, this journey had felt... somber.\n\nAnd as if the world heard her silent plea, a small, feathery friend arrived.\n\n[Hello there, little one!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=Go2F6QDRR0qDVuZC&t=1177)\n\nA chicken. An animal Fuwawa held close to her heart. Her previous journey had revolved almost entirely around tending to flocks, nurturing and loving them as family. To have that feeling return—however small—was like a gentle breeze to a tired soul.\n\nThe chicken was mischievous, tiny, always [darting around](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=2wRpax8PI0MsZJg6&t=1331) at the first chance. Fuwawa had to think of countless ways to keep him from escaping. But once he was secured within the cozy café, she named him _Moco-chan_, a quiet homage to the companion she missed dearly.\n\nFeeling a little more grounded, Fuwawa turned her sights to progress. She reached out to others for help in catching up with the dungeons. First came the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=J38XCoSl-nVt5AHh&t=1863). Then, she joined Shiori, Mococo, and Bae in the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=AMeAFfmmilO48tEp&t=4763). Together, they recovered the memories of [Ouro Kronii](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=2vIMbyUxKOHbQ2y5&t=8554).\n\nThen it was back to work on her café. Materials were still needed, and thankfully, [Shakira](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=a98N053xbj--51z9&t=3509) offered stones to help with construction. Things were looking up. The little owner had [no sales](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=2WqV9LXEoUfycxxp&t=3849) yet, but she was hopeful. Her dream still shimmered in the distance—and for once, she wasn’t alone. Moco-chan was with her.\n\n[Moco-chan~](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=MON2jav5merqyE4a&t=3907)\n\nAt least, for a short time.\n\n[Moco...chan?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=qZPau0VzbYTi2o2i&t=9171)\n\nFuwawa stepped out for errands, and when she returned... Moco-chan was gone.\n\nShe ran. Panicked. Calling out. Searching every corner of the area. But there was no sign of him. Had he wandered too far? Was he okay? Would he come back?\n\nShe told herself not to blame him. She could never. If he didn’t want to stay, she wouldn't force him. Fuwawa only ever wanted the best for others. That’s who she was. But pretending it didn’t hurt? That would be a lie.\n\nShe ended the day as always—writing in her journal. But this entry weighed heavier than the rest.\n\nHer shop stood open, but no one had come to buy anything. Visitors were rare. And when they _did_ stop by, it was to ask for something... or to advertise. Not to sit. Not to chat. Not to stay.\n\nHer dream was starting to flicker. The other chefs were so talented. So successful. Could she ever catch up?\n\nThe café was empty. And Fuwawa sat in that emptiness.\n\n[Bau bau...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=LCtvw4QaRwM0kijj&t=11917)\n\nBut even in a space like that... there was still hope (see [Shakira-Fuwawa](#edge:kiara-fuwawa)).",

And with dreams of swimming in gold already sparkling in her mind, it made perfect sense why she was so eager to clock in.\n\nBut before cashing out, she had some catching up to do. The investigation of the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=mlKGQ7NhgMZ73vBu&t=1871) was still a blank in her itinerary, so she called in reinforcements. With the help of Immerkind, Bijou, Gonathon, and Ina, she powered through and got herself up to speed with the rest of the kingdom.\n\nWhile waddling about afterwards, she happened upon a *very* public therapy session between Mordon and Gonathon. And by “happened upon,” we mean she straight-up eavesdropped, no shame in sight. Though one might question whether it even *was* therapy, considering the kind of advice being handed out.\n\n[There's a window here, yeah?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=1b0WCfas_RRaMR8t&t=3322)\n\nThat’s when the lightbulb hit.\n\nWhy not become a therapist [herself](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=FdwTk8KAoS3pt2ch&t=3721)? Offer budget sessions with bargain-bin pricing and declare herself the most qualified while she’s at it—despite having no actual license or experience. None of that mattered. \n\nAfter planting her flag in the mental health business, she joined up with Shiori, Bae, and Fuwawa to tackle the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=zHdcA0uQyy3zuFUw&t=4759).

Shakira.\n\n[Follow your heart!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=-ZizHO6g5xCSHEr9&t=9493)\n\nShakira poured her heart out, detailing the mess she’d created by accidentally setting up a blind date between Mordon and Gonathon—based on a complete misunderstanding—and triggering a love triangle that caught Shiori in the emotional crossfire. It was a web of drama spiraling out of control, and she was at a loss on what to do.\n\nEnter Mococo: therapist extraordinaire. She listened carefully, took in the drama, and then dropped her sage wisdom: *“Follow your heart.”* Short. Vague. Possibly meaningful.\n\nThen she asked for her payment. Then she hung up.\n\nAnd that, folks, was therapy.\n\nShe closed her day with pride, documenting everything she’d accomplished—highlighting, of course, the mountain of money she raked in from [shop sales](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=ngAzUQ4nmccPecin&t=10939), her paycheck, and her very first therapy gig.

With each step forward, her journey was beginning to take shape. It may have started on rocky footing, sure, but with new knowledge earned and kind souls met—chief among them the mighty phoenix who had helped her so much—Elizabeth now felt steadier, more grounded, and more determined than ever to keep moving forward. And of course, in the midst of all the day’s events, her moments with Nerissa stood out—moments she hoped to see more of today (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Frame By Frame](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\n[Log 0002](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=miuGcqt46LMF_GCh&t=95)\n\nHer morning began much like the previous one, with her ever-dependable sugar phoenix once again offering assistance for a major task: investigating the Stronghold of Ruin. Before setting off, Elizabeth took a brief tour around the kingdom, admiring the creations people had built—and couldn’t help but feel a strange déjà vu seeing enormous [floating text](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=gbwqdZGPxPB_RjoQ&t=651) in the sky again.\n\nThe dungeon itself was conquered with success, and with the mission complete, she moved on to gathering materials. During a brief lull, Elizabeth checked in with [Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=ZHTbaG0Zv_dYDNx4&t=5606), who had tried to contact her earlier. What followed was a friendly—if somewhat bizarre—back-and-forth full of playful jabs, as the two debated their way of addressing each other: one being a knight and the other being a witch.\n\nShiori also took the opportunity to promote her growing business, selling \"memories\"—detailed records of each day’s journey. Elizabeth, intrigued, bought a few and read through them, raising a suspicious brow with each entry. \n\n[Her writing is this fire?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=a1GZJG59uOdXfzBc&t=11809)\n\nAs the day continued, Elizabeth focused on improving her forge, even constructing a hidden underground bunker to safely store her goods. Of course, she had a secondary motive too: a perfect place to [prank people](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=ewOxwttSz3l0BUTO&t=22074) without being caught.\n\nShe wrapped up the first half of her day on a warm, wholesome note—spending quiet, meaningful time with Nerissa, as their bond continued to deepen.\n\n---\n**Part 2**\n\nTired and slightly sleepy, Elizabeth still did her best to keep up with her journal. Thoughts wandered to her Jade Forge, to her old animal companions from journeys past—silly memories, sure, but they made her heart ache in a warm, nostalgic way. \n\nBut just as she wrapped up her writing, a sudden flash of thought pierced through her mind. Ominous. Unsettling. A message that lingered longer than it should have.\n\n[\"Are they with you or against you\"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/1tE2N1kP2YA?si=IEaSGDXxGSpZj8xf&t=198)\n\n\nNow then, Elizabeth was *literally alone* in the kingdom at the time. So of course the most logical next step was to challenge a dungeon designed for a full party of adventurers.\n\nElizabeth managed to solve the first puzzle, pushing through with a spark of brilliance and stubborn will—\n...and then she ran out of time.\n\nAnd then she went bye bye.",

She worried that 2 knights would not be enough but, despite the difficulty, they prevailed.\n\nShe would return to an interesting scene as howls could be heard just outside of [Mordan Ramsay's Tavern](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=653). It seemed the Pack is bonding quite well despite the moon not out.\n\nA newly built house in the distance that sent Kiara quite a [tickle](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=782). It reminded her fondly of one she had previously built and though Ina was a bit crossed, both would laugh and parted ways merrily. Kiara appreciated her own forge, marvelling the paintings Elizabeth put up and the improvements made. She was astounded by the [Shrine of Love](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=1038) and wondered if the Elizabeth and Nerissa had progressed their relationship in Kiara's short absence. The basement was another wonderful addition to the forge along with amusing journals framed on the wall.\n\nKiara saw her very dear cousin Immerkind (questionably related?) and complimented Cecilia's new hat but also expressed the she missed seeing Cecilia's head. The conversation would turn to Cecilia's plight yesterday and her woes and Kiara gently scolded her for the [alcoholism](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=1665). Kiara would offer her protection for the dungeon and Cecilia will inform her if there is a spot on her party later.\n\nKiara's love was put to the test when she stumbled on Gonathan's therapy session with Mordan. Her fellow orange knight told her that, unfortunately, Cecilia was against cousin romances. Despite this, Kiara would persevere! She will find a way to win Cecilia over. With that in the back of hermind, Kiara whisphered in turn about the blind date she set up for Gonathan.\n\nBut it seemed there is more to worry about Cecilia. First was Cecilia's loan from Bae that had a 100% interest rate. Second, the special \"interest\" Bae might have towards her cousin (now apparently blood-related) and... Cecilia's own flattery to the Peasant's advances? Is this another barrier for Kiara to win Cecilia's heart? Only *time* can tell.\n\nBut speaking of Time! It is Time for Kiara to enter The Chronos Dungeon. Here, their grasp of timing was put to the test. Conquering through their confusion, they soon defeated Stain King Chronos and found another treasured disc in the meanwhile. Soon another memory unfolds before them: Tammy's.\n\nA Queen she was and regal she still is. Kiara couldn't help but admire her with the rest. But there are more important matters:  The Blind Date. The responsibility felt heavy on Kiara's shoulders, she promised Gonathan and she would see the date to its hopefully successful conclusion.\n\nAh. The Knight was so consumed by the date that she forgot to report matters to the Princess! But before Kiara could finish her report, Shiori interrupted with a small concern. She spoke of the blind date between Gonathan and Calli... but Shiori was interested in Gonathan. It seems matters are [complicated](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8573).\n\n[Turmoil stirred in Kiara's noble heart.](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8832)\n\nConfounded. Concerned. Fear of ruining an already blossoming love. She called Mococo for therapy but the advice 'follow your heart' could not simply solve the dilemma Kiara inadvertently created. How could she follow her heart when its path is unclear? She would ask Mordan if she was still interested in Gonathan and... [Mordan is ready for the date](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=9226). This is the best day of my life, Mordan exclaimed, to Kiara's growing horror.\n\nAs the date began, Kiara asked Shiori to watch the blind date with her, in case the love between the other Knight and Chef was not meant to be. Was it a bright idea to invite Shiori, who was clearly interested Gonathan, to the event? The short answer is 'no'. The longer answer: Shiori would dramatically pretend to drown, interrupting the date which would led *Mordan* to dive in to save her. [It got complicated](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=9745). The Good Knight is too popular for his own good.\n\nKiara fretted as everything around her burnt. Mordan proposed to Gonathan. Shiori rescued Gonathan from the dreaded **berry bush**. The silence from Gonathan was astounding as he cried to Tammy about [his woes](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10281). In the meanwhile, Shiori and Mordan would have a [simple non-blind date](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10111) but there is no 'spark' to be found between them.\n\nBut then, it seemed well. Gonathan seemed to have made a [choice](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10733). For a moment, all is right. A ring is given to Shiori. Then, without a shred of awareness and the naivete the size of Kronii's ego, [Gonathan took the trophy and threw it on the ground](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10733). Kiara would not be privy to more as the couple decided to resolve it privately.\n\nSo caught Kiara was with the drama that she forgot to do her jobs as a hero and as a smithy, quickly selling her wares and finishing her reports to Fia. *The Outlander and The Outsider* were the same! An ill-fated hero, punished by the gods. The news broke Iphania's own heart as well. Today is a terrible day for love.\n\nBut still, Kiara went through her day. Exploring the new area and soon acquring a diamond pickaxe which was soon upgraded by Cecilia. She herself would be selling the new legendary upgrade stones at a [very affordable price](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=13082).\n\nKiara traded her legendary upgrade stones for Bijou's legendary charms, Kiara couldn't help but pour her out to a friendly ear [and, accidentally, within hearing range of the couple in question](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14507). But it seemed they did not truly hear what Kiara said as they're having a dispute of their own.\n\nAgain, mesmerised by the flames of shattering love, Kiara watched it all [unfold](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14970) and heart-wrenched that her own hand, by which she swore to defend others with, had no small part in creating this drama that ultimately ended in Gonathan's broken heart. Even after burning herself at the campfire and turning into a ghostly phoenix for a moment, Kiara agonised the course of day. Her own failed endeavors towards kind cousin, the fumbled date between Gonathan and Mordan. Perhaps, Kiara's love was to be an appreciation for life.\n\nAll this she wrote on her journal. But, even if her goals were not met, it doesn't mean that others should suffer an equally miserable day. She paid her dues to Mococo, expressed to Shiori how Kiara had misunderstood her at first and now sees the kindness in her, and [buying a significant amount of food from Fuwawa's shop](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=18238). Unperfect Kiara may be, let it be known that her kindess is unfaltering.",

            "title": "Peasant Da Bae",
            "content": "It was a brilliant morning for Peasant The Bae, a peasant with a whopping 13K gold, as she woke up to begin her day. She met others and they too would return her pleasantries, commenting on her new hat she had bought the previous day. Truly, the hearts of those around Bae as they [kindly inquire how she felt](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=428).\n\n[Peasant Partner Loan (PP)](#embed:https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=1188)\n\nBae knew what it felt like to be poor, she was coinless just a few days ago, and thought, there might be others similar to her that might be need of some coin. With this in mind, in addition to tHE dUMPSTER, PP Loans for those in need. Of course, as Bae experienced, nothing in life comes for free and the interest rates of 150% (at a variable rate) is only fair  (to be paid back within 2 business days including day of first lent). Those who don't pay back? Well, Bae can be persistent.\n\nLearning a lesson from The Gacharm's Roa, Bae would set up advertisements of her own, smartly styling each ad differently before quickly sending it out. Except to one; As a special courtesy, Peasant The Baa called the ever kind Immerkind to tell Cecilia about the newly opened PP Loan. Cecilia would receive a special rate of 100% and borrowed 1,500 gold. \n\nBae met the Hot Pink One telling her about the new service she offers. Though like alwats, the two would then gloat about their respective wealth, to up the other, and traded barbs. Bae would refute the [Hot Pink One's accusation of Bae running a scam](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=3711).\n\nSoon others would inquire about Bae's heath. Still rather worried, Gonathan and Bijou would ask a single question: If a wagon was to travel down trail but caught between two roads; in one way is a baby, who would only lived until 5, and the other had 5 elderly people, each having 1 year left to live, who would Bae choose to condemn? They fretted as Bae pondered her answer but calmed when she answered 'I would stop the wagon'. But when pushed to choose, Bae would ultimately decided to condemn the *baby* for [they have to kill a baby anyways](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=4026). As she answered, Bae entered a strange trance but seemed to return to normal.\n\nThough unsure why her friends seemed troubled, Bae turned her attention to the day's current challenge: The Chronos Dungeon. Time. Rewind. Pause. The machinations of the dungeon would confuse our heroes the previous one couldn't as they made their way through. But at last, at the end only Stain King Chronos stood in their way. Like the challenges of the dungeon itself, Time was in his grasp but it was not enough. Soon another memory, Tammy's, would unevail.\n\n[Tammy was a Queen!](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=8275) And a Time Warden, but Bae was astounded that she was in the presence of royalty all this time! But, now Bae worried - what if her own memories wouldn't be up to par? In a rare moment of comradery, IRyS echoed this sentiment. How could the Hot Pink One compare? She was drunk compared to *that*? Tammy would comfort them and reaffirm the Hot Pink One is a goddess no matter what and while it seemed that Tammy was still her same kind self, Bae gasped when Tammy, Queen Tammy, called them *plebians*. Bae may be a peasant but that is an honourable title! She got it from her mother who got it from her mother who got it from her mother. The Queen might soon turn a tyrant and turn the kingdom into a dictatorship.\n\nWith heavy hearts at their friend's change, they report back to the Princess and learnt that the ruination still spreads and the kingdom is still in danger. And as they report to Fia the cat would reveal a further upsetting news: The Outlander is the Outsider! Once The Watcher, he interfered in Libestal's fate and angered the gods (who is not IRyS). The Outsider is a true hero, only turning evil from the years of imprisonment for interfering with fate. \n\nDespite the rough events, a silver lining was found: Diamonds. Bae found her skills as a supplier only grew and the culmination of her hard work draws near...\n\n[PICK OF POWER (PP)](#embed:https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=11740)\n\nA diamond pickaxe. One maxed out to its true potential. Truly, Peasant The Bae has come so far and now her hard work has paid off. Her mother would be proud. And just like how she bears the Peasant title proudly, Bae will never forget her roots; as she finished her new axe Axe of Power (AP), she frames PP and PA in workshop. Her business would also provide this upgrade at a reasonable price, Ina being her first customer, and selling the newly found ore, Enigmatic Stones, to Bijou for a sale price. She also tried to offer her services to Queen Tammy but it seems the questionably good queen has no need of it at the moment. She would then witness [Tammy yell at the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=12995) who promptly ran away.\n\nCecilia would successfully also pay back her loan at the end of the day. The two would converse about their business and Bae advised her that Cecilia's kind prices could afford to be raised since the labour to improve such tools is rather intensive. Kiara would also offer legendary upgrade stones at a cheap price, which Bae was shocked by. She bought 2, as she had promised Gonathan to buy his wares later.\n\nJust as Bae was about to go to bed, staying up late was something Mother would have disapproved, she quickly realised that there were a few chores left to be done. She quickly called Bijou to gacha a few charms, luckily winning her gambles, and would go to buy a legendary upgrade stone Gonathan to witness the [Good Knight's Marital Troubles](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=14642). Astounded, shocked, and confused, Bae wasn't sure what to do but the time was ticking, and she was already past her bedtime, she would interrupt the drama to quickly finish the trade with Gonathan and slept for the day, unaware of how the Knight's night would end.",

The ever-delicate, always-messy realm of love—specifically, the brand of love that involved siblings, mutual friends, and being roped into playing the role of wingman whether you wanted to or not.\n\nOf course, that wouldn’t be the last therapy session of the day. In fact, love became the centerpiece of nearly every conversation the two had throughout the rest of the date. Mordon, ever the professional (in theory), claimed she was simply offering her services—nothing more. Surely, she'd never get caught up in the tangled mess her clients kept dragging into these sessions… right?\n\n[Therapy session of questionable topics](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=4AnsPPNT_wg8l5Ml&t=215)\n\nLater, she joined Tam, Nerissa, and Gonathon for the day’s main mission—investigating the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=lAhFFA_4EjWnc_FJ&t=4562).

But with prices so low it hurt. \n\n[She doesn't have a lisence](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=jllaYw_Lnzhq52cC&t=3403)\n\nBut the real twist came when the very storylines she swore to avoid started dragging her in. Remember all that messy romantic drama Gonathon kept rambling about in therapy? Yeah, Mordon suddenly found herself cast as the “destined love” in a blind date stunt cooked up by her own client—resulting in complete chaos for Gonathon’s actual crush (see [Calli-Gonathon: A Powerful Dynamic](#edge:calli-gigi)).\n\nAnd what did Mordon do after throwing the whole table into the air?\n\nShe just... left. Off to attend to other business, casually leaving the chaos in her wake.",

She had been eyeing one humble knight ever since their first encounter during a past journey, and it seemed those feelings were starting to solidify. Despite her original intentions—manipulating him for her own gain—things had changed. Somewhere along the way, she might’ve actually fallen for him.\n\nSo naturally, she started her day by infiltrating a therapy session and eavesdropping on her crush.\n\nGotta show you care, right?\n\n[Sneak 100](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=kxtX6JlJhKG0uDhE&t=668)\n\nOutside of all that, Shiori had a proper mission today like everyone else: to investigate the [Star Site: Chronos dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=lhZpQ8N-1lD_eYDy&t=2014).

Shiori, seizing the moment, dragged him off for a little one-on-one time.\n\n[Just the two of us](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=d0aIf-aCyYQrcc5X&t=5985)\n\nHe was kind, honest, and pure—everything she admired. And she knew that if she didn’t make a move soon, her chance might slip away. So, upon learning that Shakira had arranged a [blind date](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=I8E4D1s69cbSEPwP&t=6398) for Gonathon, she approached the phoenix and, in her classic tsundere manner, asked to take the mystery slot.\n\nBut that seat was already filled. Due to a major misunderstanding, Shakira had placed Mordon in the date slot, believing she had feelings for Gonathon.\n\nStill, Shiori wasn’t one to give up so easily. She had a plan: crash the date and steal Gonathon’s heart.\n\n[Ahhh! I'm drowning!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=G-v3Mv7AulkgIwP3&t=7526)\n\nBut things didn’t go how she’d hoped. Even after laying her heart bare, it all unraveled quickly (see [Shiori-Gonathon: The Witch’s Trials](#edge:gigi-shiori)).\n\nThen, as if fate herself had taken pity on the heartbroken maiden, an old acquaintance—someone once dear—approached to help ease the pain. The two shared a long, heartfelt conversation, reflecting on the bond they once shared (see [Shiori-Bijou: Severed, but still there](#edge:shiori-bijou)).\n\nShiori closed out her day by journaling everything: her hopes, her heartbreak, and her thoughts on what might lie ahead.\n\n[Hurtful, but still hopeful](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=hY1jLc2nVd9MTUO6&t=14316)",

This would last for several minutes.\n\nThis was the least of her troubles today. Far from it. In fact, the little princess was intertwined with a lot of the day’s drama. She even reconnected with a few people along the way. Especially with one she thought she wouldn’t get a chance to reconcile with.\n\nNinoIna returned after being absent from the day before. Blissfully unaware of what happened yesterday, she tried roping her sister to become one with the potato. Bijou agreed, but in turn tried to get her to become one with the bread. …To no avail. Bijou could stay in-bread though! (See [Ina-Bijou: Wooden Potato](#edge:bijou-ina)) \nSeems like not many people bought into the bread cult thing, and her sister was no exception.\n\nBefore going to Star Site: Chronos, Immerkind and Bijou went exploring to kill Stains in the second area. It’s at this point where she started calling Bijou “Chibi-hime”.\n\nReturning from the slaying session, Bijou comes across the Peasant and checks up on her mental state with that Stain hat on… [It doesn’t look too good for her.](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=4287)\n\nThe Peasant’s memories were failing her? Is the Corruption at risk of spreading here too? She felt the need to speak with someone about this. Having discussed this matter with Gonathan earlier, she immediately called him up. She discovered that she was in the middle of a therapy session with Mordan Ramsey; she didn’t care and butted in like a kid getting an adult’s attention.\n\nMordan offered to give her two cents, but only after Bijou paid 100 coins (which she agreed upon as long as she got a snack from her—again, very child-like). The reaper suggests they try tricking the Peasant into giving up that cursed hat somehow in a trade. If that doesn’t work, Calli would gladly take her into The Basement to forcibly take it off.\n\nSpeaking of The Basement, Bijou wanted to finally see it for herself, as part of her therapy. She would NEARLY get inducted into The Wolf Pack… if only she wasn’t an in-bread. Regardless, Gonathan agreed to fight the corruption alongside her, should the need arise.\n\n[Couples’ Therapy with Gonathan](#embed:https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=4396)\n\nAs if nothing happened preceding, Gonathan joined forces with Bijou to revisit the Stronghold of Ruin, helping Ina, Fuwawa, and Mococo out going through it for the first time. \n\nShe would later join IRyS, Immerkind, Kiara, and Ina to investigate the day’s dungeon, Star Site: Chronos. It was there where they would recover the memories of Tam Gandr, or Ouro Kronii. With her memories restored, everyone returned from the dungeon worshipping her. In the midst of it all, Princess Bijou blurted, “Does that make you my mom?” (see [Bijou-Kronii: Not Again...](#edge:bijou-kronii))\n\nFollowing the dungeon, Bijou immediately sets out to find new materials for the best charms—Legendary Charms using Enigmatic Stones that kind of look like the gem on her chest. Perhaps it was fate that she became a Jeweler after all. \n\nBack at Gacharms, Kiara would visit to fulfil their trade relationship, patiently waiting in line for Bae to finish her pulls. She would end up [spilling tea](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=18313) to Bijou about a blind date he put Gonathan and Mordan on. It fell apart after she realized at the last moment that Gonathon had fallen for Shiori instead, who *appeared during said date…* causing a chain reaction.\n\nThey suddenly started hearing voices above them… It was Gonathan and Shiori on the roof. Unbeknownst to Kiara and Bijou, there was *already* an update to Kiara’s gossip that had transpired during her entire talk. Bijou was fine letting Gonathan and Shiori continue to use the roof of the shop. The interaction that ensued on the roof set off its own chain reaction caused by a misunderstanding, and eventually… a divorce (see [Gigi-Shiori: The Witch’s Trials](#edge:gigi-shiori)).\n\nSeveral people watched the breakup happen before their eyes, behind the glass windows of Shiori’s house. Bijou couldn’t help feeling sad seeing Shiori cry, so she came to her side soon after. She took this opportunity to reconcile with her past and get back with her. She wanted to mend Shiori’s twice-broken heart. She also felt bad about abandoning their child Khaos and vowed to bring him back (see [Bijou-Shiori: Severed, but still there](#edge:shiori-bijou)).\n\nNow Bijou has double the motivation for what she vented about to Mordan and Gonathan. There was a moral need to get the Peasant to give up that Stain hat. This would ultimately be for everyone’s sake… but especially her own, to fix her relationship with Shiori. It's not just a (cursed) hat; it was her child. Their child. How she’ll do it… is a problem for another time.\n\nShe spent the rest of the day gathering materials, all the while pondering if she should confess to Gonathan about her feelings about Shiori. He had forgotten all about their previous adventure in the illusory version of Libestal. She figured that she didn’t want Gonathan to feel bad about taking her girl, so she had to say *something* about it.\n\nThey both agreed to meet back at Gacharm, and it’s there where Bijou confessed about her rekindled love for Shiori. The entire truth came out, and Gonathan seemed to be understanding, despite looking troubled and pacing around in place.\n\n[“...We were, in fact, betrothed.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=21191)\n\nBijou was the last one around for the day, working overtime to make sure the shop was ready for the next day. Nobody would be around to hear her practice [howling… “like a pup”](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=22518). She may have more than that dawg in her after all.\n\nShe also left exactly [8008 coins](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=23011) in her pocket. Just for laughs. We all needed it after what had transpired this day; herself and the voices in her head. [Maybe Fuwawa could smile a bit too.](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=22932)\n\n[“JOURNAL DAY 4”](#embed:https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=23356)",

            "content": "**The Humble Fumbler**\n\nAs the sun rose on day four, no one could foresee the maelstrom of turmoil and tragedy that would engulf Gonathon and those closest to him. The day begin simply enough, with the humble knight visiting Gacharms to acquire new equipment. Chief on Gonathon’s mind was the suspected corruption of Peasant the Bae, which soon extended to Princess Bijou upon learning of her past corruption (see [Bijou-Gonathon: A Rock and a Hard Place](#edge:gigi-bijou)). These concerns had to be set aside, as an encounter with Immerkind led to Gonathon becoming once again conflicted of the [role](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=21m13s) he had played in Immerkind’s delusional pursual of the Princess. (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Kind and the Humble Knight](#edge:cecilia-gigi))\n\nHis search for solace led him to Mordan Ramsey who, after some haggling, agreed to become Gonathon’s therapist (see [Mordan-Gonathon: A Powerful Dynamic](#edge:calli-gigi)). It was during their discussions that Mordan revealed that not only was the [Pearl](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=1h23m45s) someone very close to Gonathon, but was in fact his former lover who had since disappeared.\n\n[I was called…a diamond…](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h17m53s)\n\nGonathon had little time to ponder these revelations, as he joined Tam Gandr, Nerissa, and Mordan in tackling the next dungeon, [Star Site: Chronos](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=1h44m14s). The puzzles and boss proved to be formidable challenge, but they paled in comparison to what came next. Upon the Stain King’s fall, a flood of memories returned to Gonathon: that Tam Gandr was in fact the Queen of Libestal from their timeline and a powerful Time Warden. Returning to Libestal, Tam and Gonathon shared a heartfelt reunion, with both affirming their ironclad bond and Gonathon pledging to stand by Tam no matter what (see [Gonathon-Kronii: The Queen’s Gambit](#edge:kronii-gigi)).\n\n[You will always be my queen!](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=2h43m48s)\n\nFrom here things took a turn for the dramatic, with Shiori of the Nyavellas at the center of it all (see [Gonathon-Shiori: Trials of the Witch](#edge:gigi-shiori)). For while Gonathon and Shiori's newfound love was still just beginning to blossom, this love would be stretched all the way to the breaking point. For the destined blind date set up by Shakira finally occurred, with [Gonathon’s date being none other than Mordan Ramsey!](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h11m48s) Things only got worse as Shiori, seeking to observe the date, began to drown and had to be saved by Mordan. As the two rivals for Gonathon’s affection started to quarrel, the hapless knight couldn’t take the pressure and fled. It was here that Gonathon’s lack of decisiveness and blind loyalty reared its ugly head, as the knight begged for Tam Gandr to not only provide advice, but also to [directly observe and live with him and Shiori as a way of preventing any misdeeds on his part.](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h28m55s)\n\n[Devote yourself to me…no matter the consequences](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h51m2s)\n\nWhile Tam agreed to assist, all of this was too much for Shiori. She decided to test Gonathon to prove his devotion, and eventually formed a soul pact with him and they briefly became husband and wife. A meeting with Immerkind led to some more [words of wisdom](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h23m50s) from the green wolf: That even if Gonathon’s memories were not the same as they were in the past, that deep down Gonathon was still the same person. The two wolves vowed to escape this timeline together, their bond stronger than ever.\n\n[Love is when you spend time together and laugh!](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h19m42s)\n\nAlas, none of this was enough to overcome Gonathon’s crippling dedication to his queen and inability to make his own decisions. For upon returning home, Gonathon encountered what seemed to be a startling scene: [Tam Gandr and Shiori engaging in an affair!](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h31m02s) But rather than seek answers from the two, the bumbling knight chose to once again flee, an act which, along with Shiori [falling to her death](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h36m00s) while trying to explain to Gonathon, completely broke the battered witch and led to her ending her romance with Gonathon.\n\nDevastated and overcome with regret, Gonathon’s final moments of the day were spent being consoled by Tam Gandr. The queen urged Gonathon to think carefully about his feelings and who he truly loved. But despite all of these misfortunes and frustration that Gonathon had inflicted on himself and others, Tam remained committed to Gonathon, and the two [parted on hopeful terms](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=5h6m45s). For hope was now something that Gonathon needed more than anything, and in his daily journal he once again reflected on those that he loved and had loved. He ended by expressing a desire to make tomorrow a better day. Godspeed, Gonathon G.\n\n[Writing his daily journal](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=5h28m35s)",

That was the theme of the dungeon, made clear from the moment they stepped inside. Day and night flickered like a faulty lantern, sky shifting with every step. The trials? All timed. Every challenge ticking down ominously, each misstep shaving away precious seconds. Even the puzzles, though unforgiving, could be reset—*rewound*, as if the dungeon itself bent to the flow of time.

A cold, dictatorial overlord (see [Kronii-IRyS: Tyrannical Ruler](#edge:irys-kronii)).\n\n* Speaking of the green one—Immerkind, obsessed with the Princess as always—nearly jumped off the deep end, and Kronii had to drag her back from the edge (see [Kronii-Immerkind: Drinks between Queen and Knight](#edge:cecilia-kronii)).\n\n* Geting dragged into adopting someone else's once daughter (see [Kronii-Bijou: Not Again...](#edge:bijou-kronii))\n\n* And to top it all off, Gonathon G, her ever-loyal servant, was in the middle of a love fiasco that she somehow got [blamed for](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=52HWNzLYw1YlgPp8&t=10344).

Unfortunately for Gonathon G., her inability to reconcile the love for her queen and the love for her newfound companion would inevitably lead to heartbreak. \n\nFollowing her return from Star Site: Chronos and the reaffirmation of her role as Tam Gandr’s loyal knight (see [Kronii-Gonathon: The Queen’s Gambit](#edge:kronii-gigi)), Gonathon began to feel conflicted over whether it was right for her to seek love while in the queen’s service. Dismissing these thoughts for the time being, Gonathon assured Shiori that the [strong affinity](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=2h50m6s) they had still endured, and Shiori in turn gifted Gonathon with a ring, further cementing their bond. \n\n[What if when my memories return I am not who I am?](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=2h52m33s)\n\nThese tender moments would not last long, as soon after Gonathon was called by Shakira to the destined blind date she had arranged with “the one who was perfected for Gonathon.” This was not Shiori however, but [Mordan Ramsey](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h11m48s) Gonathon’s fellow wolf and new therapist. Shiori, keen to keep an eye on Gonathon, snuck up on the date and began quarrelling over Gonathon’s heart with the pink therapist. This resulted in the first of Gonathon’s many fumbles, as the hapless knight chose to [flee and seek direction from Tam Gandr](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h18m18s) rather than address the issue herself. \n\nUpon Gonathon’s return, Shiori expressed her reservation about the knight’s commitment. Indulging in her more manipulative and wily side, the witch announced that she was going to require Gonathon to [prove her devotion](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h39m36s) which included finishing the roof of her house and for the knight to swear to do anything Shiori asked for. While Gonathon was more than willing to accept, the knight had requirements of her own: that Tam Gandr live with them for at least a year and observe their relationship for any signs of misconduct. Reluctantly agreeing to these terms, the two held pinkies before briefly parting ways. \n\n[Devote yourself to me…no matter the consequences](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h51m2s)\n\nUnfortunately, it was here that their budding romance was savagely nipped. For upon returning to her home, Gonathon found her queen and her wife seemingly engaged in an [affair](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h31m02s) on their bunk bed. Unwilling to wait for an explanation, the distraught knight fled, with Shiori in hot pursuit. Alas, the witch slipped and fell to her death, which deeply shocked Gonathon. The worst was yet to come, for Shiori accused Gonathon of pushing her to her demise, and it was this final act that served as the catalyst for the witch severing their romance for good. \n\nAny hopes Gonathon had of redeeming herself in Shiori’s eyes were quickly dashed, as Koseki Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Rock and a Hard Place](#edge:gigi-bijou) explained to Gonathon that she had rekindled her past romance with Shiori, one that the gem was keen to not see break again. And thus, Gonathon’s second foray into love ended in tragedy. It remains to be seen if the humble knight has learned anything from this heartbreak, as it is lessons like these that will be needed in the days ahead.",

This was quickly interrupted by a gaggle of peasants who, having witnessed Tam’s power in the memory, were now seeking to get into her good graces. This sycophancy was short-lived, as the Breads soon attempted to spark a coup to depose Tam. Immediately rushing to her side, Gonathon reassured Tam that she would always support her, which deeply moved Tam.\n\n[You will always be my queen!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/BSPi8sTHdAY?si=k33dxJgsRB5jPFyu&t=9770)\n\nThe darker side of their bond soon reared its ugly head, as Gonathon’s memories of Tam included a supposed Pact of Celibacy she had taken, which flew straight in the face of her burgeoning relationship with Shiori of the Nyavellas (see [Gonathon-Shiori: Trials of the Witch](#edge:gigi-shiori)). Now deeply conflicted, Gonathon would call on Tam several times to provide guidance and permission. This included intervention in a quarrel between Mordan Ramsey and Shiori following a blind date gone wrong and came to a head when Gonathon requested that Tam not only supervise her relationship with Shiori, but live with them on the top bunk for at least a year. Unwilling to lose her most treasured and only knight, Tam agreed to the [proposal](https://www.youtube.com/live/BSPi8sTHdAY?si=GZzaSx6FFBlTbIpm&t=12615). \n\nDespite Tam’s best (and worst) efforts, a critical misunderstanding shattered Shiori and Gonathon’s relationship: as she was inspecting the sleeping arrangements with Shiori, a hapless Gonathon witnessed what appeared to be an affair between the two and fled. This led to Shiori giving chase and falling to her death, an action which caused her to break off her romance with Gonathon. \n\nIn spite of all of this turmoil, Tam and Gonathon remained committed to one another, with Tam consoling Gonathon and confronting her about her relationship with Mordan Ramsey and Gonathon telling Tam of the wondrous statue the knight had built for her in the future. In a day filled with darkness and grief, the queen’s return was one of the sole shining lights for the knight, but it remains to be seen whether this bond will endure.",

Romance and drama continued to dominate the kingdom like an ever-thickening fog, only now it was messier, weirder, and tangled beyond belief.\n\nBefore diving into the chaos, the heroes took on what might be the final major dungeon: Star Site: Chaos. And true to its name, it was exactly that—chaotic. Unlike the previous dungeons, which had grand themes and solemn trials, this one felt more like a playground of silliness. \n\nPuzzles? More like party games. Deep concepts? Nah, just fun. And of course, luck was a major player—so even if the heroes performed flawlessly, they still had to pray the stars were on their side.\n\n![The heroes battling Stain King: Chaos](/images-opt/chaos.webp)\n\nNow, onto the real madness. Gonathon kind of redeemed himself. Shiori and Bijou reconnected. Elizabeth and Nerissa continued their little flirt-fest. Bijou and Bae ended up in a legal custody battle over their child. Tam, Roa, and the hot pink lady spiraled into a love triangle—with the pink one somehow claiming she was pregnant. And all the mentally scarred adventurers? They booked a session with Mordan the therapist… who promptly quit her job after realizing what she had to deal with.\n\n![Mordan’s therapy session](/images-opt/therapy.webp)\n\nYou following all that?

She was greeted by [Roa and Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=490s)  —friendly morning hellos, headpats exchanged—until the blue bird lady popped in, completely ruining the mood (or more accurately, ruining Elizabeth’s ability to keep her composure).\n\nWith actual people around her this time—unlike the solitude of the day before—Elizabeth joined the gang to tackle the Star Site: Chronos dungeon. Upon completion, she recovered memories of Ouro Kronii and came to a simple yet powerful realization: having others around really did make all the [difference](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=6644s).\n\nNext came the Star Site: Chaos dungeon, presumably one of the last major ones and a particularly intriguing one, where the aspect of chance dictated the flow. Still, alongside Bijou, Shiori, and Nerissa, Elizabeth powered through and recovered the memories of [Hakos Baelz](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?si=1zrJ9s4OAUQLt_pm&t=9740).\n\nThen came a true test of strength and courage. The Outlander challenged Elizabeth to a duel—a trial to determine if the heroes were worthy of carrying the fate of the world. Though she stumbled a few times, Elizabeth held her ground and proved her worth.\n\nWith all the main tasks out of the way, the day slowly descended into madness. It started with a heartfelt conversation with [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=13255s), but somehow everything spiraled and the spotlight shifted to Nerissa. Even the gods themselves chimed in, calling out to Elizabeth to “give Nerissa a chance,” all due to a supposed misunderstanding that unfolded earlier in the day (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: No Room for Drama](#edge:liz-nerissa)). The cape of wisdom also made a return.\n\nOnce the chaos subsided, Elizabeth wound down, penned a letter to Shakira expressing her appreciation, and finally called it a day.",

            "content": "The events of yesterday lingered in Kiara's mind and it is with concern that Kiara asked Mordan for a private word. Underneath the Chef's Tavern, Kiara [inquired about Mordan's well-being](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=836); the blind-date had ended horribly for everyone, but especially for her fellow wolf. Mordan reassured her, that though she liked Gonathan, she would prioritised Gonathan's feelings. But seeing the way Mordan put aside her own feelings, seemingly burying it within, made Kiara concerned.\n\nIn the midst of their talk, Elizabeth, Kiara's Sugar Child, would come by to request a legendary upgrade stone - Kiara quickly provided and was delighted to guess that it was a gift meant for a [certain Raven](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1045) as the other woman would frequently leave gifts for Elizabeth. Elizabeth, flustered but didn't deny, left. \n\nThe conversation then turned to Gonathan and Mordan's attempts, as Gonathan's therapist, on helping the Good Knight remember his past - [to remember His Pearl](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1128) in order to lead him to the right direction. That a new love isn't what Gonathan needs, but companionship of others. Kiara wondered if Mordan was projecting her own feelings as she too felt that recently.\n\nKiara went back to her forge to see Nerissa bought something earlier. Elizabeth commented her surprise as she remembered Nerissa complained of being poor to which Kiara would playfully disagree; especially if one would compare Nerissa's wealth compares to Elizabeth's own. As her Sugar Matron, Kiara would [give money](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1419) to the other's thankful embarrassment. Kiara would also come across a rather [pretty pink panther](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1535) whom she would promise to go to the new dungeon later. \n\n[A Comrade remembering...](#embed:https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1587)\n\nAnd it seem Roa might remember something. Kiara of course knew they were part of the same guild before, but could it be a sign? Would her friend would remember their treasured bonds?\n\nKiara left for the newer Remnant fields to search for materials and the new Enigmatic Stones, commenting on the mysteriousness of the material compared to the more common ores. She met Mordan again, the Lorekeepers fighting together against the Stains before shortly, finding what seems to be [a grave for one called \"Anax\"](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=4045). A journal left on the grave revealed a tragic tale. \n\nAt the job hall, Kiara would meet Ina ask if she had received Kiara's letter. She did! [Ina would read out loud](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=4856). An apology for the slight yesterday and Ina would wave it off stating all is good, giving a potato as thanks.\n\nBy the wagon, Kiara found [Roa in a trance](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=5592). Perhaps a vision, one of Time, is coming back to her? While waiting for Roa to awaken, Kiara overhear Shiori's complaining to Nerissa, guessing it was about Gonathan. [Kiara could fix Shiori.](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=5673) Roa reawakens and Kiara would let her know they have found a group for the dungeon.\n\nBut it seems, it is not only Kiara and Shiori that are affected by the relationship Drama. Kiara would comfort Gonathan when [he overheard others were gossiping.](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=6300)\n\nAnd soon, the hour comes again, a new dungeon to dive, one with Chaos as its name. And Chaos it is, for though the challenges are simple in nature, they aren't in effort. More party games than fights, eventually the group would encounter the Boss, and as before, win the battle. Though... something's missed as luck was not on their side as they lucked out on the treasured disc.\n\nA chaotic memory unfolds: The Peasant The Bae's! Kiara likened the memory to her own, [fun and sillier to the memory's before](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=8602). Another connection would be how they helped others in simpler but still meaningful ways.\n\n\nBut it seems the fight is not over. As she reported to the Princess, the Outlander returned, and soon, his history - and fate - revealed. Now, [Kiara would prove her worth as a Knight and Hero](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=9733) against the Outlander, finishing the battle in her flaming Revelation. Now it seemed history shall diverge and the Outlander's fate may have finally been changed. She left the Princess and Outlander to alone, but before she does, A few questions would be asked:\n\n[*What Does Libestal Mean to You?* **TO SAVE THE LESBIANS!**](#embed:https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=9949)\n\nKiara noticed her fellow knight's struggle against the Outlander fight and offered to give her some equipment to help in the battle, [fulfilling that promise](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=10623) shortly after it was made. As she went to her forge, Nerissa passed by to see if there were legendary upgrade stones. Pleased by the earnings of the day, she would see to restock her wares.\n\nElizabeth then returned in [victory](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11357)! Besting the Outlander, totally on the first try of course. Kiara felt proud at Elizabeth's progressed. The Red Knight was already strong and to see her stronger was to be admired. \n\nBut unfortunately, a strength that caused a tense situation: [Knight Bloodflame would suddenly attack Nerissa, calling her a witch,](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11940) when the latter came by to see Elizabeth. Kiara quickly pulled Nerissa aside and [reassured her](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11984) that it is not Elizabeth's true feelings and there is fondness within the Red Knight's heart for the Blue Chef. Time is what Elizabeth needs. Kiara promised to wingman but... carefully this time.\n\nToday was a calmer day and perhaps tomorrow would be a nice day off.",

            "content": "\"Something is... *stirring*,\" The Peasant The Bae thought. From where, she couldn't say. The child that is on her head? Inside her? Perhaps it is that. Visions, snapshots of a [face she almost grasped](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=824) but slipped through her fingers. Today would be a special one.\n\nThat is not the only thing Bae worried about. She called Gonathan to her PP Hole, to inquire about his well-being from yesterday's rather dramatic (love) affair and to ask for his advice. To Bae's relief, Gonathan seemed to be doing better and she would open her own heart: She is but a peasant, dumb (and poor) in many ways but especially in the matters of the heart. Her Mother never finished this lesson but ignorance did not stop her heart from stirring whenever she met the kind Immerkind. \n\n[A Peasant's Heart for One with a Kind Heart](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=1318)\n\nBae felt anguish as she knew [Immerkind's love for the Princess Iphania](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=1388), for how could a peasant, even one with more money, compare to royalty? Is this love?  Confused, Bae asked Gonathan for his advice. Gonathan hesitated, his own endeavour with love had proven... Complicated (See Gonathan's relationships), but, reminded Bae that she was there for Immerkind when others were not. Perhaps write a letter, he suggested, so Immerkind may read Bae's true feelings once she returns?\n\nGonathan brought up another point Bae hadn't consider: They are heroes of another land. Once their adventure is over, they *must* leave Libestal. What of Immerkind's heart then, when she would have to part ways with the Princess. Realising that perhaps that a lowly peasant might have a chance, Bae quickly took his advice and began fretting on what to write in her letter. Gonathan advised Bae to write what she told him, for what her heart spoke is what she felt and that is enough. A gift too wouldn't be a bad idea.\n\n[A letter and A 5000 gold Bouquet](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=1762)\n\nEmpowered, Bae quickly bought a letter to send but pondered on the gift. A ring, especially an expensive one, might prove too much, too soon. Flowers are a better option but which one? Bae faltered. 5000 gold for a bouquet of roses? Bae's love for Immerkind overcame her newly found appreciation for money and she bought the bouquet, swearing to swiftly earn the money back which came rather quick when Mordan Ramsey called Bae to commission a diamond pickaxe for 4000 gold.\n\nStill, Bae worried for what [comes after the Dungeon](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2262). The trepidatious feelings came back. Tammy once kind is now a Tyrant Queen calling them all 'peasants'. If Peasant The Bae's memories returned, would her feelings stay the same? It was letter best written before the adventure, to preserve her feelings on paper.\n\n[Dearest ImmerKind...](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2543)\n\nHer passion and love for Immerkind burnt like a thousand suns as she tenderly wrote on the parchment. Words flowed out like a steady river but soon found itself overflowing into the ocean as droplets of water flew into the sky like stars. Soon, the letter was done but was it good enough? She asked Gonathan and a few others to proofread the letter and was [gladdened by the positive reception](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3130), the Hot Pink One's notwithstanding by her rating of 6/10. \n\nThings are looking up, her letter approved and roses ready, when Bijou called. She first inquired about purchasing Enigmatic Stones and would quickly ask if they can negotiate in-person. Bae quickly agreed but then would come to slightly regret that decision; In the PP hole, Bijou revealed she remembered her past memories and... \n\n[The 'hat' on Bae's head is her's and Shiori's child, Khaos.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3580)\n\nBijou would quickly explain her past, her mistake, and of Shiori's inability to care for Khaos alone led to the child being abandoned before being picked up by Bae and then [ultimately asking for Khaos back to make amends with Shiori](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3620), to Ina's and the Hot Pink One's shock and Bae's disgust. Anger coursed through Bae as she told Bijou how she found Khaos alone, how **she** was the one who truly cared for her when no one else was there. This conversation would ultimately turn to Mordan's therapy since there is not Court available for the heroes to use.\n\n... After conquering the next dungeon, Star Site: Chaos. A dungeon that... **spoke** to Bae. There was an [overwhelming sense of familiarity with each challenge](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=4434). Each game was *beautifully chaotic*. There was no need for challenging puzzles or math questions, no need to prove your overwhelming might. Just enough luck to get a nice roll on a die.\n\n[**WAAAAZZZZUUUUUPPPP**](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSFZwinYaaU)\n\nBae wasn't a peasant - she helped out *peasants*, like Charlie! That brat, he took her dice and she can't really use her full powers now. Bae might need therapy later since there was much to unpack. But, despite her newly found identity, Bae would still be a [Peasant in Charlie's honour!](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=5680) \n\nBut all is not over, the Outlander found the source of Ruination in the Heart of the Ruins and then soon found out that unfortunate fate that will befall him if saves the world. He doubted her strength but Bae proved [her strength is more than enough to take his place](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6108). Another tender moment would be had as [Bae witnessed Fia's final memory return to her](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6316).\n\nThe adventure might be done but Bae's day isn't over as she completed Mordan's request for a diamond pickaxe, quickly calling the Chef for her services as a therapist for the family dispute. Bae would wistfully remember Charlie as she worked, remembering memories from long ago. [But, then who was Mother?](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6505). Was Mother real? Or was perhaps Mother... Brother? Was 'Brother' Charlie? Bae couldn't understand why her memories were so conflicted.\n\nA feeling that would ironically be mirrored in Bijou as the princess would call Bae for help; [Shiori, Bijou's beloved, and Gonathan were talking once again](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=10880) and Bijou must respect their privacy. Her distrust of Shiori in the past had led to her mistakes, ones that must not be repeated. Though the custody of Khaos was still in dispute, Bae was still Bijou's friend and loyal customer, receiving splendid charms earlier, and affirmed that Bijou should trust Shiori. Seeing that Bijou was still in conflict, Bae immediately suggested to counselling since Mordan's free.\n\nBae would quickly go to Mordan's therapy and had a brief solo therapy. After explaining her side of the story, including the spicy drama of the current state of the Shiori-Bijou relationship, Mordan would explain her idea: to trick the couple with a fake child. Bae disagreed Bijou would be tricked but had another idea. [She bought another hat/child](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11383) and [renamed the real Khaos](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11464).

Bijou would waived all her rights as parental rights to Khaos and Gonathan would step up to support the child, despite being an outsider to this family dispute, and all of the party involved, minus the Good Knight Gonathan for he is still part of Mordan's Pack and too kind, would turn and blame the innocent Tavern-owning Therapist Chef for their heated dispute.\n\n[Bae is also Mother to another child.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13027)\n\nBijou and Bae would make [amends in Shiori's shack](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13039) and admit they are all family now as Khaos played by the carpet and the second child playing by the bed. Expressing they all want everyone to be happy. Bae giving her blessing for Bijou to visit Khaos from time to time. The same offer of visitation would also be extended for Shiori. Gonathan was there as well and so was included and [would pay for child support](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13387).\n\nGonathan would pull Bae away to talk to her privately in the PP hole where Bae would explain that perhaps her memories are linked to her missing box. Conversation would then turn to Immerkind, Bae explaining that she would send the letter [in front Cecilia](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13807) so she can present her flowers after Cecilia finished reading. Gonathan promised to wingman for Bae when the morrow comes.\n\nShe would also need to build a safe room for her *children* but that is a quest for another day.",

Reader discretion is advised.)**\n\nToday was the day Princess Bijou wanted to set things straight.\n\nShe had awoken from the bed of her beloved. It was the first night of restful sleep she had in a span of four days; she either slept on the floor of her shop or collapsed (like that one time at the end of Day 2). \n\nShe went back to her shop, where she found the story she commissioned from her dearly beloved! Hidden in a corner, [she read it out loud.](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=515)\n\nIt was only 10 pages long like she asked, but… it ended on a cliffhanger! She desperately wanted to see what would happen next. Luckily, Shiori just got on, so she was able to ask for a sequel then and there.\n\nShe also invited Shiori to go to Star Site: Chronos together, knowing her boss was absent yesterday and had yet to see it. Shiori had to get ~~dinner~~ breakfast first AND was anticipating some sort of meeting with the other Chefs in a few minutes, so they put a pin on that.\n\nSpeaking of her boss, Roa came back today after a well-deserved day off. Elizabeth, the Red Knight, came by the shop during this time and… it seems like [Roa had the hots for her?](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=3401) \n\nBijou tried to push her towards making a move, and it seems like she did—although she made it anonymous. A secret admirer sort of situation. Whatever happened after that… wasn’t Bijou’s problem at that point.\n\n----\n\nAfter her revisit to Star Site: Chronos, [she called up Peasant Bae](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=7980), asking for materials for her shop as she ran out after serving Gonathan. This was how Bijou decided to bait her into trying to get Khaos back…\n\nVeiled behind a regular business transaction, Bijou confronts the Peasant about the Stain hat on her head. She and Shiori had previously abandoned the baby back in the illusory Libestal, and now she wants it back.\n\n(*NOTE: [Biboo clarified outside of RP](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=25370) that Khaos is the stain hat that Shiori wore last chapter. The stain hat that Bijou got corrupted by went away after she got purified.*)\n\nBae strongly believed she had been taking better care of Khaos since she found it; after all, Bae did the right thing to free them from the shackles of slavery. *(How it traveled back in time with the warriors is…not explained.)* \n\n[The hat is not for sale.](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=8082)\n\nAs if her Onii-chan and her sister openly eavesdropping on this wasn’t enough, Bijou tried getting Tam’s opinion on the matter. …It was too early for the queen to deal with it. The two will just have to settle it in therapy later.\n\nThat said, they would have to set their differences aside for the time being. It was time for Bijou to investigate Star Site: Chaos.\n\n----\n\nLittle did she know that she would be asked to duel with none other than [The Outlander](#node:outlander) upon her return, as a test of her strength for what's to come.\n\nThey were transported to a [vaguely familiar place](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=11300) to fight. Bijou was victorious, winning on the first try. Somehow she could be reached by phone in that mysterious battlefield, but that didn't distract her from fighting.\n\nThe dialogue she had with the Princess and the Outlander after the duel had Bijou pause to think deeply for a moment. Although she was being asked about the fate of Libestal, she couldn’t just think of that when asked this one question:\n\n[“What does Libestal mean to you?”](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=11473)\n\n----\n\nBijou met with Gonathan at the Library after recovering [Fia’s](#node:fia) third memory fragment. [Gonathan soon asked for Bijou’s ear](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=11846) in regards to a serious matter.\n\nSat under a big tree far from everyone else’s buildings, he felt the need to confess about eavesdropping on the conversation she had with Bae earlier.\n\nGonathan realized how much Bijou likes Shiori. If there was anything he could do to help Bijou get the baby back, he was but one call away. (See [Bijou-Gonathan: Good Neighbors](#edge:gigi-bijou).) In response, she invited Gonathan to join her therapy session with Bae.\n\nBae was waiting at the wagon, now having reclaimed her memories as Hakos Baelz (she was still a peasant at heart). She postponed her therapy session until after she revisited Star Site: Chaos. With Bijou, Gonathan, and Ina, they tried winning the hidden music disc a second time.\n\nThey all failed the first time in their respective parties; Bijou’s party ended with 53% luck. In that second attempt, with a 9-in-10 chance, they were successful! \n\nThey ran to the nearest jukebox to celebrate…to the Hot Pink One’s chagrin at first, as they went straight to *his* jukebox first.\n\n[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, PLAY DICE!](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=13505)\n\nThat was the peak of Bijou’s happiness that day. The calm before the storm, if you will. The events that would later transpire would become traumatic to innocent Princess Bijou…\n\n----\n\nAs she approached Shiori’s house, she saw Gonathan at her front door. She wanted to ask Shiori to come to couples’ therapy, but she innocently let him go inside and let the two talk things out first. She [hid inside the outhouse](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15243) to eavesdrop on them for a bit. Apparently Shiori had cooked a meal for Gonathan?!\n\nAt some point [she felt guilty](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15366) about eavesdropping. She didn’t wanna be blinded by jealousy and rage once again. Her trust in both of them stayed true. If they felt the need to talk things out, that’s their business. She even [called Bae](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15485), out of not having nobody else to turn to.\n\nBijou decided to postpone the therapy session a little bit longer. She wanted to see Shiori anyway. Feigning ignorance, she entered Shiori’s house. Gonathan appeared to be coming back in; he was wearing a Chef’s Touque.\n\nShiori was kind enough to let her in and feed her. The first thing Bijou brought up was the child, and what Shiori’s opinion on the matter was.\n\nShiori was very frank about her feelings. [If the child is happy, she’s willing to support from afar.](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15866) The best course of action seemed to just let Bae have the child… unless Bijou objects.\n\nBijou wasn’t entirely satisfied by this answer. She was pursuing this for Shiori’s sake. Her stance did not change, but… agreed to come to the therapy session.\n\nIn essence, this was now a family therapy session.\n\n----\n\nAlone, Bijou went to Mordan’s therapy shack to begin therapy. She stated her case, only for Bae to suddenly butt in and object. Shiori and Gonathan soon followed, and the court case truly began.\n\n[Family Court](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15988)\n\nGonathan was kind of just… there though. This was mainly an affair between Bijou, Shiori, and Bae. Gonathan looked confused almost the entire time and nay spoke a word… even though he paid to be there.\n\nNonetheless, there was a lot of yelling back and forth. Poor Princess Bijou felt overwhelmed by this entire exchange and emotions got the best of her. She couldn’t even see the fact that the Stain on Bae’s head [wasn’t actually her child!](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=16677) Bae  was also the mother of another child all along...\n\nMordan closed the case as follows: [Shiori](#node:shiori) can have visitation rights, but Bijou must offer child support. Bijou then brought up living space concerns, stating that the diamond-studded room in Bae’s hole was too small and thus inadequate.\n\nWhile looking for an adequate living space for the child, Mordan began to lose her composure. She [talked under her breath](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17200) towards Shiori; they had a bad relationship from day one in Past Libestal. Unfortunately, everyone heard that and were all shook by this. Even Shiori—they were still in a therapy session!\n\nThe five of them tried to reconcile—which Bijou partially helped in by agreeing to pay for the [charges](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17403) put against her by Bae. “Call it child support”, said Shiori. \n\nAll seemed to be well… but it somehow got worse. Overwhelmed in anger, Mordan ran away and left for the day. They were all out of a therapist.\n\nBijou felt the need to talk to Bae after the entire fiasco. [Things went out of hand](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17644) and they knew that. The better course of action is just to talk it out. As a family.\n\nShiori seemed to be off finding Gonathan again. Bae had let the children play in Shiori’s room for the time being. As part of their reconciliation, Bae mutually agreed to give Bijou visitation rights after all (alongside Shiori).\n\nThe two of them came back to Gonathon and Shiori, [reconciling](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17898) as a group on their own terms. Mordan was now seen in a new light. Were her services biased after all? Whatever happened to impartiality? And what of privacy, for that matter?\n\nMaybe they’ll seek different avenues of therapy the next day. That jeweler Mococo offers therapy sessions too, after all…\n\nAfter all of that, Bijou asked where she stood with Shiori regarding their relationship. They mutually agreed to let Bae have the child, and Bae allowed them to visit whenever they pleased. All was well.\n\n[…But what will come of the two of them?](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=18552)\n\n----\n\nAs if the day was over, the two of them [wrote their daily journals](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=19395) together inside the therapist shack. But… the day’s tension was not over. \n\nAs the two were about to submit their daily journals to the library, they walked into Tam and IRyS. The queen was confessing her love to IRyS. Bijou sees this all go down from a distance, not even thinking at first to go to her brother’s side.\n\nGonathan had also finished his daily journal around this time and walked in on this, only to get turned away by Shiori. No matter… Gonathon had seen enough. Shiori demanded Gonathan to sit in the therapy chair until they cleared out.\n\nShiori and Bijou returned to the inside of the library. She continued to distance herself from the matter, but… wait—IRyS is EXPECTING?! Hearing what Tam and IRyS were saying… the Princess started to spiral too.\n\n[\"Is no person in this kingdom good?!\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=20720)\n\nTo try bringing comedic relief to the situation, Bijou asks to make sure if it’s just gas she is feeling. Then again, if it was real, then maybe a [gender reveal party](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=20922) is to be called for. Shiori could easily provide for that.\n\nBijou had to speak to someone about this though. Now without a therapist, [Shiori lends both her and Gonathan her ear](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21122)—promising to be completely unbiased. Unlike that reaper/lorekeeper/tavern keeper guy…\n\nThis was mainly Gonathon’s time to speak his mind about what he felt. Bijou had also given her two cents on the matter, coming from her blood-pact relation to IRyS. She leaves Shiori and Gonathan alone after the latter leaves to go see where IRyS was.\n\n----\n\n***(content warning ahead)***\n\nBijou returned to doing her business when she noticed an [eerie, deafening silence](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21666). Only Elizabeth and Shiori were around in the Building Area. She thought of calling her brother to see what was up… [at the nick of time](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21724).\n\nThis was how Bijou found out that her brother was thinking of going away…... forever. She didn’t have the entire context for why—all she knew was that she had been berated. She rushed as fast as she could to go save her.\n\nBased on what he said his location was, her instincts led her to the Antigonian Aerie. She loved her Onii-chan so much… so much that she would follow wherever he went. Even if it meant *diving off a cliff right next to him.*\n\n[The Goddess is descending.](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21847)\n\nGonathon and Tam jumped off with them. While they survived the fall, IRyS and Bijou both perished…\n\n…*\"in Minecraft.\"* \n\nThe blood-pact brothers respawned on the warp point, seemingly given a second chance.\n\nIRyS’ pain subsided briefly, but it came back. Is the baby… still there? IRyS believes so; she’s a goddess, after all. But could the baby be an eldritch being, a demi-god, or both? Or is it just food after all? *Only time will tell.* They still plan to surprise her consort (Ina) with the news the next day.\n\n----\n\nAfter this traumatic experience, she [meets with Shiori again](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=22527) to talk about the circumstances for the gender reveal party. After the absolute chaos that ensued that day, they sat on the front porch of the house next to the wagon. Elizabeth was there as well. It’s at this moment when Princess Bijou, ever innocent, asked the Red Knight…\n\n[\"Do you think there are truly good people in this world?\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=22748)\n\nThey also spent some time gossiping about the lore of the kingdom so far before heading out. Bijou listened to Elizabeth’s answer to her question in earnest, but… she wasn’t convinced.\n\nShe already turned in her journal; her thoughts have not changed. She needs some time to think about it. To see if her words were true. Her world view had turned more cynical after today.\n\nShe does admit, at least, that she needed that talk with the Red Knight. She needed that moment looking up in the sky, and to the buildings in front of them. It eased her mind at least a little.\n\nDespite her rock-hard appearance, today proved our Princess Bijou had a soft, emotional core prone to crumbling in the face of drama. She wonders if she could handle existing in this universe.\n\n*\"We will have to see what tomorrow brings.\"*\n\nShe went to bed with her dearly beloved that night.",

            "content": "**What Does It Mean to be a Knight?**\n\nThe previous day’s events had left Gonathon G a broken and deeply troubled knight. However, as the sun rose on a new day, Gonathon was resolute in her desire to seek redemption and improve.\n\nFirst, Gonathon paid a visit to her therapist Mordan Ramsey, whom she had desperately petitioned for aid the night before (see [Calli-Gonathon: Confidently Confidential](#edge:calli-gigi)). Beginning their session in earnest, Mordan implored the knight to fight for her own beliefs and code, rather than blindly following the wishes of others. She further told a [love story](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=964) between a maiden and knight, one that was deeply familiar to Gonathon (and was in fact one of her and her Pearl.)\n\n[You are the master of your own fate](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=1076)\n\nGonathon’s travels that day would see her lending aid to many people, including those she had every right to see as rivals or foes. For Princess Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Good Neighbors](#edge:gigi-bijou)), the one who was now betrothed to her former love Shiori, the humble knight apologized for using Shiori to fill the hole in her heart left by her Pearl, and the two promised to always help one another. And for Bae the Peasant (see [Bae-Gonathon: A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed](#edge:bae-gigi)), who Gonathon had feared was corrupted and threatening the land, Gonathon gave her the courage to confess to Immerkind, seeking to make right the error she had committed in shackling Immerkind’s heart to the Princess. Even the Hot Pink One, who perhaps most of all was undeserving of any generosity, the humble knight swore to serve as a loyal guard dog, although this would prove to be a troublesome arrangement in due time.\n\nSoon after, Gonathon joined up with the Wolf Pack to tackle the next dungeon. Here Gonathon had a heart-to-heart with Shakira that saw the wily phoenix consoling Gonathon on her personal strife and arranging for Mordan to groom the scruffy knight. Free of fleas and full of determination, Gonathon fought alongside the Pack in Star Site: Chaos, besting its games of chance and ferocious Stain King. Following a revelation of Bae’s true identity, Gonathon found herself face to face with an all too familiar person: the Outlander.\n\n[Take this! Revelation!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=7292)\n\nAn intense duel saw Gonathon emerge victorious once more, and a flood of memories return. When asked why she fought and what Libestal meant to her, Gonathon [responded resoundingly](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=7383): from now on, she would not fight simply because she was told or because of blind duty, but because it was what she believed in. For her, Libestal meant kindness, compassion, and above all always fighting for what you believed in.\n\n[My own code, my own honor! The way of a knight!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=7585)\n\nFollowing this, Gonathon met with the aloof, but deeply familiar Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame (see [Elizabeth-Gonathon: Honor and Justice](#edge:liz-gigi)). As a fellow knight, Liz had become deeply concerned with Gonathon’s dealings with Shiori. She too asked Gonathon what she was fighting for, and after being asked what she thought of Gonathon, the scarlet knight described the [deep kinship](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10855) she felt for Gonathon, Immerkind, and Roa. The two agreed they shared a special bond, and resolved to fight for an even higher cause than mere honor or love: that of Justice. Filled with resolve, Gonathon went forth to confront her greatest challenge of the day: reconciling with Shiori Nyavella.\n\n[The Knights heed the call for Justice](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10989)\n\nThe [reunion of the diamond and black pearl](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11506) proved bittersweet. Shiori lamented Gonathon’s flaws, both past and present. Yet despite all Gonathon had done wrong, Shiori assured the knight that while she was indeed a fool, she had a good heart. It was this good heart that was on display as, during an intense couple’s therapy session and child custody battle between Bae and Shiori and Bijou, Gonathon would assist in smoothing out the difficulties they shared, even promising to provide monetary support to the child. The new family, dubbed State Farm, parted on happy terms and, following a final heart to heart with Mordan in which she provided career advice to her former therapist, Gonathon prepared to turn in for the night.\n\n[A happy ending…for now](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=14038)\n\nBut her most grueling trial was yet to come, for yet another figure needed Gonathon’s aid: her beloved queen, Tam Gandr (see [Gonathon-Kronii: The Sham Queen’s Sacrifice](#edge:kronii-gigi)). Tam had become enslaved by the deviant HPO, and had fallen into a pit of despair not unlike that which Gonathon had experienced the previous day. [Enraged](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15494) that her queen would be treated this way, Gonathon implored Tam to stand up for herself and demand the respect she was owed as a monarch. The queen was moved to tears, thanking Gonathon for always standing with her, even at her lowest. Sadly, the HPO arrived before Tam could be properly steeled, and Gonathon was forced to flee in tears as Tam fell to the foul goddess’s mercy.\n\n[The Queen’s Most Loyal, Treasured Knight](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15915)\n\nUnwilling to abandon her queen and treasured friend, Gonathon charged back into the fray, only to find that Tam had heeded her advice and laid low the degenerate pink creature. After foiling an attempt by HPO to escape her responsibility, Gonathon and Tam had a [bewildering heart to heart](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=18669) in which the knight convinced the queen to seek a more equal role in the relationship…and expanded cat kissing rights. Thus Gonathon’s first steps to redemption came to an end, and while the knight still has much work to do, she resolved to stay optimistic and hold her head high.\n\n[Writing the daily journal](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16249)",

Khaos would note warily that the Princess would stare at her at times, intensely as if memories will come back to her if Bijou stared at Khaos long enough. Khaos in turn would wonder why the princess looked oddly familiar.\n\nEventually, the past unveiled itself:\n\nBijou would confront Bae about Khaos, about her regrets, about her foolishness, and the intent to make things right - to Khaos's other mother, at least.\n\nKhaos was too young to remember the past but all she wanted was the present. Her Mother.\n\nIt only brought a large sense of relief when Mother refused to part with her. That Mother viewed Khaos as child of her own.\n\nIt was terrifying to see Mother so angry against everyone and Khaos was glad to see that everyone reconciled in the end. Though she's a little bit wary of Princess-Mother, it seems she did not dislike Khaos. \n\nNow, Khaos waits for a new room. One for her and her new little sibling too!",

The sagely Mordan then began to tell a love story between a kindhearted knight and a maiden that seemed [eerily familiar](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=974), but Gonathon continued to insist she was not worthy of love and loyal to her queen. Mordan insisted that blind loyalty was “ick” and that Gonathon needed above all else to make decisions for her own sake. Gifting Gonathon a beautiful mural of herself (which Gonathon sneakily returned the favor by placing her own mural in Mordan’s home) the two parted for the time being.\n\nLater, the wolf pack once again assembled to delve into a dungeon. It was here that the wily Shakira once again brought the therapist and knight together by convincing Mordan to [groom](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=5062) the scruffy knight of the flees afflicting her. The pack then descended into the dungeon, and although difficult they easily proved victorious. Having overcome two trials with Gonathon, one of the mind and another of the realm, the two seemingly said farewell for the day.\n\n[What exactly is the Wolf Pack?](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=4946)\n\nAlas for poor Mordan, this trials would pale in comparison to what would come next, however the hardship would come not from the knight, but from the quarrelling Peasant Bae and Princess Bijou (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:bae-bijou)) who were engaged in a custody battle for Khaos. The lengthy, grueling couples therapy that followed saw Gonathon serving as a voice of reason, but sadly the other three left in disgust following an outburst by Mordan calling out what she saw as their prejudices.\n\n[God she is so \\*\\*\\*\\*ing crazy](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=13255)\n\nA crestfallen Mordan vowed to give up therapy forever, but Gonathon insisted her skills had proven invaluable to bringing the knight back from the brink of despair. Trading places with Mordan, Gonathon now sat in the therapist’s chair. She repeated a [line of advice](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=13671) she had given Bijou days before: to not allow the misery of customer service take the twinkle out of her eye. The humble knight implored Mordan to take up fortune telling instead, as not only could she help people, but the blame would be solely on the gods. Thoroughly amused, Mordan replied she would consider it, and the two wolves ended their day on a much happier note than before.\n\n[You have a heart of gold, don’t let them take it from you](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=13585)",

It was to Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Good Neighbors](#edge:gigi-bijou)) that the subject of the witch would come to the spotlight, with Gonathon expressing her regret for using Shiori to fill the hole in her heart left by the loss of her Pearl. The witch and the knight would not stay apart for long though, and Gonathon soon found herself once again waiting outside Shiori’s door. \n\n[My Fumbling Knight](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11508)\n\nOverhearing a phone conversation between Shiori and Liz, Shiori held nothing back in expressing her disgust for Gonathon’s actions. This did not dent the knight’s resolve and she quickly confronted Shiori directly. The witch continued to [hold nothing back](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12262), referring to Gonathon as a fumbling knight and disparaging her for requiring so much support to commit to her actions in the past. Chief of all, Shiori presented a question that Gonathon had herself deeply considered: that Gonathon was simply treating her as a salve for her wounded heart, and that as a [Black Pearl](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12317), she was simply an imitation of the real thing. \n\nDespite all that Gonathon had done, and despite admitting she was still a fool, Shiori could not deny her feeling that the knight deep down was a [good person](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12416). Gonathon for her part apologized to the witch and expressed regret for the way she had treated her.\nHowever, Gonathon’s role in Shiori’s story was far from over. Recruited by Bijou as a form of “moral support”, Gonathon played witness to the intense custody battle between Peasant the Bae and Shiori and Bijou. Wanting to play her own part in the child’s upbringing, Gonathon vowed to provide funds for child support, and in turn joined the newly formed State Farm family. \n\n[We’re good neighbors!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=14029)\n\nFrom there, Shiori would attempt to dissuade Gonathon from being too brash about assisting Tam Gandr, although her words were unable to restrain the loyal knight from leaping to her queen’s defense. As the witch and knight parted for the final time that day, it was abundantly clear that Shiori was far from done with the humble knight, and in some ways may just be getting started in pulling on her strings.",

Stripped of her dignity and [blackmailed](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15489) by those she once loved, it was now her turn to seek the aid of the knight who the previous day she had wrenched from her own abyss. \n\nInitially seeking therapy from Mordan, upon learning of her retirement Tam begged Gonathon to help her.

And the queen’s faith was well placed, for upon hearing of Tam’s enslavement to HPO, Gonathon flew into a rage and implored the queen to fight for her dignity and status as a monarch. \n\n[It’s over…it’s so over](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15613)\n\nGonathon mused over their options, including taking HPO to court, while a shellshocked Tam thanked Gonathon for her [purity and unbreakable loyalty](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15872).

Despite wishing to remain by her queen’s side, Tam’s tearful plea to not witness her humiliation forced Gonathon to retreat, but not before promising to return. Writhing with frustration over the queen’s plight, Gonathon was briefly consoled by Shiori and Bijou, but their words imploring the knight to not get involved only served to harden the knight’s resolve: she had to save her queen!\n\n[I don’t want you to see me like this…](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16167)\n\nRushing to her queen’s side once more, Gonathon was shocked to find that Tam Gandr had turned the tables on the degenerate pink Nephilim, who was now groveling at Tam’s feet. Joining forces with Tam once more, the two of them along with Bijou talked HPO out of [jumping to her demise](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17973) (although this did still occur, with Tam and Gonathon surviving the fall). Gonathon had a truly perplexing heart to heart with Tam and urged her to stand up for herself and earn more respect, along with cat kissing rights. Flabbergasted, but still thankful for her knight’s steadfast loyalty, Tam praised Gonathon for all she had done. Witnessing one final exchange between HPO and the queen in which Tam stated that Gonathon was all she needed, Gonathon departed, content of the good deeds she had done for her beloved queen.\n\n[I guess we’re kissing cats now?](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=18803)",

Enraged over the treatment of her queen, Gonathon pleaded with Tam to not allow HPO to demean her in such a manner. Alas, Tam was seemingly powerless to oppose HPO, and upon HPO’s return and renewed degeneracy towards the queen, Gonathon was forced to make a tactical retreat at [Tam’s behest](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16162). \n\nUnwilling to simply abandon her queen to the deviant goddess, Gonathon rushed back in to assist Tam. It was there that Gonathon witnessed an incredible scene: Tam taking her words to heart and [bringing HPO to heel](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17471). HPO, shedding any semblance of being a respectable goddess, fled with her tail between her legs before threatening to jump to her demise.

And Bijou doing math for 30 minutes for Bae.\n\nBut this friendship would be put to the test when Bae bought what seemed like a hat. A hat that Bijou couldn't help but eye with familiarity. \n\nBijou was worried as memories of the past slowly returned to her. Something had happened, a terrible fate had befallen her and would have consumed her if not for others. A fate that Bijou feared the Peasant might experience herself.\n\nThen, Bijou's memories wholly returned.\n\nThe hat on Bae's head wasn't an evil artifact! It was her child! Her child with her beloved Shiori Nyavella. \n\nAnd so, Bijou would plead to Bae for her child. To have Khaos back. For Shiori's sake. \n\nBut rather than sympathy, Bae was appalled by Bijou's story. A child abandoned by both parents should be loved and looked after by someone who truly cared!\n\nThis dispute eventually led them to receive counselling form Mordan Ramsey in order to decide custody - then, visitation. \n\nIt was a complicated matter fuelled by heated feelings from all sides that ultimately led to their therapist leaving and calling it a day and Bae and Bijou talking in Shiori's humble home.\n\nAs they watch Khaos and the second unnamed child Bae has adopted play together, the two make amends. They agreed that they both let their emotions overwhelmed them and that therapy was a waste of money and time.\n\nBae, who still had primary custody by the agreement of all parties involved, Bijou included, gave her blessing for Bijou to visit Khaos.",

Bae, having previously attempted to assist Gonathon in the previous day’s trials with Shiori of the Nyavellas, was deeply concerned with the knight’s wellbeing. Upon assuring Bae she was doing better, Gonathon responded by asking what was on the peasant’s mind. Bae proceeded to spill her guts: that she was [in love with Immerkind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=1994s) but hesitant to express her feelings due to Immerkind’s obsession with the Princess of Libestal. \n\nGonathon rebuffed her concerns, stating that she should [follow her heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=2158s) and urging the peasant to write a letter laying her feelings to bare for Immerkind. Although the two agreed that marriage was perhaps too hasty, Bae fervently thanked Gonathon for her advice and promised to make good on the courage the knight had given her. Later, Gonathon would proofread the letter along with NinoIna, and the heartfelt and passionate feelings expressed in it moved the two to tears. \n\nGonathon’s next encounter with Bae would not be in person, but rather through [memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=6486s) obtained in Star Site: Chaos. From there Gonathon learned that Bae was in fact a trickster Djinn capable of granting wishes. However, the clumsiness and foolishness showcased by the peasant turned genie in the memory did little to change Gonathon’s perception of her, and the knight continued to treat her as an equal and friend. \n\nSadly the knight and peasant’s next encounter would be far from pleasant, as Gonathon was drawn into the custody conflict between Bae and Shiori and Bijou over the fate of the latter’s child, Khaos. Following a protracted and bitter feud between the parties, they eventually agreed to share custody, with Gonathon joining the newly formed [State Farm family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=14038s). Thankfully the day would not end on a sour note, as Bae would request Gonathon’s assistance in her proposal to Immerkind. The gleeful knight eagerly agreed to wingman for Bae, and while the future remained murky for the two of them, they agreed to charge forth together. \n\n[A plot born of love](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=6488)",

Still following the 15 agents of drama, scams, and emotional damage?\n\nApparently so. But hey, even the wildest horses need to catch their breath sometimes. Or at least, that’s what it *seemed* like on the surface.\n\nDay six didn’t begin with a brand-new dungeon, unlike the ones before it. Instead, the heroes were offered something different: a special quest. A *ritual*. Or simply put—a game. A test of wits, trust, and lie detection. Everything they had previously used to stir up trouble, now turned toward a challenge of intellect and teamwork. \n\nUpon clearing the ritual, the heroes were rewarded with a mysterious book: **“The Truth of Ruin.”** Within it, scattered fragments of knowledge—clues about the evil that rampaged the world—began to take form. The deeper truths of the world they found themselves in… slowly began to reveal themselves.\n\n![The heroes attempting The Ritual](/images-opt/ritual.webp)\n\nNow normally, this is the part where the summary descends into chaos. But today? Things remained oddly... tame. Well, tame *by Libestal standards*, which still includes:\n\n* Roa taking Elizabeth on a “date,” only for it to be constantly interrupted by Elizabeth’s ex-daughter.\n* Immergood confesses her feelings to the Princess she’s been low-key obsessed with for a while now. Sweet, fluffy, even emotional.\n\nIt was all cute. All calm. A bit *too* calm.\n\nThis felt like the “calm before the storm.” Tiny ripples of tension hinted at the greater waves to come. A tense conversation between Elizabeth and Shiori sowed the seeds for something heavier. Shiori, quietly sets the stage for what could become the climax of her entanglement with Gonathon. The chessboard was being set.\n\n![Shiori's message for Gonathon](/images-opt/to-gonathon.webp)\n\n\nBut on the lighter, wholesome side—Fuwawa’s café finally got some visitors! Yay for the fluffy cook and her dream slowly coming true.\n\nBrace yourself, though. This silence? It won’t last.",

Maybe, just maybe, her dream would never come true?\n\nBut then, Shiori called.\n\nShe wanted a catering commission—for a picnic party, no less. Fuwawa, of course, would’ve loved to say yes right away, but doubt crept in. Was she even good enough? Could she really handle it? That was when Shiori hit her with the most unexpected news.\n\n[BAU BAU?! BAU BAU!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=0iZ1c9GCaj656Svv&t=546)\n\nEverything in her store had sold out.\n\nFuwawa was stunned. Absolutely stunlocked. Surely it was some sort of mistake? But as she scrambled to check the receipts, it was real. Real purchases, real customers—from all kinds of faces, friends and strangers alike. That disbelief melted into joy, a joy so overwhelming it felt like getting hit with a sugar rush. Her efforts, her patience, her heart—it had all paid off.\n\nWith her heart soaring, she happily [accepted](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=vtoeq8O8RAHIIn9a&t=887) Shiori’s commission and immediately set out gathering the best ingredients she could find. This would be the biggest moment in her café’s history.\n\nThe day kept its joyful tone. She joined her friends for [dungeon runs](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=6WRoJPkQV_34PHWe&t=3259), played a wild [mystery game](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=yz34Cw6rxpyzXVRi&t=6291) where everyone got hilariously heated, and despite being [knocked around](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=lhXHVG9PyhL9_hd_&t=5287) by the Outlander at first, she stood back up with encouragement from her friends and overcame the challenge.\n\n[I did it!

People stopped in, tasted her food, and their reactions? Pure awe. They smiled—but none as brightly as Fuwawa. She had done it. She had made others happy with her cooking. Her dream had become real.\n\nNow, a new goal stood before her: make the upcoming picnic party the best it could possibly be. Saying she wasn’t nervous would be a lie—it was a huge job, and the thought of the store going empty again did haunt her. But those fears could wait. What mattered now was holding onto this moment, this happiness, and doing everything she could to make sure it lasted forever.\n\n[Today was a happy day](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=38SXUkohf-G30Q0v&t=12153)",

So naturally, Mococo had been expecting warm gifts and greetings from her friends. \n\n\nShe first received an upgrade stone from Shakira to pay for therapy costs (to which Mococo later writes a thank you sign for). Then, Mococo ventured to the Jade Forge, where she met her sister - [who had just now learnt of her birthday](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=677) - had given her more stones as a gift for her wonderful sister.  \n\nBack in *Gacharms*, Mococo decided she would take over the store for a short while.\n\nLater on, Bijou pulls Mococo aside to give her a salary for helping the business.  The money-hungry dog grew sporadic once her fellow jeweler finally bestowed her *2250 coin* profit share from their business. That's [BIG MONEY!](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=1392s)\n\n\nShe used this golden opportunity to advertise to Bijou her (un)professional mental health services for the low, low cost of 100 coins!. Such affordable pricing convinces Bijou enough to actually try her phone therapy out.  \n\n[\"Have you considered 'don't think, just jam?'\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=1505)\n\nNow to other matters - such as completing the Star Site: Chaos Dungeon! With the help of Gonathon, Immerkind, and Bijou, Mococo knew that anything is possible... [even though she lost the disc gacha.](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=4441s) \n\nShe went on to fight the Outlander. During which, she received a call from Nerissa to complete a new, *special* quest called *the Cursed Tome*. \n\nTo play the quest, Nerissa opened a ritual for Mococo, Gonathon, and Elizabeth to join! \n\nAnd, uh oh! - This pup got cursed! \n\nShe can't let anyone know about it. Even if they had [succeeded](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=6406s) in the quest, she felt the urge to be curse-free. \n\n*What would the others think?* \n\nWell - Her friends reassure her that they would always be there, even if she had indeed been cursed. Even so, this doggy still retreated into a corner to recover for the night...",

            "content": "From the start of the day, it seemed that Liz had Juliet living rent-free in the back of her mind. Her usual morning routine of writing her journal left an entire section dedicated [to Juliet, signed by Romeo](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=7SOCL_EVYdha0nu6&t=270). Elizabeth felt bound by duty, memory, and expectation, leaving her envying Nerissa's freedom or perhaps admiring it.\n\nWith more gifts from anonymous donors, Elizabeth realizes it's time to expand the LOO and move its location from indoors to around the backside, making it easier to access the basement from behind the Jade Forge.\n\nAfter a mighty fight with the ping ghost, Elizabeth returns home to hear [ominous noises](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=xi3bxaGJIB71yY1m&t=11566) from somewhere nearby. As a Jade Sword Knight, she takes it upon herself to investigate where the loud music comes from. Unable to find the source with the music stopped, she put a pin in this concern to handle later.\n\nWithout a second thought, she finally purchased the [gorgeous ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=12995s). And soon after, encounters Shiori. After a brief discussion about [self-insects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=13650s), Elizabeth crafts a loving letter meant for...Shiori. After quickly gifting this witch a rose and a CD in return for her kindness, Elizabeth recedes her request for memories of Nerissa to respect her privacy. And doesn't hand over the letter.\n\nCalling upon Raora for an earlier request to upgrade her weapon, Elizabeth sets out to show her where to obtain the items. After a traumatic fall off the edge of a mountain, Raora and Elizabeth find themselves [stuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=16810s). A quick call to Nerissa has Raora on the defensive, saying there was no need, but Elizabeth does so anyway. After Bloodfumble returns with poor phrasing, Bijou joins them, and the call ends.\n\nAgainst her wishes, Elizabeth has no choice but to use magic to escape to safety.\n\nSoon after, the event begins with a letter from the Princess herself. Everyone is to perform a ritual to clear a mysterious and cursed tome. Without a second thought, Elizabeth teams up with Nerissa, Gonathon, and Mococo. The group successfully clears it in two tries, and concern rises for her sister Mococo, who was double-cursed during the ritual.\n\nAfter reading the book in the library, Elizabeth finally talks to Nerissa, requesting they spar again. After a short talk with Gonathan, she makes it up to the sparring area after walking the entire way again like a true and proper knight.\n\nWith a 2-0 fight in Liz's favor, Nerissa has one last chance to win and claim the prize. Without being nicked even once, the Witch wins the battle and passes her the [ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=20317s).\n\nBack at the Jade Forge once again, the ominous music returned. After a quick call agreeing to make some frames for Shiori, Elizabeth quickly calls fellow knight Gonathon for aid in finding the source of this music. Raora also joins the three of them in beginning the search for the source of this music.\n\nThe trap door in front of Nerissa's shop is discovered. Descending from above, they find the painting of Nerissa on full display down below. A quick deduction finds they can [walk through](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=TBhhbOiLoWd3Pp5n&t=21702) and find a chest with a rose inside and four books.\n\nRaora has a fit about the books, not wanting Liz to read them before taking off, upset and leaving Elizabeth and Gonathon to inquire about the readings. Finding the music too loud, the two of them go upstairs to read into the stories before them.\n\nConcern rises within Elizabeth as she reads on. Once she encounters the Witch, she quickly asks Nerissa if she's okay. Questions lead to no one knowing how the painting got down below the ground, which leads to Elizabeth requesting that Nerissa stay the night in her LOO for safety.\n\nAfter a brief break, Nerissa again approaches Elizabeth about reading The Cell by Shiori (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\nConcern rises within the knight. With the worries on her mind, Elizabeth hunts down Shiori, calling her stories scams and lies. However, Shiori asks her an unexpected question.\n\n[\"That's you as Lady Bloodflame, who were you before Lady Bloodflame?\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=0eOrNhfGkfXIozs5&t=24224)\n\nWith the question ringing in her mind, Elizabeth returns to her room and scraps the initial letter meant for Shiori, instead writing a letter to Mococo before tucking away for the night.",

            "content": "It was a sleepy start for Roa's day as she pondered what to do. Her beloved shop, The Gacharms, was doing well with little for her to do. Perhaps today she should focus on something else... Or Someone else.\n\nWith that person in mind, Roa [called her Red Knight](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=748). She needed more upgrade stones, which Elizabeth was more than happy to supply, though she would need materials to craft them. Seeing this opportunity, Roa would offer to go with her to the Remnant fields to help mine for the Enigmatic Stones they would need. Elizabeth agreed and suggested that they meet by the wagon.\n\nAs Roa waited, giddy to see Elizabeth once again, she came across Fuwawa and was shocked to hear that Fuwawa had never bought a charm before. As a businesswoman, Roa found it would be a travesty to let a customer get away; she quickly brought Fuwawa to The Gacharms Shop, explaining the mechanics of the gacha system, which ended with [Fuwawa winning splendid prizes](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=978). \n\nSoon enough, Elizabeth called to meet her by the wagon to start their, in Roa's eyes, date when Bijou suddenly appeared nearby. [Bijou would ask Roa how her pursuit fares](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=1668). Excited, Roa told her she would have a date with Elizabeth soon.\n\n[A Pretty Kitty and Her Shining Star](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=1970)\n\nA glowing moon lit the field while the stars above glowed with delight. An objectively beautiful scene with [a Mysterious Fish](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=2021) drowning in the background. \n\nRoa's date with Elizabeth went well with the two idly talking as they mined. Roa then subtly inquired about [Elizabeth's Secret Admirer](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=2155). Elizabeth still had no clue about who could be the one leaving her gifts and mentioned wanting to give them one as thanks. Sensing the opportunity, Roa told Elizabeth that perhaps Elizabeth would find out soon enough.\n\nThe date was going well. They were spending more time together when, unfortunately, a romcom episode is incomplete without something going wrong: [Roa fell and was stuck at the edge of the world](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=2635), with Elizabeth following soon after. Panicked that they wouldn't be able to get back, Elizabeth would immediately call for help. From Nerissa Ravencroft. Roa's Rival.\n\n[LEEERRRROOOOOYYYYY JEENKIIINNN!](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=2764)\n\nWith a clever timing from Bijou, she gave Roa a moment of levity to distract her from her jealousy and regain her composure. But as quickly as she crashed, Bijou left, and the green-eyed monster swiftly  returned. Still miffed that Elizabeth would still refer to Nerissa for help, Roa immediately figured out how to get out of their predicament, and both found their way back to Libestal. Elizabeth would give the legendary upgrade stones, and Roa would promise to repay this kindness by [giving the Knight some of her best charms](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=3227).\n\nElizabeth would then take Roa to see her new  [LOOO(Liz's Out of Office)](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=3331), a rather comfortable bedroom-office. Roa was admired when a melody started playing. It was almost romantic at first, but then the moment would ultimately be ruined by Nerissa's [gifts were mentioned](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=3463).\n\nRoa would then meet Bijou to ask about their inventory; perhaps there was something suitable there for Elizabeth. But the gifts would have to wait as the job must be done first: to purify the tome. They all met in the assembly hall to begin their quest.\n\n\nTogether with Ina, Bijou, and Bae, Roa had to play a strange game to find who was cursed by the tome. It was confusing, as the cursed one would shift after each round, and their answers would sometimes be too close to tell who would try to foil their attempts. \n\nThe curse would shift from Bae to Roa to Bijou until it was purified bit by bit, leaving a book that may be able to answer some of their questions. But, [concern lingered](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=5760) about the possibility that the curse may have stayed with someone, but it was a concern thankfully unfounded. In the library, they uncover [The Truth of Ruin](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=5936). The source of Ruination and Stains may not be from Libestal but elsewhere...\n\nBusiness done, Roa met Queen Tam in the Quest Hall and heard that something interesting happened the other day after Roa left. It seemed to be too complicated for the Queen to explain, and Roa could only wonder what transpired. Gonathan would also remind Roa of the Constipation Party (also known as 'The End of World Party').\n\n\nRoa would heed Bijou's advice and craft Elizabeth's charms herself. Satisfied with what she had, Roa would go to meet her at the Jade Forge. There, the music returned. The music led them underground where, a [portrait of Nerissa was displayed](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=7518). Behind it... were gifts meant for Elizabeth.\n\nThe jealousy finally culminated, erupting from [Roa as she demanded that Elizabeth put the gifts back](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=7582), reminding Elizabeth that *Nerissa is a witch*. Roa would run away in tears and spend her time in the Remnant fields. There, she swore to earn the gold, [5000 coins to buy a gift](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=7759) for Elizabeth, and confess her feelings. It was an endless battle. Stain after Stain, Roa unleashed all her frustrations against those who stood in the way of her love. \n\nBut through her pain, and through Bijou's busy phone, Roa planned to bring Elizabeth here, [to the top of the remnant field, and confess her feelings](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=8387). In the midst of her planning, Bijou finally called back. Bijou had some money from the shop to give, and there was something beautiful to see by Fuwawa's Cafe. \n\nPerhaps it was due to seeing Fuwawa doing her best, perhaps it was the food she served, but Roa felt more relaxed. Sadly, the moment was lost when Bijou inquired about Roa's date. But, rather than anger, Roa was more determined to win Elizabeth's love. \n\nIn another turn of clichéd events, Elizabeth was suddenly nearby. Worried about how Roa had suddenly left, Elizabeth had informed Roa that she put back the items in Nerissa's spot, and Roa immediately took the opportunity.\n\n[Charms for Her Red Knight](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=8936)\n\n3 legendary charms for a Legendary Knight. Roa apologised as well, for running suddenly, which Elizabeth immediately said she understood. Roa told Elizabeth to remember her when she fights with her charms, that they would watch her in Roa's place. Touched, Elizabeth called Roa her shield... [When the moment was ruined by the music playing.](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=9064) \n\nSo what if Nerissa may have already caught Elizabeth's eye? So what if the Raven had magic and Roa didn't have magic? She's the owner of a successful business; if she can put her mind to gathering a large profit, then she can win Elizabeth's heart. Back in the fields, she fought once again until [the money, then the ring, was hers.](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=9770)\n\nRing obtained. Charms restocked. Roa was almost done for the day. She passed by the party location and listened to Bijou's plan for her brother and her eternal consort for tomorrow. Excited, she showed Bijou and Shiori the ring when Shiori mentioned Elizabeth was upset, and there seemed to be turmoil between her and Nerissa.\n\nConcerned and selfishly motivated, Roa began looking for Elizabeth until she found her in a call with *someone*. A moment of jealousy before realising it was Gonathan on the phone with Elizabeth, Roa changed the subject.\n\n[A painfully awkward moment was evoked by Bijou, who really loved maps on this RomCom Episode of EnReco](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10487), aside Roa quickly attempted to change the subject, but Elizabeth interrupted first, warning Roa to be careful of Shiori due to the false memories she sells. \n\n[Her Flame Differently Flickers... For the 3 of Them](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10566)\n\nRoa suggested that maybe it was different for the three of them. Hoping that hers was more special, [then, a Cloak of Wisdom](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10779), whose identity we totally, *completely* did not know (It's Bijou), appeared. Then a second, less suspicious cloak joined. The romantic moment may not have been there in the first place, Roa may have been comrade-zone, but there was no denying that there is a [special bond between Roa and Elizabeth.](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10878)\n\nSeeing Bijou once again, Roa took her aside, told her, and Shiori, how it went,  when [Shiori had a suggestion](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10994):\nTell Elizabeth little stories of Nerissa? That might jog Elizabeth's memory... The topic was immediately dropped when Immerkind and Gonathan passed by. Someone then immediately suggested using the Constipation Party area to propose to Elizabeth. Bijou includes blue and pink floating lanterns to set the mood.\n\nA plan was secured for tomorrow. Roa would soon write in her diary, the excitement flowing through her quill.\n\n[Hello Pandora](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=11534)\n\nNerissa passed by and they exchanged pleasantries. Whether Nerissa knew that Roa foiled her plans to make Elizabeth her own couldn't be known, but the two remain cordial as they parted ways.\n\n\n\n**Bonus Biboo Crashing Raora's and Liz's Date Moments**\n\n[Biboo is drowning in the waterfall](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=2021)\n\n[Biboo literally crashing](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=2764)\n\n[Music playing interrupts the date](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=9064)\n\n[Biboo on a tree](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10469)\n\n[Bijou, who really loved maps, on this RomCom Episode of EnReco](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10487)\n\n[Biboo found \"treasure\"](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10545)\n\n[2nd Monster music, may not have been Biboo, but she was there](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10566)\n\n[InvisiBiboo](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10779)\n\n[Bonus: Biboo just REALLY LOVES **maps**](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10896)",

Stories must be accurate, and a detail soon escaped Shiori that she had to briefly stop writing to check. On her way, she witnessed a tender moment between Elizabeth and Mococo in front of the Jade Forge. A small moment where Shiori complimented Elizabeth's business before quickly giving the [poor Knight gold](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=677), which Elizabeth refused, though she rejected her refusal. But a kind Knight Elizabeth is, and soon [Shiori received a gift of her own](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1734).\n\nShiori soon crossed paths with Fuwawa and told her that a special event would take place soon - the Hot Pink One's pregnancy announcement party - and asked if [Fuwawa's Cafe could cater the event](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=801) (which the goddess will be paying for since is *her* party) and if they could set up the venue near her cafe. \n\nA commission was finally done after Shiori added that last mossy cobblestone, and all that was left was to deliver the story. But, there were more commissions to finish stories... [and memories](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1098). Shiori wrote and wrote, putting down the memories only she, as The Archiver, could know. Details that her customers appreciated, as their true memories were also woven into some of the stories requested. Memories are a precious thing, and like precious things, they come at a price. Soon, the memory was finished and delivered to the Raven One. Now, another... [But at a more appropriate place](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1667). \n\n[A gift soon made its way to her](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1734) from a certain Red Knight to thank Shiori for her kindness. The two talked, and Shiori was pleased to see the stories she wrote for Elizabeth were displayed. In the midst of their chat, Elizabeth cancelled her memory commission of Ravencroft, to which Shiori easily agreed. The two would share a warm conversation before they parted ways. [It seems Shiori's plan is working today](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=2541).\n\nShiori later met Ina and Roa in the Quest Hall and immediately invited them to the party, letting them know it was for a gender reveal but [conveniently leaving out whose](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=4265). With Ina and Gonathan, they left for the Remnant field to gather some of the Enigmatic Stones, despite their awkward relationship gone wrong, the Good Knight still protected her from the Stains.\n\nSoon, it was time for her to meet the other heroes in order to purify a cursed tome. With Queen Tam, Cecilia, and Fuwawa, they began their efforts. Cursed books are tricky; something lingered within their parchments that refused to leave. But slowly and surely, the curse was slowly lifted, revealing The Truth Of Ruin. With some time to spare, Shiori invited Queen Tam to the party with the Queen's... mixed feelings. A Constipation Party.\n\nAfter receiving the construction boxes from Bijou's room, Shiori would set out to [start preparing the venue](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=7878) for tomorrow, inviting more along the way and letting them know it is now a party for Constipation. Gonathan, Queen Tam, and Bijou would also later join her efforts to spruce the place up.\n\nGonathan... would purchase 19 construction boxes to Shiori's frustration. As before, Gonathan would still spend his money on others, even when they do not need for his generosity. Shiori would [give him 2000 gold](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=8274) and firmly told him that it was his.\n\n[It seemed not everyone enjoyed the stories Shiori wrote](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=11131) \n\nElizabeth would criticize Shiori's story, saying that the details Shiori included within Nerissa's commission are filled with lies. Memories, especially when others were hurt, are hard to accept, and within Shiori's stories are hints of the truth of what happened before. Before Libestal.\n\n[*Who Were You Before \"Lady Bloodflame\"*](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=11253)\n\nThough the moment ended in tension, Shiori nonetheless affirmed that Elizabeth was still invited to the party.\n\nHer attention went back to the party until Roa showed Bijou the ring she bought for Elizabeth. Knowing how Elizabeth's relationship with Nerissa was tense at the moment, Shiori would quickly suggest to Roa that this is her opportunity. Shiori watched Roa attempt to confess, but ultimately, it was today wasn't Roa's day.\n\nIt was an admittedly slow day, Shiori wrote in her diary. Even after getting Queen Tam's prize, her fifth attempt at luck was a rather easy endeavour. Even teasing Cecilia about her love for Iphania - suggesting that perhaps Fia was another version of Iphania, and Cecilia could visit her more.\n\n\nHowever. The day ended much differently than Shiori thought.\n\nGonathan.\n\nThere was a matter she had to talk to Gonathan about. It was rather frustrating to see that he could not stand for himself. To see Tam speak for him rather stating his own wants. Not waiting for him to speak, Shiori left. Though he soon followed after, [for a moment there was a pregnancy scare for Shiori](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16782) but the moment passed.\n\n[Then... Bijou came to a realization](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16811)\n\nIt seemed that the party Shiori was setting up would also be for herself and Bijou. Whether it be a gender reveal or a joint-constipation party with Bijou's other, it is a matter that Shiori would find out tomorrow. But, there are other matters to attend to:\n \n\n[Pearl](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16935)\n\n\n\nShiori witnessed the past romance between the two. She remembered how much [Gonathan had agonized when Pearl lost her memories of her dear husband](https://youtu.be/i7g-HJMqZ_E?t=6028). The relief when they reunited. Shiori offered Gonathan a snippet of his memory with his pearl. Though at the cost of *Shiori's* memory of him. A precious memory was a costly one, one that Shiori would bear for the too-good-hearted knight. \n\nShe was punished before, and she wouldn't mind being punished again for doing this one thing. But the knight rejected her offer, for having [someone else punished](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17098) for the sake of his memory... Even when others told Gonathan of how much he loved Pearl, it wasn't worth having someone else pay the price for him.\n\n\n[***Shiori of Nyavella...

But it would be a lie to say just unkindness; many moments were filled with sweetness since Gonathan, for all his naive foolishness, was a knight too good for most. For Shiori. With that in mind, Shiori made him promise to buy a book from her stall the next day.\n\nShiori inquired about Bijou's feelings on her possible pregnancy and told her of Shiori's decision to forget Gonathan. As she waited for her wife to finish writing her diary, Shiori left to place a letter and roses for Gonathan to [find underneath his tree](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17908). Then started [writing the book she made him promise to buy](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=18081). In a cruel twist of fate, [Gonathan would walk by] ignorant that this would be the final meeting between him and the Shiori who loved him.\n\nBefore Shiori left to sleep, Queen Tam approached to apologise for interrupting her and Gonathan's talk earlier.",

Aside from her [portrait](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=344) being moved to a basement, which seemingly served as a secret room for worship. Behind the immaculate portrait were mysterious books stored. Are these books of witchcraft? Simple tales of love and loss? Or an ominous prophecy that has yet to unfold...\n\n---\n**The Quest for Truth**\n\nAfter completing her daily quests, Nerissa looked into her inventory and found a [special letter](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=996) from the Princess — a special quest? She pondered, she could show it to others now, or would it perhaps be better to wait for the right time? Setting that bit of mystery aside, she decided to pursue a different form of mystery by exploring more of the castle. The books she amassed in the previous days were quite intriguing... Journals of The Rider? The Explorer? The Researcher? Books of Prophecy??? There was certainly more to this world outside of collecting Fia’s memories and contributing to the Kingdom's economy.  She had yet to connect all the dots, for a few more pieces to the puzzle sat waiting to be discovered.\n\nIn her search for clues, she found more fascinating stories as she talked with the [villagers](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=1859). She learned of their hopes and dreams, their sorrows and their regrets as they stood waiting for their impending doom.\n\nIn light of this, she also found children playing [hide-and-seek](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=1941)... as if there was nothing to worry about, they run and hide, as free as birds flying in the sky. \n\n---\n**The Princess’ Chambers**\n\nAs she continued with her search, Nerissa stumbled upon [the Princess’ chambers](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=2162). There was a guard on duty in front of the door, and while he would say clear as day that nobody could enter the room on his watch, he didn’t really make any effort to stop the maiden from barging in.\n\nShe looked and looked... And to her surprise, she found letters in the drawers. From whom could they be? Growing curious, she invited herself to skim their contents... Love letters? From Cecilia Immerkind?!\n\n---\n**Six Feet Under**\n\nThe signs might not have been obvious earlier, but there had certainly been change in the demeanor of the once-sweet maiden. Throughout today, instead of focusing on her food business, or just providing food in general out of the kindness of her heart, she toiled underground, creating space to store a [strange device](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=4262) — an instrument that produced enchanting, hypnotic music.\n\nIt was quite the effort, as she needed to consult several spirits/ voices and grimoires to craft the device itself. Once done, it proved useful as she witnessed Lady Bloodflame fall prey to her collection of haunting [sounds](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=12262) (see: [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper-Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\n---\n**Stranger than Fiction**\n\nWas a witch actually born? Lady Bloodflame, Gonathon, and Roa Pandora accidentally found the first level of her secret shrine, as well as the books that were stored behind it. When [confronted](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=12240), she claimed she didn’t know why the painting was moved there, nor remember how the books were carefully shelved directly behind it.\n\nDid she really not remember? Or was she just deceiving them... for reasons not yet known to anyone?",

Instead of worrying about herself, she tried focusing more on helping others.\n\nShe still wanted a little [“pup talk”](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=420) after the madness of the last couple days, especially yesterday. So she rang up [Mococo](#node:mococo)—she only took appointments by phone.\n\nIt went far better than the service she got from the pink chef the other day. Then again, the bar to surpass that was already so low it’s practically level to the floor. She left a glowing review and left the call energized for the day. \n\nShe’ll probably be fine. [Just don’t think.](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=750)\n\n----\n\nBack at Gacharms, Fuwawa seems to be in the market for charms. Roa started handling it while she was away. Gonathan was even nice enough to give Fuwawa an extra ticket!\n\nBijou enjoyed the business while it lasted; as the end of the world draws near, they may not get many sales in the coming days.\n\nRoa soon tells Bijou she landed a date with the Red Knight, Lady Bloodflame! She asked for her Diamond Pickaxe as they were going material hunting. Bijou felt the urge to eavesdrop again, wondering how her boss does. (See [Raora-Elizabeth: Roa's Not-Beach Day Episode!](#edge:raora-liz))\n\nShe wasn’t too sneaky about this. While pretending to [“do her dailies”](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2122) and “love maps”, she fumbled constantly as she tried to get within earshot. She even [got caught](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2889) a few times while wandering too close to Lady Bloodflame.\n\nRoa and Elizabeth then got [stuck](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2958) on the edge of a cliff near an invisible border. It got worse as soon as Bijou heard the name “Nerissa”...\n\n[LEEEEROY JENKIIIIINS](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=3005)\n\nShe fell into the exact situation as her boss and the Red Knight. Luckily, she remembered her magic scroll and warped away. She didn’t even think of cleaning up after herself…\n\nShe wanted to get hold of Nerissa during that moment, only after hearing her name merely uttered without context. She wanted some food, but suddenly ~~her game crashed~~ fell asleep. Coming to, she just went back to the building area.\n\nApproaching Nerissa’s shack, she suddenly felt suspicious. As if Nerissa were right below her underground. Her voice was audible from above ground; it sounded like she was [in a call](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=3365) with someone. Bijou bought some of her chicken cutlets as if she heard nothing.\n\n----\n\nHer pursuits in eavesdropping would pause for a moment; she received two messages.\n\nFirst, [Shiori notified her](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=3475) by letter that she had sent over her second story commission. It was filled with little references that made her laugh.\n\nIt ended on another cliffhanger, though. Bijou asked Shiori to write more, though she was already flooded with commissions. She also noticed Nerissa donning a [red, pointy hat](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=3749)…?\n\nIt’s probably nothing. Anyway, Nerissa read the second message. It was from Princess Iphania about the [Ritual of the Cursed Tome](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=4764), happening today. Bijou led a group with Roa, Bae, and Ina, and they were successful after four attempts.\n\nA cryptic book in the library—[”The Truth of Ruin”](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=6143)—revealed itself once they were done. Its message left the warriors wondering about what it means. A being beyond this plane? The Curse? And who were the Collective? So mysterious…\n\n----\n\nImmerkind summons Bijou to the Great Hall. She wants her to act as moral support as she tries to propose to Princess Iphania. Bijou remained supportive of her knight, enabling her pursuit and feeling kind enough to lend her charms for the Outlander fight. (See [Immerkind.](#node:cecilia))\n\nWhile waiting to hear back from her knight, she kept herself company with the voices in her head… and started being a bit of a nuisance.\n\n[“Why is your chest bigger than mine?\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=6576)\n\nWhen Immerkind returned, Bijou let her off on their own devices… but she called back. There was clearly a misunderstanding, and Bijou was the one to clear it up. Indeed, *everyone* had the same dialogue with the Princess following the Outlander duel. It was a canon event.\n\nImmerkind started to spiral, now with their self-esteem down the drain. Suddenly, Bijou found herself beside Gonathan, acting as moral support while trying to talk sense into the kind knight. (See [Gonathan](#node:gigi).)\n\n----\n\nWith that over with, Bijou checked out how the picnic area [Shiori](#node:shiori) was making for tomorrow’s party of sorts for IRyS. She also picked up the cakes she ordered from [Fuwawa](#node:fuwawa), who was to provide catering. Tam provided the big “IT’S GAS” sign floating above.\n\nIt’s probably female gas, Bijou thought. She added pink wool to the back of the letters. Later, she would also have an idea of making floating lanterns around the picnic area, both in pink and light blue.\n\nThe picnic-in-preparation would soon be interrupted by [Roa](#node:raora). She wanted to talk to the Red Knight again; she bought the fanciest ring she could buy. She was gonna try making a move.\n\nNot just Bijou this time, but Shiori as well wanted to eavesdrop and see how it goes down. Neither of them were normal about this. They both went to the special shop to chug an invisibility potion.\n\nTechnology had not advanced well enough that their cloaks and effects would go invisible when the potion was consumed; only their bodies did. Roa tried covering up for as long as she could until… Bijou’s potion ran out.\n\n[Uncloaked](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=10983)\n\nRoa scolded Bijou for not being discreet about her snooping on her date. Though she didn’t realize that Bijou had been eavesdropping since her date earlier in the mountains. Because of her hard work in the shop, Bijou was forgiven.\n\nNow with Gonathan, Immerkind, the Queen, and [Shiori](#node:shiori), the five of them gathered for one last round at Star Site: Chaos; Immerkind had yet to win Bae’s music disc. Luckily, they made quick work of the dungeon, and she got it with a 94% drop rate.\n\n----\n\nLater, Bijou and Shiori had more or less finished decorating the “IT’S GAS” picnic area. She mostly appeared to be spaced out while Shiori took a call with Immerkind, but she did have some things to say anyway.\n\nShe decided to [start writing her journal](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=14570). She stopped halfway as Tam and Gonathan [approached](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=15364) the table. Of course, this conversation had to end up being cursed beyond belief. (See [Kronii](#node:kronii).)\n\nIt also revealed a *very shocking revelation:*\n\n[“AM I PREGAGANANT?!?!”](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=15785)\n\nSo much for innocence—**Bijou might be pregnant too.** And she literally forgot about the trade she did with Shiori *the other day*.\n\nAfter her heart-to-hearts with Shiori and her step-mom, the Queen, she finally went back to her journal, practically [screaming into it](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=16625) about this realization. She blames the cursed ritual for this; she got cursed twice after all.\n\nShe did one last bit of ~~eavesdropping~~ [map appreciation](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=17101) before turning in for the day. (See [Shiori](#node:shiori))\n\nBijou hopes the picnic preparations won’t go to waste; she figures it may be best to have the party before they go to the Heart of Ruin tomorrow. Who knows what will happen after they’re done at the final dungeon?\n\nWhatever tomorrow will bring… It’s probably filled with surprises. And maybe gas.",

            "content": "**Bonds Beyond Time**\n\nStarting her day once again at Gacharms, Gonathon conversed with her friends and assisted Fuwawa in upgrading her gear. Learning that several of her companions needed to do the previous day’s dungeon, the humble knight wasted no time in volunteering to assist. After a [quick rerun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=1113s) of the dungeon and some farming with Shiori and NinoIna (the latter of whom she engaged in potato touching with), Gonathon found herself at the Mysterious House with many others, all awaiting the announcement of a special event. \n\n[We are stronger together!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=2213s)\n\nWhile waiting for Nerissa to announce the event, Gonathon made small talk with her many companions, and in particular expressed befuddlement at the concept of a party. Upon Nerissa’s arrival, the knight and the others learned they would be partaking in a strange ritual involving a cursed tome. Although imposing, the [combined expertise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=3914s) of Gonathon, Liz, Nerissa, and Mococo made short work of the ritual. Following rejoicing and a scalp massage for Mococo, Gonathon departed from the group, particularly after witnessing Liz wanting to spend time with Nerissa. \n\nFollowing more perplexing conversations with NinoIna, Gonathon was queried by Shiori about putting together an End of the World party. This topic would be put on hold, for a befuddled Liz (see: [Elizabeth-Gonathon: The Knights’ Heartache](#edge:liz-gigi)) called on Gonathon for assistance. Liz explained that she had been hearing odd music at her forge, and the ever-inquisitive Gonathon quickly discovered a hidden trap door leading to an [odd room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=6694s) decorated with Nerissa’s mural and filled with poems. Leaving Liz to muse on these findings, Gonathon was called upon by yet another companion: the lovesick Immerkind.\n\nImmerkind (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Knight at Home with the Wolves](#edge:cecilia-gigi)), holding back tears, explained to Gonathon that she had made [the decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=7987s) to stay in Libestal with her love, the Princess. Gonathon, stricken with grief, stated she did not want to lose Immerkind, but at the same time concluded that, above all else, she wanted Immerkind to be happy. As Immerkind further explained her feelings, Gonathon came to a stark realization: that the words of the princess that Immerkind believed to be only for her were in fact ones she uttered to all the adventurers. Reluctant to accept the truth, but unable to deny it upon confirming with Bijou, Immerkind once more sought to take her own life, but was stopped yet again by Gonathon. She and Bijou begged Immerkind to reconsider, and after managing to talk their friend down, the three shared [a heartfelt talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9264s) about love and the wolf pack.\n\n[I don't want to lose you!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=8933s)\n\nThis sense of calm would not last long, as the humble knight once again found herself dealing with a familiar figure: Shiori of the Nyavellas. Talking with Liz, the scarlet knight divulged a [contentious conspiracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9461s): that she believed that Shiori was in fact selling false memories to others. Immerkind chimed in, [denouncing Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9785s) as well, stating that Gonathon had been framed for her fall two days prior, and that the two-toned witch was manipulating the kindhearted knight. Following a sojourn into Star Site: Chaos to assist Tam Gandr in receiving the music disk, Gonathon divulged Liz’s thoughts to the queen and Immerkind. Sandwiched (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Passed Pawn](#edge:kronii-gigi)) between her two closest friends, Gonathon admitted she was unsure if Liz’s words were true, as Liz herself seemed to have skeletons in her closet (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper-Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)). With most of their business done for the day, the three returned to the library and wrote their journals, and this was seemingly the end of things.\n\n[Gonathon protects the queen from painful memories](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12744s)\n\nInstead, Shiori’s tendrils would pull them back in. First, a seemingly innocent conversation between Shiori and Immerkind on the nature of Fia sparked an [intense, baffling discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=13617s) between Tam, Gonathon, and Immerkind on the nature of the self and love. Next, Shiori and Bijou pulled the trio into the party site, and seemingly, a new controversy surrounding the potential pregnancies of the witch and gem began to take shape. In a stark twist, this was not why Shiori had called Gonathon there, instead, she had a proposition for the humble knight, one that would shake her to her core (see [Gonathon-Shiori: A Memory for a Memory, a Pearl for a Pearl](#edge:gigi-shiori)).\n\nShiori proposed a [simple trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=14956s): she would provide a complete, clear memory of Gonathon’s Pearl so that Gonathon might remember that which she wished more than anything to remember. However, the cost would be steep: Shiori would lose her memories of Gonathon. This time, though, Gonathon would make a choice not for anyone else, but for herself: she did not think it right to rob Shiori of her memories simply for the chance to remember the Pearl. Seemingly satisfied, Shiori reminisced with Gonathon for a while, with the knight expressing deep regret for being able to love the witch properly.\n\n[I wish I loved you the way I wanted to.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15325s)\n \nAlthough Tam once more sought to open Gonathon’s eyes to Shiori’s duplicities, Gonathon remained faithful to all her friends.

Her recaps are so serene, you cannot believe it.\n\nRemember that talk the day before for the Hot Pink One telling the Hot Purple One everything today? Well, the Hot Pink One took a rest day, and was never seen around the kingdom; She escaped the hands of fate for one day.\n\nRegardless, the impact of IRyS' debacles permeate throughout the kingdom independent to her physical presence; There's a gender reveal party planned for a mystery newly-pregnant individual in Libestal — take a good wild guess who it was for. NinoIna received an invitation through word of mouth, knowing not of its nature, certainly not how close she herself was to the epicenter of it.\n\nThe Hero's appearances in the kingdom were not numerous — having all of her gear upgraded to their best form, she found less need to roam around the Remnants for materials; nowadays most of her busywork would be related to her daily tasks, and none beyond. But she would never shy away from the opportunity of being iconic in her interactions.\n\nUpon arriving on time at today's rendezvous point — which was apparently early, because none of the organizers were on location yet — she and the humble knight Gonathon with a G just messed around [engaged in conversation](https://youtu.be/EkwigIYpcdI?t=895s) and entertaining each other, (The sketch they're referencing originally came out 18 years ago.

NinoIna was no stranger to a sealed ancient tome — she had one of her own, after all. The mystical cursing properties of the tome also did not affect the Hero's vessel nor spirit in the slightest, as expected of a real Hero.\n\n[MEOWMEOW](#embed:https://youtu.be/EkwigIYpcdI?t=4685s)\n\n---\n\nDon't forget to check out Ina's [new outfit reveal](https://x.com/ninomaeinanis/status/1920677512775884951), a day after the end of ENreco Chapter 2!",

            "content": "Perfect Queen Tam Gandr woke up from her perfect slumber in her perfect “truck” abode.\n\nShe might have been a bit sleepy, but she was raring to go about her day. She even stopped for a moment to give tips to Fuwawa, who was struggling with her duel against the Outlander.\n\nIt seemed like a perfect day.\n\nAfter being summoned by Nerissa, Queen Tam and all the heroes went to the Assembly Hall. Everyone present that day exchanged pleasantries—and that’s when the cracks in her seemingly perfect day began to show, at the mention of the Hot Pink One and her “gassy” problem from the previous day.\n\nNerissa read out a letter sent by Princess Iphania regarding an ancient tome that could help the heroes fight the Ruination. However, a certain ritual needed to be performed—one that could even place them under the curse as well.\n\nEven then, Queen Tam had a more troubling matter at hand: Rao Pandora, and what had transpired the previous day. The latter was quick to remind her to remember what happened.\n\n[Sassy cat](#embed:https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=670)\n\nQueen Tam proceeded to form a party with Shiori, Immerkind, and Fuwawa—a surprising combination, to say the least—to tackle the ritual.\n\nThe ritual itself was odd and likely confused most of those involved, including Queen Tam. Either that, or she simply couldn’t help but act suspicious (which was ironic, considering that finding the suspicious one was one of the main objectives of the ritual).\n\nHaving finished the ritual without learning much of anything, Queen Tam had a quick conversation with Shiori—who wanted to organize a celebration for the HPO’s constipation upon her return. The Queen begrudgingly agreed and then headed to the main hall to gather materials from the shops.\n\nPerhaps due to the stress of the previous day, the Queen began desperately gambling away her coins for a chance to win \"figurines.\" It was there that she encountered Rao Pandora again and engaged in an awkward conversation about their new “relationship dynamic.”\n\nShe neither won any prizes nor regained any social standing with the big pink cat.\n\nTruth be told, the Queen simply didn’t know what to do anymore and decided to help Shiori with the cursed celebration for HPO. What greeted Queen Tam was a huge picnic blanket laid out in the field beside Fuwawa’s shop, with an amazing backdrop of Gonathon’s Treehouse. The tree’s owner even dropped by to donate materials for the decorations.\n\nIn a surprising turn of [character development](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=3400), the Queen admitted to others—for the first time—that she was poor and actually needed help. It only took two timelines and multiple disasters to bring her to this point.\n\nShiori and Queen Tam began working on the decorations—the former crafting a pretty wooden arch, and the latter creating a bombastic glowing sign that read “ITS GAS,” referring to the supposed “baby” born from HPO. It was a struggle, to say the least. The Queen refused to listen to the voices in her head telling her that her “S” looked like an invented alphabet.\n\nIn the end, everything literally clicked into place, and the Queen stood back to marvel at her handiwork. Of course, how could she err? She’s perfect. “It’s magnificent,” she said. [“This is the most creative I’ve been in my entire life,”](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=4713) she added.\n\nStruck with creative inspiration—and with a generous sprinkling of praise from Shiori—Queen Tam went back to her abode and decided to spruce it up. It did look like a \"truck,\" the voices in her head chimed. She began renovating most of the outer walls and ended up with a decidedly ominous-looking stone house. Queen Tam and the voices in her head were all confused at the outcome, but art is subjective—so who could say she did a bad job?\n\n[“I’m actually happy, not having to interact with people.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=6631)\n\nIndeed, that day was uneventful—at least in comparison with the tumultuous previous days. The voices remarked it was mostly due to the absence of HPO that day.\n\nAfter a brief exchange of howls with her knights, Gonathon and Immerkind, they all decided to tackle the Star Site: Chaos dungeon in order to retrieve the hidden treasure. Of course, this triggered [painful memories](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=7690) from the previous day for the Queen, who had suffered through the same dungeon over and over due to unsuccessful attempts—on top of the heated arguments with the two women she was secretly juggling. Together with the two knights, as well as Bijou and Shiori, they eventually retrieved the dungeon treasure from the Star Site.\n\nAfter being sandwiched in a closet between Gonathon and Immerkind, the Queen listened to her Humble Knight's recent woes. Apparently, Lady Bloodflame told him that Shiori was a scammer who sold memories because she actually remembers everything about them. Somehow, gossiping about Nerissa and Lady Bloodflame led to the three howling at the moon. No mentions of [maids](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=9901) were made by Immerkind.\n\nGetting ready to end the day with writing her journal entry, Queen Tam concluded on a happy note, saying she was excited for the next day.\n\nIf only the Queen’s day had ended there, it would have actually been perfect. However, she deemed it necessary to engage in a cursed conversation with Immerkind and Gonathon regarding the question: “If your lover turned into a cat, would you still love them?” The conversation devolved further, replacing the cat with a [tapeworm](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=11053)—much to the disgust of the voices in her head.\n\nThe day actually ended with a burst of drama under the “ITS GAS” signboard involving Shiori, Gonathon, and Bijou, who innocently asked how babies are born. Queen Tam was so taken aback by the question, the [pause](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=11542) itself was also pregnant.\n\nThe situation grew even more bizarre for the Queen and her Humble Knight when Shiori kept asking him to talk in private. Sensing more heartbreak for the gullible knight, Queen Tam did her best to separate him from Shiori and save him—much like how Gonathon had been there for her the previous day. It was then revealed that, somehow, Shiori was pregnant and that Gonathon wanted to take responsibility for the supposed child. Queen Tam managed to convince Gonathon that handholding does not indeed make babies, and that this Shiori was manipulating him like clay in her hands—him and Bijou both. They howled to seal their new understanding.\n\nCuriously, Queen Tam deemed that Shiori did have some redeeming qualities and exchanged pleasantries with her and Bijou—who suddenly vomited, saying it was *nothing*.\n\nWith that, the Queen retired for the day and went to her perfect slumber once again.",

She felt ready to go with her shield raised and blade in her hand.\n\nBut two fights left her with losses, and she had only one more chance to claim this unknown prize. Despite Elizabeth’s combat-ready skills as a knight, Nerissa struck her down without so much as a single mark left on the Witch.\n\nWith a laugh and praise, Elizabeth initiated a trade, passing over the [gorgeous ring](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=mzKgTVgZtwUq3Rxv&t=20334) she had purchased earlier in the day. Now, she had reason to give it along with a few excuses.\n\n---\n\n\n**A NOBLE KNIGHT'S STAY**\n\nWith victory achieved and a loss gained, there are talks of the Knight’s Suite as a prize for a sparring tournament. The very gift Nerissa secretly gave to Elizabeth. But it becomes painfully evident that Elizabeth has no idea the size of this room or that it’s not a room intended for sparring.\n\nQuickly, they make haste to Mordan Ramsey’s hotel to [inspect the room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=20591s) itself. Elizabeth is disappointed that it’s not what she reasonably expected. However, Nerissa and Elizabeth let their worries go as they embraced their inner child. Both jump on the bed before deciding it's best to stop before they break it.\n\n---\n\n**I'LL PROTECT YOU**\n\nWorry. Concern. Fear.\n\nA painting moved without a reason or an idea of who could have done it.\n\nMysterious music and ticking sounds were heard around the shop.\n\nBooks of confusion, feeling, and poetry are hidden behind Nerissa’s painting.\n\nNone of it sits well with the Jade Knight. Elizabeth turns to Nerissa and requests that she [stay in her LOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=22594s) for this night. Not to be alone.\n\n“Stay safe, okay?”\n\nA simple request for an unknown threat.\n\nOr perhaps the danger is right before the knight. Reflected in red eyes and odd intonations\n\n---\n\n\n**VERUM VOLUMEN**\n\nWhat exactly were their past identities? Their previous relationship? If Elizabeth was so insistent on Nerissa being a witch, was she actually one? Had Nerissa done something evil to the knight, so that her hatred transcended along with her in the present?\n\nThe growing curiosity of the black-haired maiden urged her to consult the memory of the other witch, Shiori of the Nyavella, whom she had commissioned a day ago to write something for her. Whether it was trustworthy or not, it did not matter. She had to cling onto something…\n\nShe promised that she would read it together with the fair knight, however, just to have some form of solace, she’d take a peek. And thus she [read](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=13021)…\n\nThe contents of the scroll told of a tale of a Knight and a Ravened one; the Knight accusing the Raven maiden, a witch, of presumably bewitching and casting hexes upon her. The Ravened One denied the allegations, citing she had only been kind to the rosen maiden; yet her words had fallen on deaf ears as the knight remained true to her resolve. She locked the witch away… in a cellar, where no one could hear her song apart from another prisoner…\n\nTroubled by such a story, she [called](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=13185) upon Lady Bloodflame, perhaps to inquire if she remembered any of it… if there was any truth to it. The fair knight, having received the call, made haste and read the same words written in the scroll.\n\nConfused, she denied it was factual and accused Shiori of telling lies. Indeed, there was no way she could do such a thing to her, could she? Even Nerissa believed she was a kind knight– a soldier of justice. She would make sure a just and fair trial had been put into place before she could pass judgment, surely? \n\nThe two hoped it was just make-believe... a figment of Shiori of the Nyavella’s imagination. \n\n---\n\n\n**THE OMEN**\n\nOverall, it had been quite a fun day… as they were able to spend time together and rekindle their relationship. Partly oblivious to the truth, they [slept](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=16262) the night together in Elizabeth’s quarters. The morrow shall be a good one…\n\n… Yet there lay the ominous books behind the portrait of the “witch”... seemingly foreboding of death and loss.\n\nWas it a prophecy? Or a retelling of the past? A mere fiction perhaps? We have yet to find out….",

            "content": "While Gonathon and Shiori were now on better footing than a day prior, a haze of tension continued to envelope the witch and knight. As with many of her companions, Gonathon’s first interactions with Shiori involved assisting her with upgrades and preparation, in this case, farming [enigmatic stones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=2465s). Before departing for the Cursed Tome event, Shiori requested Gonathon’s assistance with setting up an End of the World Party, which Gonathon happily agreed to help with. \n\nThe two would part ways for a while, with Shiori working on the party site and Gonathon assisting Immerkind with her romantic woes (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Knight at Home with the Wolves](#edge:cecilia-gigi)). It was during this time that Shiori would be confronted by Elizabeth. The scarlet knight had become enraged over the memories Shiori had sold, which she felt were fabricated. Now believing Shiori to be a scammer and manipulator, she becomes the most recent of many friends to warn Gonathon of her intentions. Immerkind, too, pleaded with Gonathon not to trust the witch, proclaiming her to be toxic and using the humble knight. Gonathon, not sure what to make of these accusations, explained that she and Shiori were on [neutral terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9716s), but lingering in such a state did not feel right. \n\n[Shiori is wrong about Gonathon pushing her.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9785s)\n\nConflicted over whether to believe her knightly mentor or the recalcitrant witch, Gonathon concluded that Liz deserved to be heard out and relayed her words to Tam Gandr (see: [Gonathon-Kronii: Passed Pawn](#edge:kronii-gigi)) and Immerkind. Unsure of Shiori’s intentions, but certain that Liz had no reason to lie, the three agreed to confront the red knight and witch. They needn’t wait long to hear Shiori’s side, for the two-toned witch invited the trio to the party site to talk. \n\nWhile the chief concerns of the gathering at first seemed to revolve around Shiori potentially being pregnant with Gonathon’s child following their hand-holding incident, Shiori’s actual reason for calling Gonathon went far deeper than any physical relationship. Pulling Gonathon aside and bathed in the moon’s radiant warmth, Shiori asked Gonathon about her Pearl and offered Gonathon a seemingly [simple choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=14956s): in exchange for a complete and clear snippet of a memory of her Pearl, Shiori’s memory of Gonathon would be wiped away. \n\n[We have gotten lost in each others' kindness](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15052s)\n\nThroughout their encounters, Shiori had time and time again admonished Gonathon for being overly reliant on others, for never making choices for herself, and always needing the approval of others to do anything. But here, with only the witch by her side, Gonathon made a [firm and resolute decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15125s) born of her feelings and beliefs: that it was not right for her to remember the Pearl if it meant forcing Shiori to give up her memories, and that above all else that she would not want her memories to be returned if others had to pay a price. She went on to apologize to Shiori for not being able to love the witch the way she wanted, and this caused Shiori to take a pause. Having heard Gonathon’s decision, the witch explained that she had [left a gift in her stall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15402s) before departing. \n\nWhile Tam attempted to convince Gonathon of Shiori’s duplicity and manipulation of others, the humble knight would not be swayed, and the exhausted queen and kindhearted retainer departed together. Now left alone, Shiori confessed that she had long made up her mind to relinquish her memories of Gonathon, and imparted the humble knight with one last message thanking her and requesting that she be true to herself.\n\n[The last rites of the humble witch](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17762)",

The two parted to assist their parties in the Mysterious Tome quest, during which a jovial Tam Gandr proudly proclaimed that Gonathon was [a truly great companion](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=1755) (this was quickly misinterpreted by her party members as Tam praising Gonathon as a good pet). \n\nDestiny would not keep the queen and knight apart for long, as Gonathon once again offered to assist Tam in winning the music disk from Star Site: Chaos. Initially reluctant to attempt the dungeon once more due to past traumatic attempts, Gonathon insisted that things would be different this time. This [promise held true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12168s), as the humble knight and the party would easily win the prize the queen had sought. \n\nFrom here, intrigue would once again spark to life as Gonathon, Tam, and Immerkind would cram themselves into a [closet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12291s) to discuss an important matter: that Elizabeth had reason to believe Shiori of the Nyavellas was peddling false memories. By this point, Tam had become deeply protective of her knight and indignant towards Shiori’s apparent manipulations, and she strongly insisted that the trio side with Liz. Gonathon, on the other hand, was not so sure, and finding themselves at an impasse (and following yet another instance of Gonathon seeking to spare Tam further embarrassment of HPO’s misdeeds), the three retired to write their journals. \n\n[There is no maid](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12744s)\n\nThey were stopped from doing so, however, by the wily Shiori, whose questions concerning Immerkind potentially dating Fia spiraled into a deranged and highly philosophical discussion on one’s state of being, the sense of self, and the meaning of love. When Shiori called upon Gonathon to inspect the party site, Tam was insistent on accompanying her knight. And when Shiori had finished presenting her bargain with Gonathon (see [Gonathon-Shiori: A Memory for a Memory, a Pearl for a Pearl](#edge:gigi-shiori)), Tam confronted her knight once more. Having witnessed the extent of Shiori’s apparently machinations, the queen stated in no uncertain terms [her belief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15572s) that the witch was manipulating and toying with the kind knight’s heart, just as she had done with others. Realizing that Gonathon had made up her mind about Shiori, a defeated Tam shared a tender moment with her loyal retainer, expressing a belief that at the very least, they would see the day through together. \n\n[Nothing can ruin this day!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15822s)",

Today though would prove to be the first time a chink would appear in her armor in the eyes of the humble knight, but would this be enough to foster distrust?\n\nThe two knights ventured into the Mysterious Tome quest together, with their wits and bond allowing them to lead their companions to victory. Walking together following their victory, the two encountered Nerissa Ravencroft, whom Liz desired to spar with. Although the raven witch offered for Gonathon to accompany them, a [feeling deep inside the humble knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=4864s) told her it was better to give them some time alone, and proclaimed she would meet with her fellow knight later.\n\n[A wolf is a good companion!](#embed:http://youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=3914s)\n\nSoon after, Liz would request Gonathon’s aid in an urgent matter. A strange music had been seeping out from underneath her forge, and she was unsure of its origin. The keen-eyed junior knight quickly discovered a secret passage underneath the Jade Forge, one emblazoned with a mural of Nerissa (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)). There, the knights and Roa discovered a chest containing a poem, one that appeared to be significant to the scarlet knight. Liz further showed off her [LOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=7601s): Liz Out of Office, but grew defensive when asked why there was only one bed. Leaving Liz to ponder the poem they found, Gonathon was unaware that the next time they would speak would be under very different circumstances. \n\n[Alas poor Bae, I knew her well, Immerkind](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=6829s)\n\nWhile Gonathon assisted Immerkind with her troubles (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Knight at Home with the Wolves](#edge:cecilia-gigi)), the scarlet knight made a disturbing discovery: that Nerissa had been given memories by Shiori of the Nyavellas that appeared to portray Elizabeth jailing the raven witch. Enraged by what she perceived to be a falsified memory, Elizabeth confronted Shiori and, realizing her connection to Gonathon put the humble knight in danger, [called Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9409s) and informed her of Shiori’s deeds. \n\nGonathon now stood very conflicted. On the one hand, she deeply trusted her fellow knight and saw no reason why she would falsely accuse Shiori. But on the other hand, she could not bring herself to suspect Shiori, and could not help but question exactly what Liz was up to and why she only had a single bed for her LOO. Gonathon, Tam Gandr, and Immerkind all agreed to [confront](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12902s) Liz and determine once and for all what motivated the stalwart knight’s heart. \n\n[Immerkind has an...interesting theory](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12645s)",

If saving the world and, ultimately, the universe was ever going to happen, it had to be today.\n\nThis was the day our heroes confronted their ultimate task: to destroy the Heart of Ruin, the very reason they had come to this world. All 15 gathered together, united in purpose, ready to face the so-called final boss... or so they thought.\n\nThings didn’t go as smoothly. Some fell to curses, turning against their own, forcing the others to bring them back from the brink. Only then did the true antagonist reveal itself—the creeping evil that had long poisoned the land and now threatened to consume all. And even when they triumphed, there lingered an unease, a feeling that this wasn’t truly over. Something still felt... off.\n\n![The battle against The Curse](/images-opt/curse.webp)\n\nBut for now, their mission was complete. And so came the time for resolutions.\n\nBittersweet closure found its way into Gonathon and Shiori’s story. An unexpected wedding tied together a certain cat lady and her feline partner, Shakira and Roa. A surprisingly heartfelt display of brotherhood emerged between Gonathon and Peasant Bae. Even Elizabeth and Nerissa, for once, shared something more than a witch-themed bickering exchange. Progress—real progress—was made, all rooted in one thing: bonds, connection, and reconciliation.\n\n...Well, almost all.\n\nOne storyline stood defiant in its absurdity.\n\nIn a day full of meaningful moments, a gender reveal party somehow stole the show in the most chaotic way possible. Yes, Miss Hot Pink One struck again—introducing yet more insanity to the kingdom with her ambiguous stomach situation. While others were weaving connections and building bridges, she was... doing the exact opposite. Her logic remained a mystery, one that seemed less like a riddle and more like a dare to comprehend.\n\n![The Pink One's ~~gas~~ gender reveal party](/images-opt/gender.webp)\n\nStill, one day remains.

            "content": "**Are You Okay?**\n\nAnother day, another journal. Elizabeth is worried about keeping *someone* safe. Yet when she looks at Thorn and strikes at the enemy, it cuts differently now. Flashes of ink splashed across a page seared into her memory. Thoughts of accosting someone without cause, without jury, without...justice.\n\n***Which home do you want to go back to?***\n\nWith the start of her day, Elizabeth takes a brief moment to admire the sunrise before the call of the ominous music returns. She lets out a heavy sigh, tired of hearing this tune. She worries about her sister Mococo and the pretty kitty Roa.\n\nThat entices her to pull her phone out and call Roa, asking if she was okay due to how upset she seemed yesterday. It doesn't take much for concern to take over when Roa states she feels ill and her stomach is still upset from being cursed. Swiftly, the Jade Knight buys and provides the other with a coin slime tart and a chocolate cake at the cost of nearly 300 of her coins.\n\nAs the two chat, Nerissa shows up, causing the fur on Roa's tail to stand up. Bloodfumble makes herself known again when Nerissa admits that she [stayed the night](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=854) in Lady Bloodflame's room. Offering the same to Roa with Nerissa in the room only infuriates and frustrates Roa and causes her to run off.\n\n\"I wonder why Roa doesn't trust Rissa.\"\n\nOnce again, that damned ominous music returns. Nerissa had said she was fine, Elizabeth mumbled to herself (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Forget or Forgive](#edge:liz-nerissa)). Still, she worries and rushes next door, calling for Nerissa multiple times before breaking down the door.\n\nAs a knight, it's her *duty* to protect. She has to do this. Elizabeth needs to know that the Witch is safe!\n\nYet inside the house, tucked into the corner, is a trapdoor that draws her eye, just barely peeking out above the ground. Scared of something deeper and darker, she quickly descends below. Her feet rush through the tight halls until she's face-to-face with the truth.\n\n[A jukebox.](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=2065)\n\n***A trick.***\n\n\"Being played a fool. What a foolish knight I am.\" Elizabeth whispers to herself.\n\n\"She was low the other day and was just playing a trick on me to make me feel better,\" Elizabeth lies to herself. \"I will see the brighter side.\"\n\nEven so, she worries. *Is Ravencroft okay?*\n\nOnce again, Roa appears next to the knight, her disdain for the Witch directly making itself known. Yet Elizabeth still, despite the trickery, defends Nerissa. She informs Roa that Shiori is the dangerous one. The story given to Nerissa painted Elizabeth more as a villain than a hero—someone cold, callous, and terrible.\n\nThings unbecoming of a knight.\n\n***F̵o̵r̸ ̷J̸u̸s̶t̴i̷c̵e̶-̴***\n\nShaking her head, Elizabeth makes her way back to the forge, where she takes a brief moment to talk to the Mighty Phoenix, making a note in the back of her mind to gift flowers to her business partner. Moving to her basement puts Elizabeth face-to-face with the memories of the unknown framed upon her wall.\n\nGathering some wood and coal, she makes it to the edge of the woods and starts a campfire. Holding the memories, Elizabeth scoffs and [tosses them into the flames](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=5712).\n\n***O̴̠͋h̶͇͂,̴͙̕ ̵͚͋t̴̠́h̷̄ͅè̴̟ ̵̢̈́m̸̫̄ẽ̵̟m̷̟͒o̷̥̓r̸̜̓i̸͚͝ȅ̷̤s̴̹̅.̵̝͌ ̴͚̾Ĕ̵̥v̷̟̆ě̶̗ṙ̵̪y̷̤̆ȍ̶͎n̸͇̓e̸͙̋ ̵̠̍ẘ̶͜ǎ̴̦n̶͈̉ţ̵̍s̶̱̏ ̶͕̂ẗ̸͈́o̶̤͑ ̶̼̈́b̶͍͝ę̴̐ ̶̥̓m̷̰̍ỵ̶͐ ̶͌͜ȇ̶̯n̴͕͐e̷̮̔ḿ̶͎ỳ̷̳.̵͓̋***\n\n*I won't let these memories hurt Nerissa. These lies and scams.*\n\nShiori tries to approach Elizabeth more than once, but the strong knight ignores her and walks on past without a word. She has to focus on the dungeon—on saving Libestal.\n\nStepping into the dungeon with everyone else simultaneously to face the final boss together, they instead face something even more terrifying.\n\nElizabeth must face her friends. Must face...Nerissa.\n\nWithout warning, Elizabeth loses control of her own body. Nerissa giggles sweetly in her ear.\n\n['*Hello. Lady Bloodflame.*'](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=8923)\n\nThen suddenly, Nerissa is ejected out of her just as quickly as it happened. The Curse strikes out at them before they even have time to discuss what happens. Fighting against being wrapped and bound by the creature, the group wins. To finally defeat this evil that stained the Kingdom of Libestal.\n\n***D̵o̴ ̶y̵o̷u̴ ̷w̴a̶n̴t̸ ̶t̷o̶ ̸g̴o̴ ̶b̶a̵c̴k̷?̸***\n\nOnce free, she spots Roa with Shiori again and approaches, warning her about the evil Witch. Again, she is questioned about which one is truly the evil one: Shiori or Nerissa?\n\nYet despite that question, she asks Nerissa if she's okay after the dungeon. Again, she's asking Nerissa if she's OK. Is it the third time today? The fourth?\n\nA stop in the castle has her [staring at the paintings again](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=10221). Shiori. Nerissa. Bijou. Fuwawa. Mococo. Why are their photos together?\n\nWhy were those five possessed in the dungeon?\n\n***Ⱨ₳Ɽ฿ł₦₲ɆⱤ Ø₣-***\n\nIn need of celebration, Elizabeth purchases a few supplies and returns to the forge, working on creating fireworks for the upcoming and somewhat questionable party. While working, [Nerissa stops in](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=10432) to visit her and chat.\n\nElizabeth makes a few blue fireworks for Nerissa and red ones for herself. After a failed attempt at testing them during the day, Nerissa makes a suggestion.\n\nA trip together to the onsen.\n\nYet again, Roa shows up, and Elizabeth Bloodfumble returns full force. Nerissa walks off as Elizabeth offers to have all three attend the onsen together. Something Nerissa or Roa seems too keen on. Somewhere along the way, she loses Roa and searches for Nerissa, finding the onsen she wasn't aware of.\n\nWith the other already in the steamy and hot water, Elizabeth undresses and removes her helmet as she climbs into the opposite side, unaware of wandering eyes inside and outside the onsen.\n\nAfter spending time together in the onsen, the two quickly make their way to the event of the day.\n\nWith the... Gas party underway, Elizabeth finds herself at Nerissa's side throughout the entire thing. Even sharing a picnic.\n\nWalking back to the forge after the party, she takes a moment to [stare at the burning memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=13731). Once again, she finds herself face-to-face with Nerissa.\n\n[\"You're also pretty too.\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?si=038e-vGsvZvwxgJe&t=13938)\n\nIt comes out vocally this time. It's not a thought inside Elizabeth’s head—an admission of something.\n\n***A͓͓̽̽r͓͓̽̽e͓̽ ͓̽Y͓͓̽̽o͓͓̽̽u͓̽ ͓̽O͓͓̽̽k͓̽a͓͓̽̽y͓̽?***\n\nAgain, the question spills from her lips. Again, Nerissa says she's fine in that honeyed tone. Smiling, Elizabeth says they will talk on the morrow.\n\nBut Kiara comes with a warning. [Something to heed](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=15003).\n\nCalling Nerissa a witch. Saying she casts curses. It's a horrible thing to do that might chip away at the other. It doesn't matter if Elizabeth thinks she is a good witch. She should apologize.\n\nBut is it a warning too late?\n\nIf a witch is fated to be a witch... Then a witch she shall be.",

Nevertheless, this powerful phoenix was keen on catching up. Shakira quickly got in touch with Immerkind, who updated the Lorekeeper on the status of her connection with the princess.\r\n\r\nLiz's sugar mommy was in for a surprise. Liz led Shakira into a fragrant room brimming with roses. Of course, _it was all platonic for her._\r\n\r\n[Counted all 31 roses in German!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=WEPtJx1R5jje3zOQ&t=5400)\r\n\r\nWhat did all these roses imply, one might wonder? Love? Marriage? If so, they certainly weren’t pointing toward anything between Shakira and Elizabeth. Instead, they seemed to hint at something far more unexpected—something blossoming between her and a certain other lady. Someone she hadn’t really interacted with much, yet still adored deeply. Why? Because she was a cat, of course.\r\n\r\nRegardless, things were looking bright for Shakira. She’d helped Fuwawa with her cozy little café—something the fluffy one was [immensely grateful](https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=vEe1MwWo-G92o61N&t=7708) for. She’d helped [save the world](https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=k8ITOhctAgqchF4l&t=9334), just as they were all tasked to do. And this time, she’d been more involved in everyone’s chaotic antics. Compared to her previous journey, this one had gone surprisingly smoothly.\r\n\r\n[The gassy party](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=kvQVbcOUu1hlwAx6&t=12015)\r\n\r\nWith the fate of the world now settled, it was time for Shakira to seal her own future. Those roses from before? The gassy party? If romance were ever going to bloom for her, it would be now.\r\n\r\nShe met with Roa—a pink cat—and after a heartfelt exchange, the two tied the knot (see [Shakira-Roa](#edge:raora-kiara)).\r\n\r\nLater, she journaled the day’s whirlwind of events, right before the final day arrived.\r\n\r\n[Liebes Tagebuch!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=SDhiMcfQ4LxQdVG1&t=15145)",

            "title": "Peasant Da Bae",
            "content": "The Peasant The Bae's day began once again. Soon, it will be her final day in this strange foreign land wherein she had seen many ups and downs in her life; hopefully, today will end in the peaks of romance. Cecilia Immerkind. And apparently, an It's Gas! party.\n\nBae was elated and nervous as she and [Cecilia spoke](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=323). It's been a while, and soon they'll make their way into the final stages of their adventure. To hopefully hint at her intentions, Bae asked if they could save the world together (in exactly 24 minutes), to which Cecilia would respond enthusiastically. Though if she caught the intent behind the words, it wasn't shown.\n\nA brave Hero Bae may have become, she became a mother as well. She still has to [finish the room for Khaos and The Other One](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=489). Perhaps she can add a small decoration to the room as well. One gacha box that the shopkeepers were selling had an opportunity to win a small figurine.\n\nAs she did her quests one final time, Bae fretted over Cecilia. She knew of the Kind Knight's passion and devotion to Princess Iphania, and it seemed she wasn't reciprocating Bae's hints. Doubt began to build up in Bae's heart. Mother, whoever 'Mother' is to Bae at this point, mentioned 'with love comes heartbreak,' and, indeed, Bae's endeavor would most likely end in failure. Was there a reason why she should go through with her confession? [Voices in her head spoke](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=783): Closure.\n\nShe called Gonathan, a comrade who had stuck by her through everything, though it seemed the knight was busy with his affairs in the morning. But they met soon enough at the wagon where they waited for others to begin the final leg of their journey. They refined their plan: Bae would send a call to Gonathan to signal she was ready by the [Bridge in the first Remnant field](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=1903), and Gonathan, when he received that call, would immediately bring Cecilia there.\n\n[The Queen has not risen!](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=1962)\n\nIt seemed there were still a few more people missing from their party, and Bae took this chance to [watch the rest mingle](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2160). Mordan announced her auction while the Hot Pink One and a few others were feeling ill. Immerkind was also quite nearby. And another person. The Hero, NinoIna. [Bae talked to Ina](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2395), telling the Hero of her admiration when they fought the first time, back in the illusory Libestal. How Ina fought on, her gallant back shining. Ina, flattered, reminded Bae: Fight for those you cherish.\n\nEnergized, Bae agreed. But doubts lingered. She pulled Gonathan aside, and the Good Knight reassured her that he believes Bae does have a chance. As if summoned, Immerkind came by. Bae and Gonathan immediately changed the subject, and Bae checked her inventory to find that her letter was missing. \n\n*Her letter was missing*... [in a safe place](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2645). It was merely in a chest in her PP Hole for safekeeping. She quickly took it with her and showed Gonathan the beginnings of the room she was excavating for her ~~daughters~~ sons. Gonathan would then bring up the chance that Iphania was Fia (a jest Shiori originally told Cecilia to mess with her.) Immerkind would not love the cat romantically, so Bae still may have a chance to win her heart.\n\nOn their way back to the wagon, Bae and Gonathan would hear the words \"raise...\" and the pieces began to connect: sickness, 'raise', and 'life-altering changes.' IRyS was pregnant.\n\n[But then Gonathan Raised Another Concern](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2782)\n\nBae paused. *Is* there anyone in the kingdom qualified to help with childbi-\n\nOh, Queen Tammy has awoken! The hero Ina took the lead, counting to ensure everyone was ready. It was time.\n\nA series of bookshelves were in the dungeon, with books that told of... betrayal? Evil laughter echoed from Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori. There was a strange glow to them as they flew. It is the **Advent** of our heroes' challenge as they must find a way to purify their friends and destroy the Ruination.\n\nThe books were meaningless; there were no hints, but soon Bae found they [must leave the room first](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=3246), where they now found themselves in a series of platforms filled with Stains. With each Stain defeated, the purification grew, but their cursed comrades would try to [sabotage them](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=3445). Eventually, they succeeded in saving their friends.\n\n[But there was a final challenge: The Curse](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=3693)\n\nIt was the fiercest opponent our heroes had faced, as thorns would erupt everywhere from the dungeon. Curses would hit them, almost blackening their hearts. But it did not matter; the heroes have come too far to let it win. Even as the Curse attempted to heal itself, it could not compete with the fierce attacks that rained down. \n\n[Libestal Saved](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4009)\n\nIt was over. Their journey has finally come to an end. The Outlander and Princess Iphania soon arrived, thanking everyone for overturning Fate and saying that Libestal was in their debt. But another sweet moment would be had: [The Princess took a fallen doll into her arms](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4051). The Curse they were fighting was a doll- [Fia](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4051). The last parting gift Iphania had given to [her father](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4192) before he left to fight. A gift that finally returned to the Princess.\n\nBut Immerkind's love for the Princess was so well-known that the others grew worried. Iphania and the Outlander had left together in a tender moment. Bae asked Gonathan how Cecilia fared and was surprised to hear that she was doing fine. Whether that was true or not, Bae was determined to go through with her confession.\n\n[Bae is Ready](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4438)\n\nIn an attempt to be romantic, Bae would tell her to look at the moon... that's no longer there, but Bae pushed through, finally [handing over the letter](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4542) she put all her hopes and dreams into. Cecilia read it, her voice faltered at the start as she read Bea's confession out loud. Then, flowers for Cecili. But before Cecilia would take it, she would ask Bae a few questions: Was this truly what Bae wanted? Would Bae's mother want her to jump for the closest person?\n\n[Yes, it is you.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4740)\n\n[Rejected.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4764)  \n\nThere was no need to mince words or prolong a painful moment: Bae's love was for naught, for Immerkind, though thankful for Bae's feelings, must follow her own heart for the princess. Cecilia will stay in Libestal, and perhaps, one day, she and Bae may meet again and then they can talk. They parted, once friendly companions now sorely strained.\n\nSwiftly, Gonathan was by Bae's side. He witnessed the events and Bae's heartbreak.\n\n[*Gonathan...*](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4887) \n\nIn the throes of despair, Bae would drown herself in the river by the bridge. A twisted foil to the events that transpired before, but instead of Cecilia, it was Bae, and instead of Bae, there was Gonathan.\n\n[You died... For me?](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4911)\n\nBae drowned and awoke to see that Gonathan had followed her fate. Touched but still in despair, Bae would repeat and repeat her drowning, Gonathan. Followed. Every. Time. Through the waters, through Mordan Ramsay having the most atrocious timing in this dramatic moment, Gonathan was there.\n\nThe pain echoed within Gonathan as he blamed himself. Bae couldn't bear to see Gonathan, the best knight she has ever known, do that to himself. \nBae knew. They all did. Immerkind's obsessive love was not subtle; in fact, it was rather like throwing a brick into a china shop. There was no need for Gonathan to take such a burden on himself when the truth was always open for all to witness.\n\n[Bae is a mother now](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5144)\n\nBae had responsibilities now. She had kids that she must provide for, Khaos and The Other One. \n\n[My Brother.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5214)\n\nThe flowers were always meant for someone Bae cared for, and who cared for her. It matters not anymore, love, to Bae. Her mother was right. Love brought pain and is unworthy of Bae's attention. There are more important matters: Her children, money, and her bro, Gonathan. With a toast to Bae's vow of celibacy under the light of the new moon, they solidified their newly forged Bromance, with a strong, firm handshake.\n\n[AWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOO](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5329)\n\n\nNow, Bae's troubles past her, it was time to witness the strange party everyone's been invited to. Queen Tam inquired about her well-being, and Bae immediately replied she felt great. Who was Immerkind? Love was unneeded. [A small misunderstanding occurred](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5550) but was immediately resolved. She would live for Brotherhood and her kids, introducing the Hot Pink One to her [abandoned nephew](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5633).\n\nThe party soon started... but of course, [drama followed](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5761). Bae watched, entranced, at the drama unfolding before her and followed along. \n\n[... Who was going to deliver the child?](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5883)\n\nIgnoring *that*, Bae would soon look for the Queen, [finding her in her rather mossy abode](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5936). After entering properly, Bae had to ask about the situation and learned that no, the Queen shall not be the godparent to the child, and the Queen's love is herself. She also learned that the Queen will be staying in Libestal and revealed that Bae herself would leave to find her box that blasted Charlie left somewhere. \n\n[The goddess](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=6239) would ask Bae where the Queen was, but Bae, on the promise of brotherhood, refused to say and would follow the group along. Eventually, the Hot Pink One gave birth. It's a gassy girl! [The less said, the better](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=6744). The baby is named Gasol-Ina and would immediately be thrown into a family drama that ended in a duel where her Brother would defend the Queen, and a dissection would occur on the Hot Pink One's abdomen.\n\nBut romance was not dead, for Bae would witness [a wonderful wedding](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=7715) between Kiara and Roa. After they took one last portrait for the questionable day, Bae would leave to fulfill her promise to her kids. A room. Oh, and [Gacha](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=8062).\n\n[After many attempts, 36 attempts today, Bae finally obtained 2 Stain figures from the gacha box](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=8199)\n\nFinally, Bae went to finalize the room for her children, Khaos and The Other One. Before long, it was done. Warm and comfortable, a bed for each with plenty of food supplied while Bae goes on her journey.\n\n[Kids' Room](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=9402)\n\n[And The Other One is named... Chaoz](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=9475)\n\nBijou called, and Bae was quick to invite her to see her child's room. Some music was also added too, a little entertainment for the children. Their Uncle Gonathan, too, came by to commemorate the moment.\n\nBut alas, with every high in life, there are lows, for [Bae was scammed](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=10289), and her endeavours in [fireworks did not spark colour in her life](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=11047).\n\nPerhaps the morrow would be a more joyous occasion for the Peasant The Bae.",

When the two mentioned they shared a room, though Elizabeth slept on the floor, it sent Roa spiraling; The bitterness from [Nerissa's rather catty comeback](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=823) also stung. Though Elizabeth tried to comfort her, Roa left, fervently calling Nerissa a witch before she drowned in despair.\n\nBut the determination, the delusion, was too strong, as Roa refused to give up on Elizabeth. Anger still coursed through her as she left for the Remnant fields to once again fight the Stains. Another session to destress. Only for it to come back when Nerissa was nearby. Luckily, so was [Mordan Ramsay, who offered free therapy](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=1407) to help Roa calm down.\n\n[Oh, it's so cute!](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=1786)\n\nPerhaps therapy was the way to go. Roa's mood was better as she marveled at the pretty decorations for the party tonight. Floating lanterns filled the sky as \"plates\" were already placed on the picnic blanket. Roa called Shiori to inquire what time the party would start, easily agreeing to help with the decorations after Shiori answered.\n\nDespite her pursuit of love, Roa was still the CEO of The Gacharms and managed her shop for a while. Their time in Libestal was coming to a close, but there was one more dungeon to face. People still needed better charms in the meantime. As she prepared, Cecilia passed by, and Roa asked if the smith could [upgrade her diamond pickaxe.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2457)\n\nWith a much better pickaxe in hand, Roa met Elizabeth outside the kingdom, where she warned Elizabeth to be careful of [the witch.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2753) While Elizabeth didn't quite understand Roa's vitriol against Nerissa, Elizabeth reassured the pretty kitty that she was a strong knight and that she could keep herself safe. That the real witch to be wary of was Shiori. [Roa disagreed.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2902)\n\nThe conversation would circle as they talked more about Shiori's story and Nerissa's imprisonment. Neither could agree with the other, one too mistrusting of Shiori's truth and the other too jealous to sympathize with Nerissa's past. But the matter was dropped, and [the mood shifted.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=3227)\n\n[A Pretty Flower for a Pretty Kitty.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=3262)\n\nFlustered by the gift, Roa left. She focused on picking flowers to use for the venue's decoration and soon returned when she had gathered enough. Back in Libestal, she saw Mococo, who, unfortunately, was still sick. Concerned, Roa gave her employee a bed to rest in and food to eat, wishing that she would get better soon.\n\nIn her shop, Roa encountered a few intruders lurking beneath the floorboards. It was just Gonathan and Nerissa. Roa followed them back to Gonathan's home, and for a moment, the two love rivals [had returned to being friends](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=4784)... until Lady Bloodflame's name was mentioned and Roa left.\n\n[Kiara asked if Roa was into her roommate.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=5697)\n\nKiara brought Roa back to the forge—the home the phoenix shared with Elizabeth—to show Roa her room. Dozens and dozens of roses filled the frames within, and all of the flowers were gifts from Elizabeth. Despite Kiara's reassurances that there was nothing going on between the roommates—they really were just roommates—[Roa left crying,](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=5845) upset that there was more competition for Elizabeth's love.\n\nBut Kiara was quick to follow her, giving [her pets](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=5878) and emphasizing she wasn't Roa's rival. The flowers Kiara received were a sign of **friendship** since she had never received one before. Boldened, Kiara would also ask Roa if the cat knew any single person looking for love since [she and her cousin didn't work out.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=6097)\n\n[A... Confession?](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=6352)\n\nIt seemed the cat and the bird had a miscommunication of sorts. They had admired each other since day one, but it seemed like work and adventures had kept them apart. Maybe in another time and world, [things would have been different for them.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=6423)\n\n[Stick of Love. How Romantic.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=6482.)\n\nAnd it seemed like others may have news of their own. [One beloved employee, for instance,](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=7981) Bijou, mentioned that she and Shiori might be expecting a surprise! Though the possibility of gas lingered, Roa congratulated Bijou and wished her and Shiori the best.\n\nSoon. The Final Battle was Here.\n\nAn Advent of betrayal occurred as Shiori, Bijou, the two unrelated demon dogs, and Nerissa were cursed. Friends (and Nerissa) [attacked them,](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=8643) and it was only after Roa and the others defeated the Stains in the next stage that the curse slowly receded. Before long, those possessed were purified.\n\nA single challenge now remained: The Curse. A battle hard fought as Roa dodged the thorns that grew from the ground and the flowers that sprouted out of nowhere. Eventually, they [overcame it.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=9248)\n\nThey did it.\n\nAfter seven long days, the adventures and battles were finally over. The Princess even found the doll she gave her deceased father—a doll that looked remarkably like Fia.\n\nBut there was one last battle for Roa to face. Her heart. Though she shared tender moments with Kiara, Elizabeth still held the apple of her eye. After some encouragement from Shiori, Roa would shoot her shot. Nervous, she talked to Elizabeth. The Red Knight noticed Shiori and Roa's conversation and reminded Roa to be wary of Shiori's true nature. Roa didn't understand Elizabeth's distrust of the writer but will nonetheless follow her wishes.\n\nIn a rather surprising turn of events, it seemed like Kiara was a forerunner for Roa's heart. Both of them spent more time together throughout the day and even [commissioned a memory and a story from Shiori.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=10472) Roa would cheer for Kiara as the Orange Knight dueled.\n\n[The Moment Roa's Heart Broke.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=11039)\n\nWith unrequited delusional love comes inevitable heartbreak. As Roa witnessed Elizabeth and Nerissa's date in the onsen, Roa knew her chances were gone. Perhaps she never had a chance in the first place. Roa needed a friend, and the first one that came to mind was Shiori. They met underneath Gonathan's tree, and Roa told Shiori of her pain. A love that ended with a whimper that the Red Knight never heard. Shiori comforted her, giving her pats as she reassured the cat that she would find someone much better one day.\n\nThough saddened, there was still a party to attend. The party that saw a new, gassy one born but [quickly lost.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12121)\n\nAmid drama between The Queen and the goddess, Kiara and Roa left to steal a moment away for themselves, heading towards the Great Hall.\n\n[A Proposal](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12664)\n\nIt was a whirlwind romance. A serendipitous realization that ultimately ended in an exchange of rings and...\n\n[A Wedding](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12940)\n\nAs they celebrated this wonderful occasion, Roa would pull Shiori and Bijou away to talk. Her new wife aside, both had helped Roa tremendously during her stay in Libestal. Roa shared [her determination](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=13224) to find her happiness with her own hands.\n\nShe talked of love lost and love found in her diary.\n\n## Fanart\n\n[Big Cat, Big Pains](https://x.com/fernrOreo/status/1923057970440536174)",

As such, it was time to venture into new things. Perhaps it was the thought of selling houses that could make a profit without the stress of having to deal with the emotions. But for now, the chef had to do her daily, mundane tasks of completing side quests, upgrading her revelation for the upcoming dungeon, and reading inquiry letters she had bought.\n\nAnd unknowingly, [she accidentally read one of Shiori’s letters addressed to Gonathon!](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=389)\n\nMordan panicked. Putting it back wasn't an option. She couldn’t openly give it to the humble knight either—that’d be awkward.\n\n[Evidence disposed.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=650)\n\nThe pink wolf encountered a disgruntled Roa, who had been upset by how much Nerissa was hovering around Elizabeth while killing stain monsters. Mordan listened to her and offered a free therapy session to lift the pink cat's spirits. This, _and her dwindling desire to keep chasing her chef dream_, led to Mordan reconsidering whether to continue her therapist career [full-time](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=1927) as _Doctor_ Mordan Ramsey—competing with Mococo's services in terms of quality.\n\nAfter that, Mordan began working on her real estate business. She sought an empty lot of land and claimed it. As she placed down her first brick, she thought auctioning new housing would market well to the homeless and the constipat- expecting families. Mordan's building process captured the eyes of her wolf pack and a few others who passed by—[even offering tours of the inside.](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=4571)\n\nBijou later informed Mordan [that Shiori was notified about the letter.](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=4673)\n\n---\n\nMordan ran a brisk trip with the rest of her fellow heroes into the _Heart of Ruin_. After they defeated _the Curse_, Mordan returned to build another BIGGER house.\n\nThe next big thing to do was to celebrate the Hot Pink One's gender reveal party, as she had been invited by Shiori a few hours ago.\n\nFamily drama between HPO, Tam Gandr, and Ina (see: [Ina-IRyS: Turning To Another](#edge:ina-irys) and [Ina-Kronii: Netorare](#edge:kronii-ina)) unfolds in front of the Lorekeeper.

            "title": "Shiori Nyavella",
            "content": "The events of yesterday were hazy in Shiori's mind, a strange feeling for someone such as her. Normally, she would be keen on the details, as a writer should, of course, but for now she felt... odd. Perhaps it was due to the quietness in the morning, or perhaps it was because today is their penultimate day in Libestal, and tomorrow's outcome depended on today's success.\n\nNonetheless, there was work to be done. As Shiori checked her shop, she noted that Mordan Ramsay had bought [something earlier](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=342), though, bemusingly, her items seemed to be untouched.\n\nShiori called Nerissa to talk and offered to bring some food as a courtesy, something simple. On her way to visit, Shiori saw Mordan constructing a few houses for an auction later on. It seemed that while the therapist-chef was still wary of Shiori, Mordan accepted the invitation to the party.\n\nAs Shiori neared Nerissa's humble house, music played in the air, leading down underneath a secret shrine, one decorated with Nerissa's portrait. Behind the picture was a collection of books that Nerissa owned. Not one to pass reading, Shiori skimmed them. They were fine.\n\nThe music, however, was too loud for Shiori's taste, and she offered to host Nerissa back at the home she shared with Bijou.\n\nAs they spoke, Nerissa mentioned that she had [regained her memories](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=892) from the previous chapter, in addition to the one she had commissioned Shiori the day before. Though Nerissa herself isn't sure if it's wholly accurate, she nonetheless trusted Shiori. There was no reason for Shiori to lie, after all. \n\nIt was nice to see that someone trusted her and acknowledged the value of her work. Unlike a certain Scarlet Queen. Nerissa guessed it was Elizabeth when Shiori mentioned what had occurred yesterday.\n\n\nFortunately, Nerissa understood the nature of painful memories. The difficulty in accepting a painful truth. A witch to a witch, sense of camaraderie between them was (re)born. They spoke more, gossiping about Lady Bloodflame's hypocritical faults that the knight didn't seem to notice.\n\n[In My Heart I Have Given Up.](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1065)\n\nThis surprised Shiori, but she approved of Nerissa's decision; it was probably the healthiest option—it was doomed yuri to begin with. There were too many suitors who tried to catch the Red Knight's heart, and while Nerissa's advances seemed to indicate something between the two, oftentimes it was for naught. Roa's name came up in the conversation as [Shiori's phone rang](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1096). It was Roa calling to confirm the timing for the constipation party later. Shiori would also invite Roa to help with the decorations before ending the call.\n\nLikewise, Shiori's talk with Nerissa soon came to an end, and they celebrated a new bond between them, one of Witches, a coven of witches. One, they might invite Shiori's Jeweled One into their fold.\n\nNerissa left, but soon after, Shiori realized she had forgotten to return her book. She quickly followed her now fellow witch only to witness a rather awkward scene: Nerissa and Elizabeth talking about Mococo stealing from Nerissa. After a quick return of the book, Shiori left. \n\nReminded about Bijou's health and the *possible* implications that it may be more than just gas that lingered in the Jeweled One, Shiori called her. Still sick, and it seemed that  Mococo caught this accursed virus as well. There might be quite a bug going around the village recently. Well, at least a party for constipation was set up, and whether Bijou would join her brother in unfortunate childbirth or simply be sick, Shiori would take care of her.\n\nAs Shiori hung up, she could hear Bijou... and another voice outside.\n\n[A familiar voice](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1732) \n\nAnother person was with Bijou, one who wore a distinctive orange jacket underneath the Libestan cloak. Once upon a time, Shiori knew her under a different name. \"His\" name was Gonathan G, and unlike before, Gonathan seemed to be a much different person. Calmer. Relaxed.\n\nAnd missing from Shiori's backlog. No memory of Gonathan remained in her, not from the previous nor the current chapter they're on. A memory unreciprocated, as Gonathan recalled speaking to Shiori yesterday, talking about an item Shiori had supposedly left for her to buy. And Bijou seemed to be aware of something as well, nudging Gonathan away to talk. When the two finished their conversation, a conversation that Shiori was careful not to accidentally overhear, [Shiori gave the Knight a small snack for later](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=2040), a small commemoration of their \"first\" meeting. \n\nAs the Orange Knight left, Shiori noted to Bijou that Mordan had bought something from her shop earlier. A Mordan that quickly found her way back to inquire about some basic bookkeeping mechanics before revealing how she accidentally bought the book meant for Gonathan, [mistaking it for the commission](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=2438) she requested from Shiori. Gonathan's journal was delivered safely to her home, at least.\n\nSatisfied that Mordan enjoyed her commission and after food was prepared for Bijou in case she felt sick, Shiori soon left for the newer Remnant field to finish some quests, asking Gonathan to join her as if it were natural. As if she had asked her about this before. There was a sense... of familiarity about her as Shiori spent time with the Knight.\n\n[Oh, thank you! That's very kind of you, Gigi](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=3283)\n\nGonathan was confused for a moment by Shiori's slip-up. Of course. She wasn't privy to the memories Shiori had. The only memories she recalled were the times of Libestal and not of before. Noting the [discrepancies](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=3369), Shiori moved the subject along, asking Gonathan about her story. She listened, witnessing a few silly moments the [Knight displayed](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=3745). Another memory to add to her archive.\n\n[A Sweet Moment Under the Stars](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4171)\n\n[Gonathan asked if the memories were painful... would she rather forget those?](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4297)\n\nIt seemed the Knight was more aware than she appeared to be. Perhaps, there were painful memories with \"Gonathan.\" Gonathan mentioned they talked many times like this, through the night until the sun rose once more. Shiori then asked if she, Gonathan, remembered her life before Libestal; would she still be the same? Gonathan pondered this for a moment, bringing up Queen Tam and Peasant The Bae, who, though they regained their memories, are still the same. Perhaps for Gonathan, it would be similar—she would just be more complete. \n\nHer thoughtfulness [rendered Shiori speechless](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4563). She couldn't find a word to label this bond between them, but maybe simple companionship was enough, Gonathan suggested. There was no need to rush or name this thing between [them at the moment](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4726).\n\nThe time for their last dungeon was soon. As Shiori prepped for their adventure, ruminating on her time with Gonathan, Shiori felt strange. The Knight was just too different from her former self. But speaking of others being unwell, Bijou and Mococo were still ill. The Hot Pink One, too, but she was most likely a different case.\n\n[***Ruined***](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6148)\n\nA voice called out to her. *Don't let anyone leave alive*. \n\nIt seemed it called out to Bijou, the demon dogs, and Nerissa too, as they all started to fly, mad laughter bursting forth from their throats, strange ruinous magic at their disposal... Shiori felt fine. She observed, picking up some books to add to her collection, as her once-group of criminals attacked their friends. \n\nShiori soon joined the ruined ones, casually attacking the heroes to play the role she was assigned. [Cursing one in particular with a vicious memory](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6446). She followed the others as they climbed up the platforms while fighting Stains and avoiding explosive attacks. \n\nLuckily, it seemed that this part of the role was over as the curse subsided. Another library was found, another book to add.\n\nFinally, The Curse.\n\n[That actually looked pretty attractive](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6687), but unfortunately, betrayal was limited only to the heroes that played the game, and soon Shiori was fighting against the boss, following the narrative written for the story. Thorns erupted from the ground as flowers appeared, but before long, victory was attained, [but at a cost](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6977). Albeit a temporary one, as Roa was soon back.\n\nExposition was soon upon Shiori as the Outlander and Princess Iphania appeared, thanking everyone as Libestal was finally free from its tragic fate, including a doll, one that looked remarkably like Fia. It was the doll that the previous King brought with him before he perished. A doll that was finally back in the Princess's arms.\n\nBack within the kingdom's walls, [Shiori pulled Roa aside](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7135) to ask her about her plans. Shiori encouraged Roa to pursue Lady Bloodflame today and gifted her some food to win the Red Knight's affection. \n\nBut there was a party to check on. Shiori was impressed by [Fuwawa's catering](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7271), showering her with compliments. The decorations were also well done; flowers were also beautifully planted around, accentuating the venue even more. Bijou also seemed to be doing well; the gas, the curse, had dispersed earlier.\n\nIn the midst of the preparations, and for some reason, Shiori found herself cooking potato salad again. It seemed she had a taste for it today. Shiori called Gonathan to inform her that she had found a letter of hers and to ask if Gonathan could meet her. They met at Gonathan's tree. [Shiori accidentally eavesdropped on a rather touching conversation](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7930). She watched the happy couple talk, waiting for them to finish before telling them that preparations for the party were soon to be completed and that a bed was added to accommodate the birth.\n\nDisturbed again, this time by Roa's call. A commission for memories from Roa and Kiara. Fanfiction and memories. Roa's memory would be randomised, and Shiori would speak to Kiara about the story later, a [\"spicy\"](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8350) one of her and Roa. Shiori reassured them the memories will be delivered to their homes when she is done. \n\nFinally, she met Gonathan near his home, [and both of them shared potato salad](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8542), Gonathan mentioning another memory Shiori couldn't recall. One where Shiori had given him the first potato salad she had made. A memory was told to her instead of the other way around.\n\n\nThe party was ready, the guests were there, and they were ready to start. But some things didn't go according to plan as [the Hot Pink One was in labor](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8883). In the meantime, Roa called to tell Shiori of her horrible day, and Roa had given up. It seemed that the Raven one was too close to Elizabeth for her to truly have a chance. [Shiori comforted Roa](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=9126). Roa thanked Shiori for her kindness.\n\n\n[Yay! It's a Gassy Girl!](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=9716) The Hot Pink One had given birth! And the ~~chick~~ baby [was gone too soon](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=9845), by the Fuzzy One's claws. Literally. Fire was burning the picnic blanket as another fight broke out between the guests. Finally having had enough, [Shiori stepped away](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10172) to start the last diary entry.\n\nIn the Library, Shiori met Ina, who seemed upset. The Hero didn't know, and didn't care, that her child had tragically passed away just 10 minutes ago. The Hot Pink One's affairs and infidelity had come to light for the Hero to see, something that Shiori vouched for by how rather... affectionate the goddess was to others. \n\nThe sombre affair was soon cast aside for Roa and Kiara's wedding! Shiori walked Roa down the aisle as Kiara waited at the end, with Elizabeth as her best maid. Ina officiated their marriage, and it seemed that there would be at least one happy romance in this chapter. \n\n[Group Photo! Huzzah!](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10859)\n\nRoa beckoned Shiori and Bijou closer to [share her determination to find her happiness with her own paws](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10949) as her new wife, Kiara, watched proudly a few tables away. Shiori congratulated the happy couple once again and promised Kiara that, once completed, the commissions would soon find their way to them. Swept up by the flow, Shiori shared her feelings with Bijou. That their relationship was unbalanced by what Shiori remembered and what Bijou couldn't. It wasn't entirely honest.\n\n [But That Didn't Matter. Bijou presented her with a ring of Promise](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11132) \n \nBijou promised Shiori that she would be the only one Bijou would love. They will take it slow, and when the time comes to talk, they shall. Shiori accepted.\n\n[Our Home, Gothrock](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11372)\n\nA ring now framed upon their door, the precious blue flower in front of their home. A swift kiss from Bijou before she swiftly fled. A series of tumultuous events, Shiori noted as she finished her diary. Soon, Nerissa visited while Bijou brought her brother, the Hot Pink One, to chat. Bijou excitedly joins Shiori and Nerissa in their coven as a witch-in-training.\n\n \n[***Betrayal***](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11957)\n\nAs Shiori submitted her diary for the day, she spied one of her previous entries, one titled \"Betrayal.\" An entry written with pain gained from someone with a noble and pure heart. It detailed the Knight's anger, Shiori's sorrows, and ultimately the decision to move on from their relationship. There may have been more to this story; with that in mind, Shiori called Gonathan to ask. They met in the Library, where Shiori read her entry to Gonathan—[Though they couldn't seem to find a private place to talk](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=12352). \n\nNot everything in Shiori's entry was true; there may have been anger, but Gonathan would never hurt Shiori like that. Shiori learned the truth, Gonatha's truth, of that day and the nature of her and Gonathan's relationship. Of Gonathan's hastiness and then the Knight's hesitancy to continue this romance. Shiori thanked her, and Gonathan continued that Shiori was kind, even yesterday. Though her memories were gone, [something lingered in Shiori whenever she met Gonathan](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=12655). It was a bittersweet memory, and Shiori left, crying as she did.",

Surprisingly, she didn't look bothered; in fact, it rather seemed intentional that she allowed them to find it.\n\nAs if it were an invitation to a baptism of a transformed being.\n\n---\n\n[CORRUPTION](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=8881)\n\nSo far, all of the dungeons had been conquered but one– the Heart of Ruin– the source of ruination, corrupting the whole of Libestal. \n\nThe heroes prepared, making sure they were fully equipped to ensure victory.\n\nAnd when the time was right, they entered the dungeon…  Until… \n\nNerissa noticed something was different.  She had been corrupted! Yet she was not alone, as a few other members-- Shiori of the Nyavella, the Fuzzy One, the Fluffy One, and Princess Bijou-- had been infected by the stains as well. \n\nHow they were chosen was unknown. One thing was clear, however: it was beyond their control, and it was up to their friends to save them… or, perhaps, take their lives if worse comes to worst.\n\nAnd as expected of the heroes, they did their best in winning their friends back as they attempted to purify them.\n\n---\n\n**SOMETHING PERSONAL?**\n\n\nFate was such a trickster. Having been possessed, the corruption guided Nerissa to [haunt](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9100) Roa Pandora, enabling her to see through the secrets of her heart. The corrupted “witch” finally confirmed and confronted her about the woman’s growing feelings for Lady Bloodflame and the jealousy she harbored for her blossoming relationship with Lady Bloodflame.\n\n*“You stole the red knight”*\n\n*“I stole no such thing,”* she quipped back. \n\n*\"You... evil witch! I knew you were evil from the very beginning\"*\n\nRoa Pandora struggled in fighting for her sanity, while the raven one laughed at her demise. \n\nAfter quite some time, the big cat was finally able to get out of her possession… Only at the cost of another person— [Lady Bloodflame](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9228).\n\n\n---\n\n**THE FIRE THAT PURIFIES?**\n\n*“Come to your senses!”* the knight shouted.\n\n*“Come to my senses?* I think I came to those a long ago”\n\nIt did not take long for the valiant knight to overcome the possession. Was it because of divine protection?  Perhaps the “witch” has learned the red maiden’s true feelings by entering her mind and so could not truly hurt her? Maybe it was the blue flames of the scarlet warrior that consumed the corruption?\n\nBefore they knew it, the pure knight had [\"cleansed\"](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9259) Nerissa and won her over to their side again.\n\n---\n**THE HEART OF RUIN**\n\nYet, such was just the beginning... As the heroes had yet to face the heart of Ruin and bring to an end the evil it had caused. \n\nEntering the [final](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9412) dungeon, the warriors fought in all their might, side by side,  even those that had been corrupted once. Together, with their own skills and the power of their bonds, the Shining Stars had successfully defeated the The Curse, saving the world once more... \n\n---\n**SHATTERED MIRROR**\n\n\nDespite all the celebrations, Nerissa couldn’t seem to find the same joy she had from the beginning. \n\nShe had already been purified, right? And yet… her heart still felt empty as a [void](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=14765). As if there was a growing shadow engulfing all the light and happiness within her. As if buried in eternal winter, her soul became numb. Perhaps, devoid of love, even.\n\n*“You see, my heart is still dyed black.”*\n\n*“I have no intention of ‘saving’ anything.”*\n\nThis looming darkness, wherever its roots came from, she finally embraced as her own. Whether it was just an illusion or the reality, it mattered no longer. \n\nShe had accepted this form. \n\nThe monster that had been trapped in the mirror has finally broken free. \n\nAfter all, *NOTHING STAYS PURE*...",

            "content": "It is the day of the gas reveal, but preparations are still in order. Bijou shares her recent conversation with others, which leads them to believe that perhaps it's just [constipation](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=y5yjkh4NAX9clGIW&t=399), or perhaps a weird virus; only time could tell. Still, she desired to meet her beloved, and Shiori wanted to give her food, so they agreed to meet at the archiver's house.\r\n\r\nBut upon reaching the archiver's door, she's first met with Gonathan G. While Bijou has learned she has to trust Shiori, her mind still inevitably goes to maps as they talk, but it quickly becomes apparent to her that the archiver has no recollection of him. This forces her to intervene and have a private chat with the knight. Bijou tells him that Shiori was considering temporarily deleting her memories of him, and now she knew that it worked.\r\n\r\n[Well this is awkward](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=TuIqi8kS_tcjKH5u&t=851)\r\n\r\nOnce Bijou notices that her onii-chan woke up, she immediately wants to show her the [preparations](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=ASbpOoYyeE-xFFaZ&t=3584) for the party, and HPO notices that the sign saying \"ITS GAS\" is too visible, so Bijou takes it upon herself to hide it.\r\n\r\nAs she's placing the final touches, people are gathering at the wagon to face the Heart of Ruin. It takes some time for all of them to gather, and in the meantime, Roa and Fuwawa report the same stomachache as Bijou and Mococo. Bijou goes back to Gacharms to prepare and in there she confides to Roa that Shiori and her exchanged a seed and an egg, and the last time that happened, Khaos was born. Roa is completely taken aback by this development.\r\n\r\n_\"IT COULD BE GAS, IT COULD BE GAS THO, I CAN'T TELL\"_\r\n\r\nAnd in the end... It was not gas... Nor a pregnancy but a secret third thing. The Curse. The curse has inflicted Shiori, Fuwawa, Mococo, Nerissa, and Bijou.\r\n\r\n[May the lands burn](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=59l0U4sYULFe2bYR&t=5230)\r\n\r\nThrough its powers controlled their minds and forced them to attack and hunt their allies, but with the combined power of the heroes from beyond the stars, they managed to purify them.\r\n\r\nOnce reunited on the same side, the girls found themselves in a library again, and in front of them was the Song of Ruin. Was Princess Iphania... Evil...? Bijou worries about Immerkind's feelings, but there was no time left before they had to fight The Curse.\r\n\r\nWith the power of the revelations in one hand and the potato in the other, the heroes manage to defeat the formidable foe and [save Libestal](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=MuH6a3gYsGGU4iHY&t=6043) from the stain. They quickly meet with Princess Iphania, and there is no betrayal this time; they have done it, they've changed fate. And as they're speaking, they notice a doll next to them, the same doll Iphania has given to her father, and one they were familiar with, Fia.\r\n\r\nImmerkind seems to be doing okay, and so is Fia at the Library. This left them puzzled, but without more hints to go by, they decided to wait for the banquet for answers. Now, there was something way more important to them, Bijou's onii-chan's pregnancy/gas reveal party.\r\n\r\nThe picnic starts innocently enough, there is food, decorations, fireworks, music, and happy guests. The Hot Pink One manages to confess her feelings to Nino Ina, her eternal consort, and she feels the same.\r\n\r\nAs they are all gathered to see the miracle of birth and/or the liberation of gas, Bijou starts to reveal the sign hidden in bricks, and they all can see it says \"ITS GAS\". Not only is it gas, but, as she also tells everyone, the pink wool behind reveals it's a girl, a gassy girl!\r\n\r\n[It's Gas!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=oFCqx7ndLwdT4gdb&t=8748)\r\n\r\nSadly, things quickly go south. As the baby is taking her first steps, Mococo kills her, and HPO is heartbroken and finds herself in denial. Then, soon after, a fight erupts between Bijou's stepmother, Queen Tam Gandr, and her onii-chan (see [Hot Pink One-Tam](#edge:irys-kronii)).\r\n\r\n[Maps...maps... I love maps...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=i-m4qvVv7hVV7F09&t=12638)\r\n\r\nBijou finds herself lost in this conflict; she realizes her sister is leaving her onii-chan, and a duel is set between Gonathan and The Hot Pink One, with concerning stakes. If the princess' brother were to lose, someone would have to cut open her stomach. With no one else willing to fulfill this task, Bijou decides to take it upon herself... Maps... Maps... Maps... Maps are the only true...\r\n\r\nAnd so, the duel starts. And while the goddess tries her best, she quickly finds out she's no match for the knight, and it is time for her punishment. Bijou gets close to her onii-chan and starts the excruciating process, she cuts, and cuts, and cuts. Reaping everything out, making sure there is nothing left inside. And at the end of this, she finds inside a single thing... A... Soul...? Alcohol...?\r\n\r\n[Girl you got that in you?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=gbQWcwUyuRlq2Gzd&t=9631)\r\n\r\nThere's little time to think about it, because a wedding was going on at that moment between [Shakira and Roa](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=pz0kfmf9vTMEW-NB&t=9791) Pandora, huzzah! What a joyous occasion! However, Bijou is a bit confused, as she thought her boss was interested in Lady Bloodflame.\r\n\r\nThey have a quick talk, and Roa tells the princess that she has decided to seek what was best for her and find someone who had eyes for her. This inspired Bijou.\r\n\r\nShiori seeks her out, she wants to talk about the future. Bijou desires to be with her, but the witch expresses worries of taking advantage of her, as the princess has not yet regained all her memories.\r\n\r\nWithout time to lose, Bijou runs to buy a ring, a ring not to propose, but to promise her beloved that, no matter what, she only has eyes for her. Bijou doesn't mind being used, as long as they can be together. And Shiori accepts the ring.\r\n\r\n[Rock hard again](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=ti6H09S9SrEnuLNp&t=10106)\r\n\r\nThey teleport to the witch's house, set the ring on display, and rename it to The Home of Gothrock, as they will now live together.\r\n\r\nBijou leaves her home once more to talk with her onii-chan, which led the little princess to stand in the middle of the conflict between her step mother and her brother once more. Tam, deciding she no longer wishes to keep wasting her time arguing, leaves, leaving Bijou and The Hot Pink One alone.\r\n\r\nIs it then that her brother is determined to convince Bijou the princess that the queen only desires to use her. However, Bijou is reluctant to believe this.\r\n\r\n[Jaslighting](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=fuv5o4ggw4tby11g&t=13403)\r\n\r\n_\"If that is the case, (that you can soothe any conflict) why is the case that conflict follows you everywhere you go, onii-chan?\"_\r\n\r\nWithout being able to choose a side, Bijou can only run and cry. Why must the people she loves fight? Why must there be conflict everywhere? Bijou did not know, the only thing she knew for sure...\r\n\r\nIt was maps. Maps maps maps maps maps maps maps maps.\r\nMaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaps.",

            "title": "Gonathon G",
            "content": "A New Start for a Weary Heart\r\n\r\nThe day started like any other, with Gonathon doing the rounds and visiting his companions. However, upon arriving at Shiori’s home, the humble knight was met with a sobering discovery: the witch he had grown close with now had no memories of him, and greeted Gonathon as a stranger. For most others, such a revelation would leave them numb or furious. But the humble knight responded only with a gentle greeting, along with a brief explanation of who he was. Perhaps somewhere deep in his mind, he recalled going through this situation before, and was used to it. Or maybe he accepted Shiori’s choice as justified. Whatever the reason, after a brief conversation with Bijou and Shiori, the melancholic knight learned that Mordan Ramsey had mistakenly purchased the book and hurried off to find her.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the absent-minded therapist had quickly realized her mistake and left the book for Gonathon at the knight’s treehouse. Cradling the book in his hands, Gonathon read it and learned of the items Shiori had hidden for him at the back of her tree. Swiftly collecting them, Gonathon had no time to read them as Shiori—now calling Gonathon “G”—contacted him for assistance in the newest resource area, a request Gonathon was happy to oblige.\r\n\r\nMeeting up with the amnesiac archiver (see [Gonathon-Shiori: The Moon Sets So the Sun May Rise](#edge:gigi-shiori)), the two shared a tender scene in which Gonathon reminded Shiori of their experiences together and Shiori talked about Gonathon’s true self, the one known as “G.” Watching the sun rise together, the two promised to meet again and parted ways. For matters of the heart would have to wait; the Heart of Ruin had to fall!\r\n\r\nGathering with the other adventurers, Gonathon briefly talked with Peasant the Bae about her plan to propose to Immerkind. As more and more of his friends arrived, Gonathon was gifted many powerful items for the upcoming quest, each one a symbol of the relationships the humble knight had forged in the past week. With the tardy Tam Gandr finally making an appearance, the fellowship of smiths, cooks, suppliers, and charm makers descended together into the darkest of dungeons. Through many hard-fought battles there, Gonathon helped to purify his friends and ultimately slay the malignant Curse, seemingly saving the kingdom as well.\r\n\r\nReturning triumphantly, Gonathon now faced his next quest: assisting Bae (see [Bae-Gonathon: A Bromance of Eternity Borne Under the Light of the New Moon](#edge:bae-gigi)). Directing Immerkind to the fated bridge, Gonathon listened in as Immerkind swiftly rejected Bae, leaving the brokenhearted peasant still clutching the flowers meant for the princess-obsessed doll. Upon realizing Bae intended to drown herself, the mortified Gonathon leaped into action, succumbing to the murky depths of the ocean with the peasant several times as he pleaded with her to reconsider. Finally seeing the light, Bae swore an oath of brotherhood with Gonathon, solidifying another stalwart bond the knight had built.\r\n\r\nReturning to the party site, Gonathon witnessed the voracious HPO demanding that Tam Gandr be the godparent of her expected spawnling (see [Gonathon-Irys: Even God's Can Bleed](#edge:irys-gigi)). Tam flatly refused, and the queen and Gonathon retreated to Mordan Ramsey's home to seek counsel and plan their next move (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Immortal Game](#edge:kronii-gigi)). After getting some words of wisdom from Mordan, including to simply slay HPO, the queen and her retainer returned to the raucous celebration.\r\n\r\nThere, the diabolical deity once again slung insults at Tam, including dredging up memories of the queen's time as HPO's maid. Unable to stand by any longer, Gonathon challenged HPO to a duel. If HPO won, Tam would be forced to be her child's godparent, but if Gonathon won, the degenerate nephilim would cease her torment of the queen. In a stunning display, Gonathon quickly cut down HPO, and following some much-deserved praise from Tam, departed to speak with Immerkind.\r\n\r\nIn a heartfelt, bittersweet scene, Immerkind laid out her plans to remain behind. Although Gonathon reiterated his desire not to leave behind his most treasured friend, he understood Immerkind's decision. The two shared a promise to meet each other again in the future, and after one last hearty awooo, went their separate ways.\r\n\r\nOnce again alone, the humble knight finally read through the notes left by Shiori. In them, Shiori thanked Gonathon for their time together and implored Gonathon to take to heart her words on making choices for himself, rather than blindly following others. She finished by reiterating that, despite all the tragedy that had happened between the two of them, Gonathon was still a good person deep down. Gonathon reflected on all of his experiences in the past Libestal, and concluded that it would be best if he, too, went on a [journey of reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=10505s).\r\n\r\nAlas, Gonathon's trials for the day were not yet over, for now he faced possibly his greatest struggle yet. At this moment, he received a call from Shiori in which the archiver revealed she had found the diaries of her past self that laid bare the traumatic experiences the two had endured in their brief relationship. It was here that Gonathon steeled himself and, rather than flee or make excuses as he had before, the humble knight charged straight in to confront Shiori. He explained to Shiori his side of the story and lamented the way he had treated her. Having seemingly righted the wrongs of the past, Gonathon thanked Shiori, and as the two parted for the day, Shiori gave a seemingly innocent farewell: \"See you tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nWith the primary adventures of the day behind him, Gonathon busied himself with tying up loose ends. He visited Bae, who was hard at work on decorating her house for her children, as well as Tam Gandr, who was now hatching a new plan to get back at HPO. Seeing his friends full of vigor and determination, Gonathon reflected on his own trials but vowed to continue moving forward. After writing his daily journal, the humble knight turned in for the night. All that remained was one final day, and with the Curse destroyed, it would hopefully promise to be one of celebration and relaxation.\r\n\r\n[The sun will always rise, the moon will always become full.

But apparently, that doesn’t mean it can’t happen again. This time, though, IRyS was _certain_. She believed, truly and deeply, that what she carried was no longer just air—but life. A living soul between her and her eternal consort.\n\nHer ever-supportive brother, of course, had already begun preparing. As any good sibling would.\n\n[Gender reveal party](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=498)\n\nA gender reveal party, open to the entire kingdom. Everyone was invited to share in the joy, even if half of them [didn’t really know](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=657) _what_ the occasion was. The venue was nothing short of grand—thanks to her brother and Roa. Seats for guests, a ceremonial birthing area (yes, on the spot), and above all, a great sign floating in the sky, ready to unveil the gender of the not-yet-born.\n\nIRyS was excited—not just for herself, but for her beloved, her eternal consort, who had no idea they were expecting. She couldn't wait to see their face.\n\n[Can't wait for the moment](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=1116)\n\nStill, even with this gas-baby situation looming, she had a world to save. Duty called. She joined the others in the final dungeon, taking on world-ending threats… but her mind stayed locked on [her stomach](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=2354).\n\nOnce that small feat—saving the world—was accomplished, it was time for the real event.\n\nIRyS had already picked out [names](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=3581). Gaston, if it were a boy. Gaslonia, if it were a girl. (Tasteful.) At the venue, guests gathered. Some excited. Some confused. Some deeply, deeply concerned. And most notably, her eternal consort stood among them—surely about to be shocked and overjoyed.\n\nExcept... someone else was there too.\n\nTammy.\n\nYou know, _the other_ one IRyS had been involved with. And Tammy, invited to a gender reveal for a child between IRyS and _someone else_, was _not_ having it. Her disgust was visible. Her rage, palpable. She even asked IRyS’ brother to [knock some sense](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5189) into her. Fair.\n\nBut the show must go on.\n\nEveryone turned to the sign in the sky. It slowly revealed its message. One letter at a time.\n\n[It's a boy, it's a girl, no, it's ~~gay~~](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5636)\n\nIt was a... gas.\n\nNot a girl. Not a boy. Not an attack helicopter.\n\n_A gas_. Well, a _girl gas_, to be specific.\n\nIRyS was elated. Too elated. She went into labor right then and there.\n\n[Live birthing is crazy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5739)\n\nWater broke. On to guests. Ew. Encouragements flew around the room: “Push! Push!” And then—pop. It was over. Except… she never saw the baby. Never held it. News came fast: Mococo had already _killed_ it. Somehow.\n\nIRyS didn’t even question it. She just felt relief, like passing the biggest gas she'd ever had.\n\nAnd then things spiraled.\n\nApparently, the child was actually [Tam and Ina’s](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=6901). Apparently, Tam and Ina had feelings for each other. Apparently, IRyS only saw Tam as a sister figure—despite their history. And Ina? Was she cheating on IRyS? No one knew what was real anymore (see [Kronii-IRyS: The Audacity](#edge:irys-kronii) and [Ina-IRyS: Turning To Another](#edge:ina-irys)).\n\nShe wrote it all down in her [journal](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=11636)—perhaps one of the last. Her account of childbirth. Of fading bonds. And a promise: if her eternal consort was truly turning away, truly seeking Tammy...\n\nIRyS would bring her back.\n\nNo matter what it took.",

Ina had no idea what the occasion was about, but knowing her consort, it could be anything. She was used to the shenanigans by now.\n\nStill, there was time before the event, so she joined the rest of the heroes to face the [final dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y_f17MHHHzc?si=bGojR6ml6N4nD56H&t=3175), the ultimate battle against the Heart of Ruin, to save the world.

Ina wanted to return that love, to show it clearly. So, she wrote a heartfelt letter, a confession of her desire to take the pink one as her wife.\n\n[Dear consort](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Y_f17MHHHzc?t=4487)\n\nThey exchanged their letters just before the party began.

Still, surely everything would stay the same, and nothing could ruin this, right?\n\nWell... it all came tumbling down from there (see [IRyS-Ina: Turning To Another](#edge:ina-irys)). And surely it wouldn’t lead to a side story where Ina would end up holding another’s hand and betraying the pink one, right?

            "content": "The Queen marches in her own time. \n\nWho said she was late? No, [the Queen is never late](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=137). The world is about to end? It was a simple matter for the benevolent Queen to delay the apocalypse by twenty minutes, for she was also the Warden of Time. \n\nThe fight for the future of Libestal began when all the heroes converged, Queen Tam being the last to arrive. Upon entering the final dungeon—the Heart of Ruin—Queen Tam was greeted with a grim curse: [the Curse of Betrayal](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=452). Apparently, some of the heroes had been corrupted, turning against the forces of good, and now had to be purified.\n\nThese cursed individuals were Shiori, Nerissa, Bijou, the Fuzzy One, and the Fluffy One, all of whom began to haunt their former comrades. Queen Tam was [haunted by her stepdaughter, Bijou,](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=646) while desperately fighting against the Stains, the voice of her stepdaughter urging her to attack everyone and give in to her darkest desires.\n\nNext came Shiori, far more skilled at exposing Queen Tam’s flaws. The abusive relationships, the vanity, the pet-play allegations—[everything was laid bare](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=750) by the corrupted Archivist, as Queen Tam vehemently denied each imperfection.\n\n[\"These are just allegations!\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=750)\n\nAfter successfully purifying their companions—and surviving all the humiliation in Queen Tam's case—Her Highness and the heroes emerged victorious and proceeded to the final stage. The battle against The Curse began with Queen Tam and the heroes [immediately jumping the enemy](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=990), not even letting it finish its monologue.\n\nThe fight was long and brutal. The Curse was unrelenting and vicious with its attacks, and could heal whenever one of the heroes fell, their Revelations could barely keep up. The Queen watched as her own knight Gonathon, tanked a heavy hit and was [brought down to his knees](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=1244).\n\nBut there was nothing to fear. Queen Tam and the others [vanquished The Curse](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=1269) for good. It was a battle worthy of legends, destined to be passed down for generations.\n\nAfter receiving gratitude from the Outlander and Princess Iphania, the benevolent Queen began checking in on her subjects, starting with Immerkind, who was smitten with the Princess and likely distraught over her apparent relationship with the Outlander. The Queen also mingled with the common folk and [discovered a budding romance among them](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=1787).\n\nNow, if this were where Queen Tam's day ended, it would have been perfect. But in true Queen Tam Gandr fashion, trouble was drawn to her like a moth to flame.\n\n[\"Immerkind in distress\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=2291)\n\nOne might say there should be a way to forcefully tell the Queen to put down the proverbial shovel and stop digging, but the voices in her head were ignored like passing wind. Immerkind, clearly in distress, failed to perform a proper curtsy. The Queen, taking immediate offense, would later feel awful—classic Queen Tam—upon learning of her emotional state.\n\nAfter offering comforting words to the green knight about her situation with Peasant the Bae, Queen Tam invited her to attend HPO's cursed “gender reveal” party. Why the Queen wanted to attend at all, no one truly knows.\n\nShe was greeted with the same bombastic sign—\"ITS GAS\"—that she had made the day before, now covered for dramatic effect. Naturally, the Queen wasted no time in digging another proverbial hole, unearthing drama like a seasoned groundhog. For reasons unfathomable, Queen Tam implied she was open to a [three-way relationship](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=2732) with HPO and her Consort Eternal, Nino Ina (see [Kronii-IRyS: The Audacity](#edge:irys-kronii)).\n\nQueen Tam next found herself attending Shakira and Roa Pandora’s wedding in the Great Hall. The voices in her head noted, yet again, that she never learned. First HPO’s “gender reveal” party, and now the wedding of her previous-timeline lover. Still, she stood in silence, watching one of her “happinesses” marry another. \n\n[\"Say cheese,\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5155) she said as she had herself participate in the group photo.\n\nNaturally, the ceremony wasn’t spared from drama. Queen Tam began implying that the “gas baby” was actually hers, which spiraled when Nino Ina claimed the child was born [from all three of them](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5204). One could barely keep composure while chronicling these strange Libestan happenings.\n\nThis hatched a plan in Queen Tam's mind. Why not just take Nino Ina for herself? She hired Mordon Ramsay to be her [wingman](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5950) and set the plan in motion. Queen Tam and Mordon visited Nino Ina, and she [immediately began gaslighting](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=6034) her to think that she does not deserve to be saddled with HPO and her baggage. Finally, the Queen was in her element and seemed to have successfully planted the seeds of doubt.\n\n[\"All according to keikaku.\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=6588)\n\nNot satisfied with her accomplishment, [Queen Tam deemed it necessary to stalk](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=6916) Nino Ina's house and saw HPO lurking around. They pretended not to see each other, quite literally, much to Bijou's distress, who was caught in the crossfire between two unrelenting petty forces insulting each other through her. \n\n[\"Why did I decide to love someone like you?\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=7701)\n\nBefore retiring for the day, Queen Tam visited Mordon Ramsay, who was busy preparing the house that she would auction the next day (to which the Queen was humble enough to proclaim she could not afford anyway). It was there that she confided to Mordon and Gonathon more of what she had talked about with HPO. Perhaps in a moment of true sincerity, [Mordon Ramsay gave her the ring](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=8737) she bought and was not able to use, for she was not able to find love in this timeline, hoping that Queen Tam would be able to find some use for it instead.\n\nAfter writing in her journal and having a quick but [heartfelt reflection with Gonathon](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=9187) on what transpired that day, Queen Tam finally retired for the day.",

Hand in hand, they looked ahead to a future together... until things started getting weird. Fast.\n\nTam—Tammy—whatever you wanted to call her, couldn’t stand the sight of the Pink One cuddling and fawning over someone else right in front of her. The same Pink One who had once promised love who now had the *audacity* to ask her to be godfather to a child that wasn't even theirs. It was an insult layered on betrayal.\n\n[She does not love you](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5979)\n\nSo Tam did what Tam had to do—she told Ina the truth.

It was a desperate attempt to sever the bond between the pink and the purple—and it worked.\n\nThings escalated fast.

She could’ve ended it there—but no, for some *unfathomable* reason, she added a wager: if she lost, she would have her abdomen cut open to check if the so-called child—this gas baby—was actually inside her.\n\nWhy?\n\n[Warning: Gore](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=6563)\n\nShe lost.

Suddenly, Nerissa is getting out without warning, leaving Elizabeth scrambling to do the same and get dressed.\n\nThat voice echoed in the back of her skull for a moment.\n\n---\n\n***Loyalty to an Evil King.***\n\nEvery angle feels like it's suffocating Elizabeth with these questions. Would she once again dedicate herself to the corrupt King? She is...a knight. Who pledges her loyalty to the King. But if he's corrupt, is it the right thing to do? Do you betray your King or follow in his shadow of darkness?\n\nThe harsh recall of memory. Nerissa asked her why she would stand by the King after he betrayed them. As he hurt them all. As she heard Mococo's pained cry her sister fell for just a moment.\n\nA question left unanswered in the end. Elizabeth doesn't know the right path for a knight. For her. Despite having experienced that path once.\n\n---\n\n\n***\"You were in my home.\"***\n\n[The sudden tone is dark.](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=11611) Nerissa sounds angry. Hurt. Elizabeth stumbles over her words a bit. \"It was to protect you! I-I wouldn't break and enter unless I had reason!\"\n\nAfter all, Elizabeth had been the one tricked!\n\n4 replaced discs. 200 gold to help fix a broken door—a rose without reason.\n\nSuddenly, a soft laugh breaks the heavy tension. Nerissa isn't angry, just teasing. Relief settles over Elizabeth's shoulders at that.\n\nAfter all, it was done to ensure Nerissa's safety. A proper knight would knock and await an answer. Not bash down a door in a brazen move without just cause.\n\n*I dare not trust your words, but you are a danger - so locked up you must.*\n\n---\n\n***\"The monster behind me now stands before you.\"***\n\nThe recent development in their relationship would have probably made one maiden’s heart swoon. Elizabeth had started warming up to her— following her around, giving her gifts, showering her with praises, and  making sure she was well and protected. \n\nShe even called her beautiful. And promised she would always stay by her side…\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nIf only the scarlet knight had realized a bit earlier… she would’ve folded and lowered her defenses. However, thorns have already grown on the flesh of this delicate rose. Every warm and gentle touch would sting deeper, making it ever more painful to bear.\n\nThe cards had been flipped. Elizabeth was oblivious to the menacing side of the person she was falling for. As if entranced by the siren’s sweet song, she moved according to the witch’s will.\n\nDefenseless. Vulnerable. On the palm of the monster she created.",

She was truly a “monster,” befitting of the song titled Monster being played in the background. Forcing Queen Tam to celebrate her conception with another lover wasn’t enough—she also had to make her the godmother.\n\n[\"You sicken me...\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3072)\n\nAccompanied by her trusty knight, Gonathon, Queen Tam ran away from the scene in anger and disgust. [\"Back off, you monster!\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3146) Queen Tam said, poison in her speech. Seeking shelter in her own home, Queen Tam and Gonathon were visited by the licensed therapist (among many things), [Mordon Ramsay](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3175). It was finaly time for her long-overdue therapy. \n\nAfter a few interruptions, Queen Tam was finally able to [trauma dump](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3600), explaining all her woes, most of which seemed to trace back to a single source: the Hot Pink One. Fortunately, they had the best therapist in town.\n\n[\"Have you considered murder?\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3721)\n\nSuch was the \"based\" take by the renowned therapist/chef/real estate magnate. Murder was a question, and the answer was always \"yes.\" Just eliminate the root of her problems—HPO. The voices in Queen Tam’s head all agreed, even as she questioned the legitimacy of Dr. Mordon’s license.\n\nIt was then that Mordon revealed that HPO had three \"wives,\" insinuating that there was also something in between her and Bijou, her own brother. Of course, it was not a Libestal delicacy without a sprinkling of an additional forbidden ingredient that rhymes with [\"in chest\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3844).\n\nSpeaking of the devil, HPO called Queen Tam and begged her to attend the \"gender reveal\" party, to which pretty much everyone involved already knew what it was. [\"You made yourself into a spectacle!\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3892) Queen Tam exclaimed. And so the cursed celebration began. Bijou and Peasant the Bae unveiled the sign Queen Tam had made, revealing the “gender” of the “baby.”\n\n[\"It's ~~gay~~ Gas!\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3959)\n\nAll this… for a long, painful divine comedy about passing gas. Hot Pink Gas. The Queen didn’t even need to be there. And yet she and the voices in her head were forced to witness the “birth” of the “gassy baby”—Just [\"Carbonated Love\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4071). Unsightly.\n\nDr. Mordon returned with more [sagely advice](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4128): Why not confront HPO’s consort and spill the beans about their secret relationship? Scorched earth. Why should Queen Tam be the only one to suffer? Might as well make everyone involved miserable. This therapist was truly something else. Everyone knows the drill. Instead of walking away and moving on, the Queen held the proverbial shovel firmly in her hands and dug deeper, choosing to confront the consort herself, Nino Ina.\n\n[\"I want problems. Always.\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4247)\n\nThings took a turn when the Hot Pink One casually [dismissed Queen Tam as just a “hobby.”](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4381) It escalated into a duel, Queen Tam’s honor on the line. Her brave knight, Gonathon, ever loyal, stepped forward—ready to challenge the Hot Pink One, a literal goddess. The conditions were set, a gruesome one involving cutting open the HPO's stomach upon her defeat. \n\n[\"Gonathon the Godslayer.\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4835)\n\nAnd of course, Gonathon wiped the floor with the puny goddess, reclaiming his Queen’s honor—and perhaps his \"aura.\" \n\n\"You must fight in mortal terms!\" the brave knight yelled as he dealt the decisive blow.\n\nWhat followed was a [scenario so bizarre](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4854) that one would struggle to put pen to paper to describe what exactly happened - gutting HPO like a fish, alcohol somehow being the real “baby,” and a C-section pun for good measure. But unlike Queen Tam, we move on.\n\n[\"In the midst of 'so over,' we found, within Libestal, a romantic 'we're so back.'\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5044)\n\n\nOn the other end, Pinky was handling Tam’s judgment the only way she knew how—like a sulking child. She ignored her, pretended not to hear a word, avoided eye contact, and pouted in exaggerated silence. To Tam, it was nothing short of infuriatingly immature.\n\n[A fly is buzzing](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=8813)\n\nIt was getting really weird.\n\nWhat *was* clear, though, was this: the bonds IRyS had cherished were crumbling. Tam had lost all respect for her. Her eternal consort’s affections seemed to waver—possibly drifting toward the blue lady. Even her brother had grown [distant](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=10224).\n\nSomething snapped.\n\nIRyS began to spiral. Love-blind, fogged with desperation. She would not lose them.

As Gonathan began reading, casually quipping about Mordan’s little “oopsies,” fate, ever fond of irony, brought Mordan herself to [appear in proximity,](https://www.youtube.com/live/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=1554) wandering near the tree unaware she was even being spoken of. She approached the chest she had left for Gonathan, confirming the book had indeed been received.\n\n[All is well in the kingdom](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=5211)\n\n“All is well in the kingdom. That’s all I need to know. All I needed to know. I am happy for my friend. You should be happy for your friends. In this life, where we only get so many chances to be with our friends, perhaps the best idea is to put aside selfish desires. Selfish desires? I’m being silly; I don’t feel those things. I don’t feel emotions. Only lust for money, fo-sho. Okay, maybe not lust for money, but definitely love for my pack.”\n\nIn a previous conversation between Mordan, Shiori, and Bijou, Mordan had not realized her purchase history was visible in the market chest. Her secret deed thus exposed, she eventually confessed to buying the book in error. And yet, one wonders, was it truly an accident? Or had Mordan, perhaps subconsciously, attempted to delay Gonathon’s receipt of it? As she reflected on all that had transpired since that moment, her lingering affections for her wolf brother Gonathon, not least among them, Mordan seemed to accept her lonely role in this tragic kingdom.\n\nAround the time of the new dungeon’s opening, during a kerfuffle among the heroes of Libestal, a small gesture towards Gonathan somehow led Mordan to even deeper despair. [Offering food to Gonathan](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=7889s) in preparation for the upcoming battle, she was met with silence, leading her to believe that Gonathan was giving her the cold shoulder:\n\n“Gonathan doesn’t want anything to do with me. That’s fine, whatever. I don’t care; I don’t have emotions. I don’t have emotions… Yeah, what a shame, ignored by my own wolf brother. That’s messed up.”\n\nA simple misunderstanding or miscommunication, perhaps, but for a heart already cracked by unrequited love and perceived rejection, the sting was undeniable.\n\n[Rescheduled auctions turn into unscheduled therapy sessions](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=13010s)\n\nMuch later in the day, both Mordan and Gonathan found themselves together once more, standing before the auction block as Tam Gandr recounted her latest romantic woes. Listening intently, Mordan and Gonathan offered what counsel they could. In a quiet gesture that betrayed her own wounded heart, Mordan offered Tam a “Gorgeous Ring,” the very same she had intended to give Gonathan only days prior.\n\nSensing the heaviness in Mordan’s voice, Gonathan gently sought to lift her spirits. Gonathan, along with Tam, reminded her of all she had built in this Libestal: her chef activities, her tavern, her therapy business, and now her business as a realtor. Gonathan considered Mordan the “most qualified person in this kingdom,” even proposing she learn medicine so that she might help during emergencies, referencing the recent chaos surrounding the Hot Pink One. With so few hands available in the kingdom, Mordan acknowledges being able to fit many kinds of roles for different circumstances.\n\nAnd yet, despite her many accomplishments, there was no denying that a sadness lingered in her heart. Mordan had been unsuccessful in love, unsuccessful in previously courting Gonathan, and uncertain in her role in the kingdom, and in turn left, hoping that others might find what she could not.\n\n[“But like all things, a broken heart can be mended,”](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=16989) she said softly as advice to Tam. Perhaps, just perhaps, the advice she gave was not only meant for Tam but also for herself.",

Arriving at Shiori's house, Gonathon once again faced one whom she had previously loved, but now saw as a stranger. This time, Gonathon responded almost casually, a resigned sense of acceptance filling her voice as she conversed with Shiori. Expecting to find a book waiting for her, the amnesiac archiver responded in confusion, pointing the knight to Mordan Ramsey, who had bought the book by mistake. \n\nArriving home, Gonathon found a chest waiting for her with the book inside. The book directed her to a hidden site behind her tree, where a number of items related to Shiori's now removed memories could be found. While Gonathon collected these items, she did not have time to go over them. For Shiori of the Nyavellas was now requesting Gonathon's aid in the new farm area, and, determined to not let a chance to converse with her slip her by, eagerly agreed.\n\nArriving at the farming area, Gonathon once again met up with Shiori. Gonathon demonstrated her knightly prowess to Shiori by protecting her and mining items for her. Then, under the watchful eye of [the moon](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4171), the two sat together and began to converse. Shiori revealed that she did indeed remember a form of Gonathon, her \"true\" self who the archiver simply referred to as \"G.\" Questioning why Gonathon was not with her usual friends and gang, the knight responded that she was still unsure of who she was, and what she wanted for her story. \n\nWith the sun's playful rays beginning to peek out from the horizon, the conversation turned to memories. [Shiori remarked](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4297) that she preferred to seal painful memories away, rather than bear their burden. Gonathon retorted by stating that, regardless of whether Shiori remembered her or not, she knew the archiver was truly kind. Realizing the burden that Shiori bore as an archiver, Gonathon stated that no one could have the answer to everything, as this was a burden too great to shoulder alone. The conversation ended on a peaceful note, with Gonathon promising to fight by Shiori and the archiver wishing to meet the knight again.\n\nFollowing the epic clash with the Heart of Ruin, in which Gonathon assisted in purifying a curse placed on the archiver, and a jovial meal at HPO's party, Gonathon finally turned to the letters Shiori had left for her. The last words the witch had left for her thanked Gonathon for all the time they had spent together and implored the humble knight to live not just for the sake of others, but also for herself. Moved by Shiori's words, Gonathon thought back to her time with Bae (see [Bae-Gonathon: A Bromance of Eternity Borne Under the Light of the New Moon](#edge:bae-gigi)) and decided that she, too, would set out on a journey of self-discovery. And with this, it seemed that the blank slate between archiver and knight was set to have a new set of memories etched upon it, free of the dark reminders of the past.\n\nAlas, this was not to be as Shiori uncovered the diaries from the previous days, their contents revealing the blackest depths of her encounters with Gonathon. Requesting that Gonathon speak with her, it appeared that history was set to repeat itself in the most tragic way imaginable. But it was here that the noble knight truly took her first steps towards a brighter future. Meeting face to face with the Archiver once more, Gonathon owned up to the sins she had committed and apologized for the way she had used Shiori as a means of escaping the pain of her lost love. Most important of all for the humble knight was the kindness that Shiori gave her, both before and after losing her memories. Gonathon made one final request: that the two continue to speak like this. Departing on a melancholy but fulfilling note, the two promised to meet each other at the banquet tomorrow. And thus, the tale of the fumbling knight had ended. Where the story of Shiori of the Nyavellas goes next is unclear, but one thing is certain. Their story together is far from over.",

Just as Gonathon found himself caught in Shiori of the Nyavella's web of intrigue, so too did Tam find herself constantly pulled back to the false embrace of the Hot Pink One.

It would not be much later that the two would reunite, and it would once again be in unsettling circumstances. For the heroes had, for whatever reason, put together a party celebrating the supposed birth of HPO's child, and the shameless goddess, high off the adoration of her companions, demanded that Tam submit herself once again into her service as [the child's godparent](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=7523).\n\n[Gonathon defies divinity for his queen](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=7568s)\n\nFinally, at her breaking point, Tam in no uncertain terms refused HPO's advances. Meeting with Mordan Ramsey and Gonathon, Mordan and Gonathon provided advice to the distraught queen, while also revealing the reprehensible depths of HPO's depravity in the number of wives she had taken. At the party, the narcissistic nephilim began taunting the queen, proclaiming she was simply a maid. Enraged by the treatment of the queen at HPO's hands (see [Irys-Gonathon: Even Gods Can Bleed](#edge:irys-gigi)), Gonathon once again [leapt into action](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=8983). In a stunning display of knightly skill and courage, the humblest of knights slew HPO in single combat, all for the sake of his queen's freedom. Having once again defended Tam's honor, the queen thanked Gonathon for his service.\n\n[A goddess slain, a queen redeemed.](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9277)\n\nLater, Gonathon met up with Tam at Mordan Ramsey's auction. Lamenting how poor she was, Tam's bitterness began to bubble to the surface. She [spilled her guts](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=12978) to Mordan and Gonathon concerning HPO's true feelings: the immoral imp had dismissed her and the queen's love as simply one of many flings, a mere footnote in the goddess's escapades. Wronged for the last time, Tam confided in Gonathon and Mordan her plan: she would steal HPO's consort eternal, NinoIna, and drag HPO down to the depths of despair, just as the queen had been. Gonathon, ever loyal, promised to meet Tam early to assist in these plans. Before parting for the day, Gonathon reminded Tam that many respected her and that, once again, she should take pride in her status as Queen of Libestal.\n\n[The most resolute of knights](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=13750)",

But if one's faith is returned only with scorn and worse, humiliation, it can turn even the most devout sycophant into a hardened heretic. Over the course of the adventure in past Libestal, Gonathon had remained devoted to the Hot Pink One, believing her to be a goddess worthy of veneration. But even zealots can be pushed too far, and the HPO would soon learn this the hard way.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Heart of Ruin, much of the day was committed to the celebration of HPO's supposed child. However, it was not enough to have undeserved love and adoration heaped on her by all in attendance; the gluttonous goddess desired something more: for Tam Gandr to commit herself to being her child's godparent.\n\n[Mordan gives some good advice on dealing with HPO](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=8206s)\n\nTam [adamantly refused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=7533s), but HPO persisted, dredging up horrific memories of the humiliation she had inflicted upon Tam as a means of humbling the battered queen. All of this was [too much](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=7566) for Gonathon G to bear; goddess or no, HPO could not treat his queen this way. Standing between HPO and Tam, Gonathon presented an ultimatum: HPO would engage him in single combat, with the queen's honor on the line.\n\n[I answer to my queen!](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=8982)\n\nAssembling at the arena, HPO quickly experienced cold feet. Tam was quick to goad the spineless nephilim into honoring her end of the deal, for surely a goddess could defeat a mere knight? Donning the arms of a humble warrior the goddess and retainer met on the fields of battle as equals. But for all the goddess's haughty words and self-proclaimed superiority, she was no match for [the skills and determination](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9277) of Tam's most loyal knight and fell within seconds. As HPO writhed in agony as her divine flesh was rended by Bijou, Tam thanked Gonathon for once again always being by her side (see [Gonathon-Kronii](#edge:kronii-gigi)).\n\n[A stain upon us all](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9317)",

Now, it was time to wind down, enjoy the company of those she cherished, and prepare for the grand banquet that marked the end of it all. Oh—and build a roof for her café. It wouldn't do to let customers get soaked in the rain, after all.\n\nBut before any of that, there was one last thing to do: gather everyone for a group picture. One final commemorative snapshot of this mysterious, chaotic, unforgettable adventure.\n\n[A photo to remember](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9A1cO7jL0jw?t=1681)\n\nAfterward, Fuwawa returned to her beloved café, rolling up her sleeves for the final touch. She decided on a natural design: a canopy of green leaves and soft sakura petals draping elegantly over the bright quartz exterior. It gave the place a vibrant, inviting charm—cheerful and fluffy, just like its owner.\n\n[Cafe complete!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9A1cO7jL0jw?t=2950)\n\nAnd just like that, it was done. Everything—*everything*—was complete. From having nothing to becoming the wealthiest; from being unknown to bringing smiles to countless faces with her cooking. Fuwawa had come so far, and she was endlessly grateful for everyone who had supported her along the way.\n\nStill, something tugged at her heart. A subtle feeling, hard to explain, but it centered on four others—Nerissa, Mococo, Bijou, and Shiori. There was something special about this group. A deep resonance. Enough for her to imagine them not as passing allies, but as something more—something lasting. A group, a bond, a chosen family that would weather all storms together.\n\n[Rebellion](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9A1cO7jL0jw?t=3304)\n\nShe penned her [final diary entry](https://www.youtube.com/live/9A1cO7jL0jw?t=3729), wrapping up her journey in Libestal with warm memories and hopeful thoughts. That lingering feeling, though—about those four—would soon prove to be more than just a whim.\n\n(See [Princess–Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander))",

            "content": "**Knight's Log 006**\r\n\r\nA knight of honor. Smith of the Jade Forge. Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame.\r\n\r\n[Spilled ink, soaked in sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=-HpFkakfPqE6y6EO&t=363). Written words of emotions across pages filled with lies. Fragile memories sold for coin. Works of a true witch.\r\n\r\nIf the ink speaks the truth, then [let me forget](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=9ftHdvHFDe7BKzLe&t=410). Let me live in a world where the truth is the lie and the lie is the truth.\r\n\r\nWhat is fear? Not for oneself, but for someone else. What quells the flame of concern?\r\n\r\nNerissa's possession of her body had instilled in me a fear that I was too late. Was purifying her enough? Had the time I spent calling her a witch caused so much damage that she turned?\r\n\r\nShe is the light of my flame. The flickers of emotions, the lick of heat against my skin. She is the rose above the thorns that cut.\r\n\r\n_\"What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other word would smell as sweet.\"_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs day breaks, Elizabeth seeks out Nerissa without hesitation. When the knock on the door goes unanswered, she moves to check the windows, disappointed not to see her present. A quick call remedies the situation.\r\n\r\nThey joke about the music, the looping track that still drives Elizabeth crazy. An invitation inside with a quick pass to hold the ring given to her days ago. Proof that she's not a witch—it's nothing more than a magic trick with looping discs.\r\n\r\nIn the back of her mind sits the warning from Kiara about apologies and corrections, yet her tongue sits too heavy to speak the words still.\r\n\r\nBack upstairs in Nerissa's home, she notes the roses and ring frame on the wall—gifts she had given. Taking the ring off the wall, Nerissa wears hers to match the one Elizabeth is wearing.\r\n\r\n_Promise rings. Nothing more._\r\n\r\nThen Nerissa requests a spar, something they've been doing daily now. And yet, Elizabeth makes an even stranger request: to go gambling (see: [Nerissa-Elizabeth: Finding Shelter in the Shadows of Hope](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\r\n\r\n[\"Maybe you are my lucky blue.\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=SGFe8V8u909-nM1L&t=2025)\r\n\r\nWith gambling completed, the two move to spar. Jokes are made during combat. And then Elizabeth says something out of the blue.\r\n\r\n[\"I am your knight!\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=iZB5pI1FOkv_Iq_t&t=2213)\r\n\r\nEven when Nerissa questions it, Elizabeth doesn't take the statement back. She doubles down with a \"yes,\" solidifying her new stance on the woman in blue and her lucky charm.\r\n\r\nWith a prize from Nerissa, they jest about rings on each finger. Of Elizabeth being a queen. A princess.\r\n\r\n[\"You can be the princess, and I can be the knight.\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=nwUrn5ouuy9Hr7Se&t=2738)\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth discovers Nerissa is in a witches' coven with Shiori and Bijou. It leaves a foul taste in the mouth of the knight. It's in this moment that she declares Nerissa is not a witch.\r\n\r\nThe two quickly stop by Queen Tam Gandr’s, where Nerissa commits breaking and entering right in front of Elizabeth. The knight chides the princess, jesting, \"Maybe you should be a vampire, so you'll follow the rules!\"\r\n\r\nStanding over burned memories and an ash-coated lie about her absence during this apparent party, the two step away to talk.\r\n\r\n[\"Will you be loyal to me?\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=MwXStMNDmCrPZwVj&t=3119)\r\n\r\nA question filled with weight. Is it in jest? Or is she serious?\r\n\r\nElizabeth answers yes. With a promise, through thick and thin. Nerissa claims her as _her_ knight, of a smaller flame, without Nerissa.\r\n\r\n[\"Are you happy here?\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=Haluy3WzBkSIgdNi&t=3405)\r\n\r\nIt's a loaded question, even for herself. How happy is one existing in the past when there are memories of the future? Would one be so willing to forget to avoid what may be a painful truth? Afraid of those ink-soaked words having a scratch of truth to them?\r\n\r\nAfter a quick but heartfelt apology, the two move to watching the auction and the chaos over copyright and templates. It’s small talk, but there seems to be less tension between them.\r\n\r\nBack at home, a [heart-to-heart with Kiara](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=oGPHYYz-3nlKro3Y&t=4582) reveals their shared nature as knights—both in thought and action. A reminder that Kiara is moving out is painful for Elizabeth, but she’s happy for her friend.\r\n\r\nBut Kiara doesn’t let things slide. She asks about Nerissa, about the blue that feels like it lights the flame of her chest. What is she to Elizabeth? A few [joke names](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=E3oALHLYZAo5suDE&t=4950) are tossed around: Princess of Blue, of Gambling, of Sound, of…Potato Salad?\r\n\r\n\"Princess of her heart,\" Kiara says.\r\n\r\nThe words catch Elizabeth off guard, but she doesn’t deny them. Red in the face, she tries to accept that Nerissa is just another person close to her heart.\r\n\r\nWith the chat with Kiara concluded, Elizabeth moves to find Nerissa once again, replicating something unique to them.\r\n\r\n[“Juliet, Juliet!”](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=wW_PnKZylMBJiFeK&t=5150)\r\n\r\nThough neither remembers the lines fully, it is a cheerful memory for them. Romeo and Juliet. Elizabeth and Nerissa.\r\n\r\nWith the banquet in mind, Elizabeth realizes she needs fireworks! Nerissa offers her paper and money to buy the gunpowder to make them. Quickly running to the castle store, she buys gunpowder and paper before returning to Nerissa again. Never too far from her side.\r\n\r\nWhen Nerissa gives her the paper, she starts to leave before running back to kiss her on the cheek and swiftly leaving. No words are said or given about the kiss, but it doesn’t seem to bother the knight.\r\n\r\nEven still, with the banquet closing in, Elizabeth wishes to stay and not return to the future.\r\n\r\nAnd moments before, Elizabeth asks Nerissa again, [“Are you okay?”](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=aVt1IOPOs86fL63N&t=6456)\r\n\r\nTo make it in time, Elizabeth uses magic and teleports for her princess to make it in time. And the banquet begins (see: [Princess-Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander)).\r\n\r\nElizabeth is shocked by Nerissa's change. She has sworn herself as a knight to the other. Will she bend the knee and break her word as a knight? Or will she give in once more to what seems to be corruption, as she had done for the king?",

Since there was no court to truly prosecute a crime, it was but a silly moment for everyone.\n\nNow, time to remember this chapter with pictures! \n\n[Group Photo in the Library](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1190)\n\nShortly after the photo, Bae's two Promise members were still fighting. Bae watched as they walked while trading barbs and insults. To her shock, Bae learned that the Hero had [***dumped*** the goddess.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1370)\n\nNot having one last group photo with her fellow suppliers would be amiss. Though Bae and Cecilia were still rather awkward after the rejection, they were still cordial. It was during their talk that Bae found out [there were only three suppliers](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1413) in the whole kingdom.\n\n[Bae's Vow](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1497)\n\n[Suppliers' Splendid Snapshots](#embed:https://youtu.be/IWNcqsQxuWo?t=5380)\n\nThey ventured back to where they first mined. It was a perfect spot to capture their last meeting before going their separate ways. Gonathan agreed; he might be a humble knight, but Bae's brother was a truly talented photographer. Capturing multiple angles, suggesting poses, and encapsulating the candid moments truly exemplified his experience with the camera. \n\nBae returned the favor, taking photos of Gonathan and his fellow pack in front of Mordan's Tavern... shortly after [Mordan's prank faded,](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1921) their [photo was taken.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2097)\n\nAs Bae left, one of the houses in the auction caught her eye. An interesting one, a 7LDK (seven bedrooms, a living room, dining room, and kitchen), was up for sale, though... [its roof seemed to be quite avant-garde](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2234) Shiori and Bae competed to buy the house before the writer remembered that Bae has kids now (one of whom was hers and Bijou's) and gracefully bowed out. But not before Bijou upped the price to 2,000 gold.\n\n[A Home to Return](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2357)\n\nAs the co-parents talked, Bae told them of her plans to finally leave this accursed Libestal and run back to the woods, this time bringing Khaos and Chaoz with her. There, Bae will teach [them the way of the Peasants.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2484) Truly, Bae is the Peasant Parent (PP) that stepped up. \n\nAs she went home to gather her kids to bring them to the banquet with her, Mococo came by to visit. The demon dog curiously looked over Bae's supplies and home. Still a supplier at heart, Bae would trade a few of the colorful fireworks, the same ones she painstakingly suffered to create, with Mococo.\n\nNow, with the kids in tow, Bae left the home that brought her much.\n\n[Bothering IRyS for the Last Time (in Libestal)](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2838)\n\nAfter destroying IRyS's property, breaking her jukebox, and setting off fireworks inside her shop, Bae finally questioned IRyS on what happened between her and Kronii yesterday. [Bae immediately doubted IRyS's answer,](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2984) knowing Kronii was mostly reasonable at times and IRyS was IRyS. Still, today was their last day, and amends would be attempted for a group photo. Bae extended the olive branch to her Queen, which was reciprocated.\n\n[The Promised Photo](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=3302)\n\nAnd of course, a final diary entry. A final message... GOODBYE LIBESTAL. With that, Bae was done.\n\nHuzzah! The banquet is here! Fireworks were shared and fired within range of flammable materials in an enclosed environment. Joy was had, and the celebrations resounded throughout the halls.\n\nAll was right! [Well, except for some last-minute cannibalism.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=3634)\n\n\nA scream.\n\n(See [Princess–Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander))",

Through the suffering she endured, her perseverance paid off: Roa finally achieved the happiness she sought. There was little Roa could add to make her life better. But, as she watched Mordan build another house for the auction, [the chef suggested](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=596) a new house for the newlyweds.\n\nUnfortunately, Roa was too broke to afford a new house. With the Gacharms' charms now obsolete, Roa turned to the jobs available. As she pondered by the Quest Board, Gonathan came by to congratulate her on her marriage. They traded pleasantries; Gonathan teasing Roa about her \"special night\" with Kiara, and Roa, in turn, asked if Gonathan had a special person in his life, to which he replied 'no'. \n\nNow with a wife to support, Roa was back in the Remnant Fields, fulfilling her quota per quest taken. There, Roa met Bijou, who mentioned experiencing a strange dream last night. One where strange creatures stayed in her head. Roa mentioned that she, too, had a similar dream. Perhaps the [memory commission](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=1027) Roa received from Shiori would offer some clues. \n\nRoa headed to Mordan's Tavern to meet Kiara and learned that there was a suite for the two of them. To celebrate their marriage and each other. \n\nA scenic view, flower petals scattered around, music to set the mood, and some nice drinks. Specifically, invisibility potions. Kiara also received her... special fanfiction from Shiori earlier:\n\n[Mamma Mia, this is too spicy.](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=2460)\n\n[##############](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=2627)\n\nTrue love is rather impure at times, some would say. What transpired in the tavern could be left to your imagination, and a description of any sort wouldn't capture the insanity of this... moment.\n\nAfter the romantic pet play passed between the two, they soon began a discussion about purchasing a home at the auction for their family. They toured the houses, noting which ones they liked, favoring the larger first house in particular.\n\n[A New House for 9,000 Gold!](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=4306)\n\nWith their efforts combined, Kiara and Roa won the auction for their dream house! Though the price was driven up by Bijou and, in her excitement, even Kiara herself.\n\nAnd of course, a day in Libestal would not be complete without a controversy of some kind, as the hero Ina accused Mordan of copying the architectural design of Ina's home and thereby profiting from Ina's intellectual property.\n\nAnd finally, to commemorate their journey, the heroes started taking pictures. Roa took one with [the whole group](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=4843) and another with her [Gacharms Co.](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=5136)\n\n[The Pink Panthera.](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=5271)\n\nA small moment of respite, Roa started reading the memory she obtained from Shiori. It told her of strange, Gatorade-colored, furry beings begging for jetpacks from their mama and their rather peculiar love of cucumbers and pineapple on pizzas. \n\nSince there was still time before the banquet was due to start, Roa spent a little bit more time with her friends, bonding with the Hot Pink One, purchasing some cake from Fuwawa's cafe, and adding some [decorations](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=5725) to her new home.\n\n[The One Happy Couple of the Story.](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=5924)\n\nA little [gacha](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=6977)  didn't hurt either, since the money would be useless after today. She managed to win a few statues too, one of which was a familiar jade figurine.\n\n[A Gift to Elizabeth and Congratulations to Nerissa](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=7124)\n\nAnd now to the banquet. \n\n(See [Princess–Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander))",

Even so, she wondered what to do with the money she had earned. Perhaps she could buy another ring and marry someone special, but she had long decided that married life wasn't one for the therapist. \n\nInstead, she thought that she should expand her hand-built neighborhood into a little town called [Mordonville.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=840)\n\n----\nINSPIRED OR COPIED?\n\nWith no more time to spare, Mordan started the bidding war for the three houses she had built. That is, before [home inspections revealed holes in the walls](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=4991), which Mordan immediately patched up. \n\nThe first house was a small one-bedroom property. Nothing too special. The bid started at 500 coins, and it went to Gonathon, her fellow wolf, for 2672 coins. The second one was slightly bigger. It was a 2LDK with a mini front yard. That one went to the couple in the front. (See: [Kiara-Raora: And so, Sesbian Lex.](#edge:raora-kiara))\n\nThe last house was the biggest of them all. It was akin to a mansion with seven bedrooms and-------- \n\n[***STOP THE AUCTION!***](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=5528)\n\nA voice in the crowd commanded Mordan's attention. It was Bijou and her very own legal team. The jeweler accused Mordan of plagiarizing Ina's house; from the brick foundation to the stone rooftops, it was almost the same in look—which was definitely not true! Mordan called for the original patent of the purple one's house plan. \n\nThe patent that Ina soon showed seemed to be drawn on a napkin—something Mordan loudly mocked.\n\n*[“You look like a napkin!”](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=5648)*\n\nIn the end, Bae bought it for 2000 coins. \n\n----\n\n\nMordan knew that she would miss these moments with everyone, and she needed to cherish them the best she could. Thus, she took a picture with [the chefs](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?si=6XoSGMMzfTlRSZ0V&t=6193) and another with the rest of [the wolf pack!](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?si=uNJIZEhlu-vuZzXE&t=6784)\n\n[Last diary entry!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?si=uNJIZEhlu-vuZzXE&t=7627)\n\nAs fireworks lit up the twilight sky, the banquet had begun—but sadly, even laughter couldn't silence the fate that was fast approaching. \n\n(See [Princess–Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander))",

            "content": "A writer's work was never done; there were countless stories to be written even as Shiori's script will soon conclude. It is with this in mind that Shiori found herself writing once again, in the early morning of Libestal, finishing the commissions she had left. Luckily, only a few remained—Kiara's rather [_suggestive_ fanfiction](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=553), Roa's memory, and Bijou's commission.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the newlywed couple's _spicy_ story, Shiori left for the Library to obtain another blank journal for Roa's memory. There, Shiori met her own wife, Bijou. They talk about how the banquet will be magnificent; nothing about it shall be dyed red, but if there will be red, it will be the red of love and hearts! Only trays of joy shall be served—not be*tray*als. [Things will be fine.](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=764)\r\n\r\nThey parted ways to settle some unfinished business, and Shiori found a quiet place to write. She looked for a memory in the Void. One from Before Libestal.\r\n\r\nShiori saw blue, furry, cat-like beings begging for jetpacks in her mind's eye. How they were upset when denied, but quickly rejoiced over the mention of cucumbers. She saw the bemused frown on the Pink Panther's face as she admonished the #########s. An occurrence that happened quite often to her amusement.\r\n\r\nWith the memory book now filled and the story done, Shiori gave them to their respective owners, even earning a nice tip from Kiara. Kindness given deserves kindness in turn, so Shiori gifted Kiara some [home cooking](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=1548) to thank her.\r\n\r\nFrom the start of their journey to the end, the phoenix had been one of the kinder knights in Libestal to Shiori, especially, when compared to two particular Knights. Shiori genuinely enjoyed her company, and the two chatted a bit more. Shiori listened to Kiara fret over her wedding night as she gave out suggestions: some of the vegetables are rather potent and can be used as aphrodisiacs.\r\n\r\n[It's the Heart, Not the Hips.](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=1615)\r\n\r\nWith too much time to spare, Shiori completed some quests and cooked a bit more, flipping through the pages of the cookbook to save in her collection before they parted this world. A picnic would be pleasant as well. Shiori invited Mordan, but though the chef had initially agreed, she was too busy preparing for her auction. Shiori appreciated Mordan's hard work as she took a quick tour of one of the houses, noting the resemblance to Ina's house and that Kiara would probably be bidding for one of them. Shiori considered a prank, hiding a jukebox to annoy the homeowner with music, but decided against it. Shiori Nyavella was a kind witch.\r\n\r\nLeaving the chef to her business, Shiori invited Cecilia to the picnic. They talked about how they can't wait for the party later, how fireworks would suit the occasion, and jumping over the campfire. And, of course, gossip about the rather _complicated_ relationships in Libestal and the drama it had produced. But each person was truly the hero of their own story; it was their tale to tell while others were but a part of it, be they minor or background characters or the villains. In the end, they were part of a larger, grander epic.\r\n\r\nWith her main commissions out of the way and hunger satiated, there wasn't much for Shiori to do. She found herself cooking again, venturing to the Remnant Fields briefly to collect gold and milk for a recipe. As Shiori headed back, [she heard Ina's sorrows](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=4091) as the hero wrote a letter to a certain pink someone. Roa was also nearby, relaxing in the onsen, soon telling Shiori of the happy night the pink cat shared with Kiara.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of beloveds, Shiori met up with Bijou once again during Mordan's auction. She wondered if they would need a new house, but Bijou was already content with the GothRock they already had, her Jeweled One said as she looked at Shiori fondly. The two watched as the rest of their friends bought houses to start their wonderfully short lives in Libestal. Things were peaceful before a confrontation inevitably came to pass, as Mordan was accused of intellectual theft by Ina. A matter that was dropped and forgotten soon after, as they no longer had the time to fit in another dramatic scenario.\r\n\r\n[A Memory to Save...](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=5266)\r\n\r\nFor a moment, Shiori was filled with ire as she saw that the fields were [not replanted properly](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=5334) once again. It was probably the Fuzzy one, Shiori assumed, since the demon dog had been acting rather off in the past few days. Perhaps this world deserved to _burn_.\r\n\r\n[A Recipe for Recollection](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=5616)\r\n\r\nThe chefs took another commemorative photo together. Well, after almost everyone fought Mordan to let out some steam since the reaper kindly offered to be the Hot Pink's punching bag. As they talked about their final day, they congratulated Fuwawa on her successful business; from catering the disastrous party to selling quite a bit of her food, the Fluffy One probably being the one who earned the most money amongst them.\r\n\r\nLeft to her devices, but not for long, as Bijou would join her shortly after. [From a hole.](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6167) It was just a hole, albeit a rather deep one. Shiori conspired with Bijou to enact the prank she had thought of earlier, even grander, as they could build a tunnel of love that could connect from this strange hole and then add bonfires and ticking noises to further annoy others. But that must wait until the next chapter.\r\n\r\nBut as they planned the prank, Mordand and Bae came by, since Bae was planning to buy one of Mordan's houses. Shiori and Bijou attempted to outbid Bae for the house before soon withdrawing as they [remembered Bae has kids now](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6411), one of whom was their own, and they have visitation anyway. State Farm will be much closer now, though Bae would soon leave Libestal with her kids after the banquet, to the couple's surprise.\r\n\r\nAs a final mischief, Shiori and Bijou sneaked into Mordan's Tavern, criticizing the surprising lack of pillows and proper bedding in the establishment. It doesn't seem very comfortable to stay in, but they didn't have to, [_as Mordan noticed_](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6716) their trespassing soon enough. Not to worry, since they escaped using the magic map.\r\n\r\nAs they dodged paying for the room, fellow witch Nerissa called for them to meet by the wagon. It seemed that just the three of them for the Coven was not enough... [They can corrupt more innocents](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6824) to indoctrinate and add to their numbers. The Fluffy and Fuzzy Ones, in particular, were a splendid choice. Libestal was strange and chaotic. To protect themselves, it was best to band together. The five of them were much more at ease with each other; even when their memories, except Shiori's, were fragmented and incomplete, there was a gravity that pulled them to each other. A dark bond reforged in the trials they recently faced.\r\n\r\n[Advent of Rebellion](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6938)\r\n\r\n[Fire, Fire, Light the Fire!](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=7053)\r\n\r\nEven as Advent affirmed in this timeline, there were still a few things to remember from Shiori and Bijou's short stay. A little view of their own, GothRock wouldn't be remiss, a home that saw many of the events transpire. Even the outside toilet may be missed. So, they lingered for a moment before writing about their final day. And to make the [final entry special](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=7478), Shiori grabbed the diary in the latrine for that final smelly majestic use.\r\n\r\n[A Picture with ~~Gonathan~~ Gigi](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=7270)\r\n\r\nAfter much waiting, the not-red banquet had begun! Everyone cheered as the second part of their journey was officially over, letting out \"Huzzahs\" and firing fireworks into the flammable decor of the Great Hall. Shiori watched from the sidelines, celebrating with them as she ate a bit before the food could be served. She enjoyed the moment for just that. A moment. Jubilation and \"wooden shovels\" consumed the conversations Shiori could hear, though that didn't matter for long. Soon, Shiori Nyavella's role will end, and a new one will begin.\r\n\r\nA scream echoed through the castle, and soon it would be heard throughout Libestal. Shiori let out a small laugh.\r\n\r\nA voice thundered through the halls as malice filled the air.\r\n\r\n(See:[Outlander-Iphania](#edge:iphania-outlander)).\r\n\r\n**_Nothing Stays Pure_**\r\n\r\nIt was cute to see the heroes swear to try and save the world after failing... was it twice now? Pitiable. Shiori watched the Time Warden, or lovely _Queen Tam Gandr_ in this tale, promise Fia, the original _Iphania_, a brighter future. To try to overturn the Chains of Fate once more.\r\n\r\nWell, we can't have that now, can we? Repeating the same story so soon would be rather... stale. A good continuation needs a little change to set up a new arc with new challenges for our _beloved_ heroes to face. But like with every story, an antagonist is needed.\r\n\r\nEvery hero has a villain—be it herself, nature, or _another_.\r\n\r\n\"You think you can just set things right... Fix what's broken?\"\r\n\r\nShiori Nyavella tried her best to be kind to those around her; though she may be a bit mischievous at times, it was mostly harmless. True, some appreciated her kindness, but there are those the Archiver's eyes lingered on a few of Shiori's... former friends; there are those who were un*just*ly cruel to Nyavella.\r\n\r\nShiori's golden eyes glowed as she turned to the three goddess-like beings, avatars who were part of a Council that became a Promise, who stood against Advent. Her gaze caught, and she smirked. It looks like her little coven of witches, Shiori's Advent, _won't_ be quite alone in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n**Bonds** forged yesterday are now **broken** today.\r\n\r\n\"Who's...

            "content": "**SHADOW**\r\n\r\nThere she stood. Awake in the dead of the night, [staring back at her portrait](https://youtu.be/MXqotm_8_Hc?t=228), entranced, she drowned in the deafening silence of a seemingly peaceful evening. Deep within, there was a storm brewing. All that pain she suffered from unrequited love... the anxiety that crawls into every bit of her nerves… The jealousy that stabbed her in the back gradually coalesced to form a maelstrom that could wreak havoc on anyone who stood in her way.\r\n\r\nShe was ready to exact revenge.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**BLOOD IN THE BREEZE**\r\n\r\nBreaking from her own \"spell\", she went about her way, [killing the remnants of the stains](https://youtu.be/MXqotm_8_Hc?t=483) that were left after the salvage of Libestal, destroying everything that came across her. Even an innocent cow was not spared from this woman’s rage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**GAMBLING WITH FATE?**\r\n\r\nOf course, nothing was more satisfying than spending time gambling after a hard day’s work. It was like opium—a drug that excited all her senses. The risk of losing and gaining had been quite the hobby for her. Much like losing oneself in the name of love. This time, it seems, it had become stronger than ever before.\r\n\r\nShe placed her lot—first, on all colors except blue. Although there was more to it than merely placing one’s bets. For she talked with the voices more audibly now that it did not matter if someone heard her. And her words… sounded deep and allegorical as she compared the persistence of colors at the strike of luck with how one persists in the hands of fate.\r\n\r\n_“What is it you’re hoping for?”_\r\n\r\nNerissa felt rather than heard the words, her eyes fixated, determined, ahead. The color cannon was now loaded, and the voices continued to rise in volume as they placed their bets on the last surviving color… Inwardly, she argued and questioned why, despite all impossibility, some voices still insisted on asking for \"red\". Why, after all, keep holding onto hope? Why keep praying for miracles? When blue is inevitable. A destiny that could hardly be defied.\r\n\r\nAnother round went by; the voices continued to risk everything for the slightest chance of victory, while Nerissa kept denying herself any form of optimism, fully convinced that she could not escape her fate… that she did not need any saving.\r\n\r\nBut what if salvation comes in the color of scarlet? Brave. Persistent. Full of hope.\r\n\r\nHer telekinesis device rang. It was a call from Lady Bloodflame. The fair knight asked her whereabouts, and as soon as she learned where, she immediately went up to meet her. As if providence was trying to prove the “Witch” wrong, “Red” stormed in to snatch her away from despair.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**LIKE A BURNING SUN**\r\n\r\nElizabeth came, and a light flickered in the jet-black room in her heart. That tiny flame, could it consume the darkness clouding her soul? The fair knight kept coming closer, and every time it felt like a scorching sun burning through her skin. It was not pleasant; thus, she tried to remain cold and distant. Unreciprocating her advances.\r\n\r\nWill she truly be able to resist the knight's sweet gestures? Or would she finally show weakness and yield to her first love? (see: [Nerissa-Elizabeth](#edge:liz-nerissa))\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**RENEGADES**\r\n\r\n“_It seems like everyone is getting their happy ending_,” Nerissa muttered.\r\n\r\nHer feelings were rather ambivalent, as if perhaps she was unsure about her own ending. Was it malice, forming deep within her heart? Or maybe it was uncertainty, the victory over the Heart of Ruin feeling unsatisfactory or incomplete to her? There was something odd about it all, afterall. All the clues she had gathered seemingly pointed to a different direction. Perhaps that last tome might have held more answers, if only she could have deciphered its obscure language.\r\n\r\nOne thing was for certain, however- something was wrong, and it was up to her to act on it.\r\n\r\nRight before the victory banquet started, Nerissa [met up with Shiori Nyavella who happened to be with Princess Bijou](https://youtu.be/MXqotm_8_Hc?t=7518), who then claimed to have just become a witch. The jeweler expressed her desire to learn more from them, and the two were \"kind\" enough to accept her as apprentice. Shiori inquired if it would just be the three of them, to which Nerissa replied perhaps they could recruit two more. Thus, they called the Fluffy One and the Fuzzy One, for certainly, no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nFrom henceforth, they shall be called \"Coven Rebellion\".\r\n\r\nWould this coven be just another harmless faction? Or would they be a threat to the renewed peace in Libestal?\r\n\r\n(see [Iphania-Outlander](#edge:iphania-outlander))\r\n\r\n## Fan Arts\r\n\r\n[Coven Rebellion](https://x.com/DiChwis12652/status/1922518834847625230)\r\n[Witches](https://x.com/haaro_69/status/1922094444339462652)",

            "content": "As with the others, today was a day of celebration and goodbyes. Though, surprisingly, new bonds formed as well.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t a day without some eavesdropping either. She had woken up on Shiori’s bed again, coming off a dream about watching Pokémon movies. Shiori was already up, writing someone’s commission in the center of the room. Bijou warped away just as she finished to avoid getting caught.\r\n\r\nShe comes across Shiori anyway in the library. They theorize what may happen at the banquet; surely nothing bad will happen, right? ……Right?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBijou realized she had not completed the library’s lore archives for herself, so she set off to collect the books she had missed. She was essentially taking a walk through memory lane through the areas the warriors had wandered this past week. Upon collecting them all, she started reading them out loud to herself and the voices in her head.\r\n\r\nCecilia Immerkind also came by while she was reading. The delusional knight was fully aware that they would leave this point in time soon. Bijou assures her that everyone’s memories of each other, the Libestans, and the adventures of the past week will be remembered.\r\n\r\nThat was her reasoning for collecting all the books she could find, after all.\r\n\r\n[Reading the Library Lore Archives](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBijou happened to stop by the Hot Pink One’s house, [overhearing](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=3830) a talk between her and Immerkind. Seeing her at the door, HPO immediately asked why she was next to… “the murderer” (Mococo was next to her outside, referring to yesterday’s “incident”).\r\n\r\nAs if the trauma of yesterday wasn’t enough, the HPO got a letter… from her consort (see [Hot Pink One](#node:irys)). Queen Tam also showed up at this time, though IRyS [demanded](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4028) that her brother stay away from her.\r\n\r\nBijou started to feel suffocated in the tense atmosphere. She clutched her map to cope, but even that didn’t feel like enough. As if by magic, the appearance of the fluffy one was able to calm her down. Her presence alone was able to soothe her.\r\n\r\n[Headpat me! Headpat me!](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4066)\r\n\r\nGuiding map in hand, Bijou continued to eavesdrop anyway. She had to call her sister to check in with her, but… she was at Mordan's house auction.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nApparently, it was true that Ina was to set out on a journey following the victory banquet. Though, she still needed a house to come back to, so she wanted to join the auction.\r\n\r\nBijou supported her sister’s journey to find her revelation. She also realizes she has a home to return to of her own, the one of her dearly belove. She was content with sharing it with her. Even though she knew a body may soon be buried underneath.\r\n\r\n…But she would bid for one of the houses anyway. [“Seven thousand!”](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4531) (_She only had 5,485 coins remaining._)\r\n\r\nThe final day would not have been complete without one huge scandal, now would it? After Shakira and Roa won the second house auction, Ina [began to realize](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=46806) her house design had been stolen by Mordan…\r\n\r\nPeasant Bae was thinking of snatching the last house as part of her retaliation, but Bijou decided to take it into her own hands on her sister’s behalf.\r\n\r\n[STOP THE AUCTION!](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4820)\r\n\r\nAn argument ensued between Ina and Mordan, which ended in the latter running away. Everyone chased her down like a mob with pitchforks and torches. Like a light switch, the topic suddenly changed to the victory banquet. Problem solved! I guess?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMordan also had the bright idea of taking a group photo before the banquet, anticipating the end of their time in Past Libestal.\r\n\r\nTheir first stop was the **library**, where this chapter started. Without Fia, they would not have been saved from the false Libestal and taken back in time. Bijou was called out for being short and thus was put front and center. She was the one to take the picture though!\r\n\r\n[A photo for the archives](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5062)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe banquet was not for another 40 minutes, so the warriors decided to take more group photos on their own.\r\n\r\nBijou called the jewelers for a group photo at [Gacharm](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5232). Though it was Roa’s business in the end, the sparkling gem pulled a lot of weight on her own. She developed the gacha ticket system, and she worked tirelessly to craft and mine for the charms they sold. Arguably, the success of the business came from her—the literal jewel of the company.\r\n\r\nThey first took a photo while flying in front of the [floating sign](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5442) above the shop—it was Mococo’s first time with the Magic Feather. Then they went inside for one last photo.\r\n\r\n[Tiny treasures, infinite pleasure!](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5552)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSoon after the four jewelers finished taking group photos, they received word from on high that the banquet was to start in 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nBijou’s map led her to Mordan’s tavern; there was a commotion coming from underground, and she could hear all of it…\r\n\r\nIt was the last day—she decided to [break the first rule of The Basement](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5625) within earshot of Mordan. She came outside and retaliated, and so did Nerissa.\r\n\r\n“DON’T TREAT MY BROTHER LIKE THAT!” It was IRyS. Bijou wasn’t fazed by what had just happened; she was fine. They touched base about Ina and what Bijou told her.\r\n\r\nIt seems like there might still be a chance for the couple—at least that’s what IRyS thinks, assuming what Kronii got from Ina was a rejection letter. [“Why are you laughing like that?”](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5728)\r\n\r\nShe [called her stepmom](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5854) in response to the suspicious laughter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe time of the banquet drew closer.\r\n\r\nA brief detour after the call led Bijou and down a [random hole](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5970) someone seemed to have dug down. They went further down and were surprised by how far down they could reach.\r\n\r\nShiori noticed this too. She theorized a plan for the future to make a secret tunnel system under everyone’s homes. Perhaps for another time, on another adventure.\r\n\r\nPeasant Bae would later come to [buy](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6257) the last house from earlier, only for a measly 2000 coins. At least she’s not homeless anymore. That’s good, right? Hope the children are happy now. Forget the fact that the roof is lopsided.\r\n\r\nSince everyone was busy taking pictures, Shiori and Bijou [visited the tavern](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6508) one last time. It was only cut short as Mordan drew near. Though they didn’t get to see The Basement, their bond seemed to have improved from their short visit.\r\n\r\nThe two teleported and ran far away from the tavern. Soon after, Shiori got a call from Nerissa to meet up. They do so near the wagon. Now, as a member of her coven, Bijou expresses great eagerness to learn her witchy ways sometime in the future.\r\n\r\nIt was brought up that they could try [recruiting](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6725) some innocent ones. Fuwawa and Mococo came to mind immediately. Fuwawa’s worth as a chef was proven near the end of the week, while Mococo was all about the money from the start.\r\n\r\nArguably, they could use a little guidance. The fluffy and fuzzy ones were summoned, and together they all formed an alliance. From that day forward, they all vowed to protect one another. The Coven “Rebellion” had been formed. The voices in their heads stirred, almost as if this particular group of five was destined to be!\r\n\r\n[An **Advent** of something new…](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6784)\r\n\r\nTo commemorate this moment, they took a [group photo](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6895) together; they were among one of the last to gather for one. Tam, Immerkind, and Gonathan helped take photos for them as well.\r\n\r\n_”The banquet will begin in 5 minutes.”_\r\n\r\nNow of their own coven, Shiori and Bijou said their farewells to the Building Area, and by extension their house. Bijou decided to carry her egg and one of Shiori’s seeds with her.\r\n\r\nShe took a pit stop at the outhouse before they left for the banquet. …But she took this as an excuse to “love maps” one last time, overhearing a photo op between Gonathan and Shiori. Even as she was summoned to the Great Hall, she decided to sneak in [one last journal entry](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=7324) and a selfie with her knight Immerkind before leaving.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe banquet was finally about to happen. The warriors gathered at the [Great Hall](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=7428), practically jumping in their seats in excitement. Everyone said their last goodbyes in advance; for Bijou, she bid farewell to her sister.\r\n\r\n…This was their final moment of peace. Their celebration would be interrupted by divine forces beyond their control.\r\n\r\n(See [Outlander-Iphania](#edge:iphania-outlander))\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**_Only continue after reading [the last card](#node:fia)._**\r\n\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\n\\\r\nNothing stays pure forever, they say.\r\n\r\nOur innocent former princess… may not be so pure after all, after what she’s gone through this past week. _...So much for reform._\r\n\r\nWe’ll see what the next chapter brings.\r\n\r\n[M̷͕͎̤͔̒̄͗́͊͝ͅā̵̧̺̙̞̭y̷͕̐ ̶̫̺̝̥̐͗̃͑̀͝t̷̯̦͔̥͉̋̈́͘h̴͕͐̀̅̚͝e̵̛̬̲̙̠̜͗̏̈́̑̄ ̵̨̨͉͈̩͍̐͊͛l̴̩͇͒́̿̓͘͜͝ǎ̷͓̙̬͕̝͉͆̈́̊̄̓n̵̙̻͒̈́̐͐d̴̲̬̊s͕̱̫̘͓͕̼͍͙͐ ̶̫̺̝̥̐͗̃͑̀͝b̶̥̅͛̆͑͘̕u̵̩̩̣͙͎͊̾r̸̹͉̳̯̙̹͛̅̈̐͗͂n̸̡̦̜̎̈́͝](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=8151)",

            "title": "Gonathon G",
            "content": "**Justice is Blind**\r\n\r\nThe day started almost eerily calm for the humble knight. With a few hours to burn before the victory banquet, Gonathon busied himself by unearthing the final tomes of lore that still eluded her abount the kingdom. His thoughts drifting back to Immerkind (see [Cecilia-Gonathon](edge:cecilia-gigi)), Gonathon decided that the best way he could help his lovesick friend was to win a house for her in Mordan Ramsey’s upcoming auction. Reviewing his funds and informing Immerkind of his plan, Gonathon made his way back to the common area.\r\n\r\nSwiftly winning the auction and gifting Immerkind the house, the two shared a heartfelt conversation in which they once again reaffirmed the vows of the pack, no matter how far apart they might be. They were quickly joined by Tam Gandr and Mordan Ramsey, and, following a rousing rant by the queen on their victory over the Hot Pink One (see [Gonathon-Kronii](edge:gigi-kronii)), [the wolf pack gathered all of its members for a final photograph](https://www.youtube.com/live/IWNcqsQxuWo?si=Px7ylmWgbXcz0b0J&t=5630), a memento of the unbreakable bond they shared.\r\n\r\nFollowing one last adventure to collect lore with Tam and Immerkind, Gonathon encountered Elizabeth and Roa. Despite Roa, Liz, Immerkind, and Gonathon having no discernible link in this world, the four could not deny the innate kinship they felt and decided to take a picture together, proclaiming themselves [the Knights of Justice](https://www.youtube.com/live/IWNcqsQxuWo?si=hHBQWw5ZJWqYlvRD&t=6812). Leaving his newfound alliance for the time being, Gonathon paid a visit to Shiori of the Nyavellas (see [Gonathon-Shiori:](#edge:gigi-shiori)). Face-to-face once again with the one who had put him through so much hardship yet taught him so much, Gonathon shared one final conversation and took a photograph with her, a melancholy but optimistic final note on their adventures together. Or at least, that’s what it appeared to be.\r\n\r\nAs Gonathon entered the banquet hall, he was approached by the Outlander, who thanked him for all the work he had done. The mysterious cloaked figure revealed [his secret identity as the Watcher](https://www.youtube.com/live/IWNcqsQxuWo?si=QUzhHUS977EJwG4c&t=7325) and earnestly proclaimed why he wanted to save Princess Iphania, his beloved “sister.” Alas, as if on command, a shrill scream was heard. Rushing to the scene, Gonathon was horrified to find the princess and the Curse—seemingly no worse for wear following their previous battle—was standing over her corpse. The malignant entity taunted Gonathon and the Outlander before disappearing, leaving the shaken knight to parse what had just occurred.\r\n\r\nMeeting with the mysterious Fia, Gonathon was struck with yet another shocking revelation: that the catlike being was in fact Princess Iphania! Setting aside the question of how Shiori could have known about Fia's secret identity, Gonathon vowed to fix the world he had come to love alongside his companions and forge his own path into the future.\r\n\r\nBut the question was, would these companions stand alongside him? For upon regrouping with the other adventurers, the most stupefying twist of all was revealed: Fuwawa, Mococo, Nerissa, Bijou, and their leader Shiori had turned their backs on the cause they had fought so hard for and had going rogue. Locking eyes with Shiori, the Archiver offered yet another seemingly simple choice: [“Are you with us?”](https://www.youtube.com/live/IWNcqsQxuWo?si=DDxWY6Ijue3gNRMc&t=7711)\r\n\r\nSo ends the second journey of Gonathon G. Throughout his many trials, the humble knight has learned the importance of choosing his own path and not simply living as the mindless pawn of others. Despite losing the memories of the one he held most dear, Gonathon remains committed to fighting for what he believes in. But now, with many of his friends, including the one who showed him so much kindness, seemingly standing against the cause he had fought so long and ahrd for, will the humble knight be able to stand firm? Or will he succumb to the temptations offered to him by these malefactors and sink to even greater depths?\r\n\r\n[The last journal](https://www.youtube.com/live/IWNcqsQxuWo?si=NQKNRL3h6Ne5Cmkl)",

The pink one’s [letter](https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=205), filled with passion yet laced with confusion, only deepened the haze surrounding her heart. And so, Ina made her decision: she would write one final letter to her consort before stepping away, seeking peace and clarity in solitude. (see [Hot Pink One–Ina: So Long, Consort](#edge:ina-irys))\n\n[One final \"Dear consort\"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=723)\n\nWith that emotional weight set aside, Ina turned to enjoy what remained of the final day. She hoped for a calm, peaceful time... but peace was never quite guaranteed in this world. What followed was an unexpected dose of comedic frustration: the humble little home she had painstakingly built—bland by some standards but deeply personal to her—was straight-up [plagiarized](https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=1756) for an auction. When she tried to challenge the perpetrator, none other than the insufferably clever Mordon Ramsay, she found herself utterly outmatched.\n\n[You look like a napkin!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=2015)\n\nStill, in the end, it was all in good fun.\n\nShe laughed with the others, took [commemorative photos](https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=2275) with the heroes she had fought beside, and shared warm moments with [her sister](https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=4638). For a time, it truly felt like the perfect ending to a chaotic, emotional, unforgettable journey.\n\nUntil it didn’t.\n\n(See [Princess–Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander))",

            "content": "The Queen woke up with fire in her heart and vindication in mind. It was *on sight* for the Hot Pink One, and she wasted no time telling Immerkind that it was, in fact, HPO who had spread rumors about her being [“far from kind”](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=264) right from day one. Naturally, the kind knight took offense and immediately started grilling the Hot Pink One. The Queen took this distraction as an opportunity to read a letter she’d received from Nino Ina. There was nothing like reading a heartfelt letter while your enemy was getting flamed in the background.\n\nBut alas, one could not win it all. Nino Ina chose not to take up the Queen’s offer to leave HPO and be with her—for Nino Ina did not wish to stray from [the path of a righteous hero](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=296). The Queen looked up at the sky exasperatedly, let out a deep sigh, and began taking out her frustration on HPO once more, who had somehow managed to save face with Immerkind. To this, the Queen remarked, [“Well, you couldn’t save OUR relationship now, could you?!”](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=342)\n\nMore pettiness ensued, rivaling a school playground, if we’re being honest. At this point, Queen Tam and HPO were doing it purely for the love—hate—of the game. The playground squabble was only interrupted when the Queen was approached by Peasant the Bae and the Fluffy One—the latter even offering food for free.\n\nPeople say bravery requires one to be afraid of doing something but do it anyway despite the fear. Whatever possessed the Queen, it certainly was not bravery when she placed a bid of [ten thousand coins](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=785) at Mordon Ramsay’s auction—despite only having a little over a thousand to her name. Perhaps it was her newly regained bravado after her perceived triumph against HPO. Or maybe it was just good old-fashioned fear of missing out on flaunting her authority. The latter seemed more likely, as she backed out the moment it became clear she might actually *win*.\n\nWhile checking out the new home that Immerkind and Gonathon had won from the auction, Queen Tam brought them up to speed on Nino Ina’s response—her decision not to be with either the Queen or HPO. This, in a technical sense, handed the win to Queen Tam, since HPO was now fated to live alone. An [empty and petty win for a petty queen](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1052). But one thing she *did* have that HPO didn’t was the camaraderie and undying support of her fellow wolves in “the Wolfpack.” And so, she, Immerkind, and Gonathon howled in unison.\n\n[“Take a gander at my pettiness.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1261)\n\nNext on the Queen’s agenda was a photoshoot with the other heroes who had helped save the world. Naturally, this included the Hot Pink One—and the Queen wasted no time engaging in their usual routine of shenanigans. She wanted the chair HPO was sitting on. She also remarked about the Hot Pink One having no one left by her side, all while [laughing evilly](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1446).\n\nAfter that came a photoshoot with her [fellow Suppliers](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1774)—Peasant the Bae and Immerkind—courtesy of Gonathon. It was then that the Queen realized there were only three of them in the group. This was followed by yet another shoot, this time with her fellow wolves in the Wolfpack: Gonathon, Immerkind, Shakira, Mordon Ramsay, and Nerissa. They shared their [final howls](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2252) together as Peasant the Bae snapped their photo.\n\nPerhaps driven by a lingering sense of adventure—or simple curiosity about the Kingdom of Libestal in this timeline—Queen Tam formed one last adventuring party with her trusty knights Immerkind and Gonathon. Together, they ventured into the [Remnants of the Antigonian Aerie](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2481) to search for ancient tomes chronicling the kingdom’s lost history. Midway through their journey, the Queen received a [“spam letter\"](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2587) from the Hot Pink One.\n\nAs they continued their small quest, Immerkind and Gonathon began discussing their hopes for the [next grand adventure](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2760): saving Libestal’s griffins from extinction. Gonathon even suggested traveling further back into the past to do just that. The Queen, on the other hand, just wanted to go home. After all, she likely had better things to do than save some random majestic creatures.\n\n[“I... I would love to go home.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2810)\n\nOn their way back to the kingdom for the victory banquet, Queen Tam stumbled upon an [unusual gathering of people](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3089) having their pictures taken: Shiori, Nerissa, Bijou, the Fuzzy One, and the Fluffy One. As far as the Queen knew, the only thing these people had in common was that they’d all been cursed to fight the heroes in the final dungeon and had to be freed from corruption.\n\nStrangely, this inspired Immerkind to do the same. She and Gonathon sent messages to Roa Pandora and Lady Bloodflame, inviting them to take photos [“for justice,”](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3170) as Gonathon put it.\n\nThen the Queen felt it too—deep in her heart, or perhaps from the abyss where the rest of her missing memories lay dormant—[a strong urge to gather Peasant the Bae and even the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3218) to capture their moment as well. The feeling must’ve reached Peasant the Bae too, because she was already calling the Queen with the same idea.\n\nAnd so, on a deserted street—against a backdrop of the vast blue sky fading into space, the lush greens of nature, and the majestic structures of a thriving civilization—the three had their group photo taken.\n\n[“…a promise to keep forever.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3460)\n\nAt last, it was time for the victory banquet. There, Queen Tam and the others enjoyed [fireworks supplied by Peasant the Bae](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3675). The sense of accomplishment was palpable, and spirits were high as the celebration commenced. Soon, the Outlander stepped forward to personally thank each hero for their bravery—for saving him and the kingdom from their grim fate.\n\nThat was when the gears of destiny started again, and the fate of the heroes reached a turning point. (see: [Outlander-Iphania: The Chains of Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander)).\n\nQueen Tam Gandr could scarcely believe what was unfolding before her. Just as a newfound determination to save the world stirred in her chest, a betrayal cracked the bond the heroes had built. And as the [advent of seemingly wicked intentions](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=4199) came from the five individuals who sought to rebel, the Queen felt her strength drain from her body—and was claimed by slumber once more.\n\nOnly time will tell when the Queen shall rise again.",

With the wave of her hand, the crushing power bearing down on them dissipated, granting the heroes a breath of relief. Then, with calm resolve, she spoke—not just to clarify what had happened, but to reveal the truth of who she truly was.\n\nShe was Iphania.\n\nThe Princess of Libestal.\n\nIn the world she hailed from, the Curse had not been completely vanquished. At the moment of its defeat, it latched onto her cherished doll, embedding a fragment of itself within it—silent, patient, waiting. And when the time was right, it struck. Iphania was slain... or should have been. Yet in the same moment of her demise, something miraculous happened. Her consciousness, bound by the doll’s magic and sheer will, slipped away into the flow of time and space—until it eventually found its way to the Library.\n\nThere, she was reborn as Fia, the Librarian.\n\nThough she assumed a new role, she never stopped thinking about the home she lost. Nor could she forget the nameless hero—the Outlander—who had fought so desperately to save her. It became her deepest wish: to save them both.\n\nThat wish reignited when she witnessed the heroes break through the prison that had trapped the Outsider, or to be more specific, the Outlander, defeating the Stain King and setting him free. She knew then—they were her hope. Her Shining Stars. The ones who could defy fate.\n\nEven now, despite the knowledge that the Outsider’s birth was inevitable, there was still time to change what would come after. And so she extended her hand, asking them to stand with her in one final fight—to defy the impossible, and to create a future beyond fate’s design.\n\nMost of them answered her call.\n\n...\n\nBut not all.\n\n[Nothing stays pure forever](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?t=7224)\n\nFuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori did not.\n\nSomething had changed within them.

They had no interest in saving the world nor the Outlander. \"Eventually, the people you trust... the people you admire... they all turn on you.\"\n\nThey were done trusting. Done hoping. They would forge their own path—one shaped not by fate, nor by gods, nor by promises. They declared it proudly.\n\nA rebellion.\n\nAnd they welcomed anyone who might wish to join them.",

It was only as the banquet drew near that Knight and Archiver would reunite, with Gonathon requesting a [picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWNcqsQxuWo&t=6859s) of just the two of them.

It was here that a shocking revelation was made: that Fia was in fact the Princess! This in turn raised a foreboding question: were Shiori's comments about the princess and Fia being one the previous day a mere coincidence, or did the archiver know more than she was letting on? \n\nResolving to do whatever it took to fix the world, Gonathon and her companions seemed set to embark upon a new journey... that was until five sinister figures made their presence known.

With these sudden revelations, several quandaries begin to surface. Did Shiori remove her memories to spare herself the pain of them, or was it to prepare herself for her betrayal of Gonathon? Would Gonathon be able to resist the Archiver's offer, given the oath she swore to her? And who exactly was this \"G\" that Shiori claimed was another version of Gonathon?",

According to the Origin, the fate of Libestal had long since been sealed—doomed beyond salvation. The Watcher’s duty was to observe, never to interfere. And for the longest time, he accepted that.\n\nBut then, he met Princess Iphania.\n\nDespite the overwhelming despair that surrounded her kingdom, she never gave up. She defied fate, fought to her last breath, and inspired hope in even the most desolate hearts. Her unwavering resolve moved the Outlander, and he began to question everything he believed in. It was that very resolve that led him to cast aside his role, to abandon the will of the Origin, and to take up a sword to fight as a nameless warrior at the Princess’s side.\n\nHe thanked the heroes, deeply and sincerely, for shouldering the consequences in his stead, bearing the task of striking down the Curse—defying divine decree to save the world. But a question lingered in his mind: how did they know all this? How did they seem to already understand the truths he had just now revealed?\n\nHe never got an answer.\n\n[A small talk before the turning point](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?t=6695)\n\nTheir conversation was shattered by a sudden, piercing scream.\n\nRushing to the source, they found Iphania collapsed on the floor—lifeless. And looming above her was the Curse, somehow still alive, having survived what should’ve been its destruction at the hands of the heroes. It had returned.\n\nThe shock turned to horror. And then, chaos.\n\nA mysterious figure appeared, speaking cryptically of punishment—for the Outlander, for the heroes, for defying the will of the Origin. The atmosphere turned oppressive, divine, terrifying.\n\nBut just as judgment was about to fall, a voice rang out. Familiar. Steady. Comforting.\n\nIt was Fia.\n\n(see [Fia](#node:fia))",

First, she made sure to receive the fanfic commission she had requested from Shiori yesterday. She acquired an available room in Calli's tavern with extra jukebox amenities and a clear window. Kiara bought two invisibility potions as well—this would prove useful later. As if that wasn't enough, she also asked Immerkind for a lesson on how to thrust... if you know what that means.\n\nKiara and Roa meet at Calli's tavern. \n\nTo set the steamy atmosphere, Kiara read the fanfic, which aroused her wife. Roa and Kiara both then drank the potions and proceeded to *\"have fun\"* in bed.\n\n[There they learned to be one's kneaded pizza to another's sloppy spaghetti—with a little bit of pet play...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8E8Dsgs5e50?si=Cfv40DbMZLJijbq9&t=2031)\n\nAfter...*that*, Roa suggested buying a house from Calli's auction—even offering her last 4000 coins to help pay for it. [Kiara kept raising her own bid on a large house, which she ended up winning anyway.](https://www.youtube.com/live/8E8Dsgs5e50?si=RxtfN_wMGm29Xkzv&t=3612)\n\nThe two moved into their new home fairly quickly, setting up their beds together and putting away their spicy fanfiction. \n\n[A photo of the newlyweds.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8E8Dsgs5e50?si=ekcHIcDyu86fONhG&t=5322)\n\nAnd so, there was their happy ending... or perhaps a beginning to a new chapter in their marriage.",
