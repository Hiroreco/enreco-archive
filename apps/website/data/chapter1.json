      "dayRecap": "## Day 1: The Chains of Employment\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Libestal has returned—but something is… off. Our heroes have traveled back in time?! As if the whole “the King was evil and the old kingdom was a fabricated illusion” twist wasn’t enough, now we’ve got _time travel_ thrown into the mix. But alright, maybe it’s not so bad, they just need to—oh, they’ve also lost their memories. Again???\r\n\r\nForget the bonds, the connections, the whole history they’d built up—our heroes now begin anew. A new kingdom, new lives, even new identities. But one thing hasn’t changed: their mission to recover their shattered memories and, somehow, save the world—no, the universe—from the great evil known as the _Outsider_.\r\n\r\nThe Ancient Kingdom of Libestal also brings new systems for the heroes to learn. Guilds are gone, replaced by _Jobs_, and each hero is free to choose the path they wish to walk:\r\n\r\n- **The Smith:** Crafts upgrade stones used to enhance Revelation Weapons.\r\n- **The Jeweler:** Crafts charms that boost health and defense.\r\n- **The Chef:** Cooks meals that grant adventuring buffs.\r\n- **The Supplier:** Enchants tools, improving resource gathering.\r\n\r\n![The job selection area](/images-opt/jobs.webp)\r\n\r\nThe kingdom itself has undergone a makeover too. With a strong wooden motif, it carries a distinctly medieval vibe. No tyrannical King this time—replacing him is Princess Iphania, the current ruler. Alongside her is a mysterious talking cat named Fia, who manages a place known as the _Library_.\r\n\r\nThe Library holds the memories of everything, and it's now tended by lorekeepers, Calli and Kiara, who work with Fia to archive the new stories our heroes will forge. At the end of each day, everyone is expected to write a diary entry about their journey and submit it to the Library.\r\n\r\n![The Library with Fia](/images-opt/library.webp)\r\n\r\nHow will any of this help save the universe? Who knows? But it's only Day 1—the start of a new adventure, a chance to forge new bonds and rediscover old ones. Forget world-saving for now. First, our heroes need to get a grip on their new lives and roles, because before anything else, they need to _pay the bills_.\r\n\r\n[Monster - ENigmatic Recollection Chapter 2 Theme Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUrITFpI85A&ab_channel=hololiveEnglish)",

            "content": "The fluffy one’s beginning mirrored that of all the others—she was given the rundown of her situation, her mission, and the state she was in: missing a piece of her memories. She was understandably confused, but, as always, she faced her new reality with quiet resolve. Just like in her past journey, she accepted her role and duties without hesitation.\n\nWhen asked to choose an occupation, Fuwawa became a chef. Her reason was simple and heartfelt: she wanted to bring people together through food, to create joyful moments with her cooking—a touching motive that fit her perfectly.\n\n[Fluffy food for everyone](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/-zBlbI-EuCw?si=nzN8c0Pw0-r-m8IK&t=1696)\n\nAnd so her new adventure began. Thanks to the familiarity of the kingdom’s mechanics from her previous life, the fluffy one had a much easier time settling into this strange, yet oddly familiar world. Along the way, she encountered old acquaintances—or perhaps new ones? With her memories fragmented, she couldn’t be sure. She remembered her beloved bread lady, [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/-zBlbI-EuCw?si=wV_c4zN2N9MCFymM&t=5394), but drew a blank on the striking Blue Maiden before her. So she gave her a name of her own:\n\n[Miss Mustard](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zBlbI-EuCw&t=3399s)\n\nThen came the cooking. She was a chef, after all. From soups to potato salads, Fuwawa happily prepared meal after meal. It quickly became clear she had made the right decision—cooking was easy, fun, and most importantly, fulfilling.\n\nShe spent time exploring the kingdom, inspecting the [kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zBlbI-EuCw&t=8953s) she would come to know well, and even visited the gallery where she stumbled upon a nostalgic painting of herself from a past she could still recall.\n\n[The chickens...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/-zBlbI-EuCw?si=EsVMxO7nW5FLNBdj&t=9049)\n\nAs the day came to a close, the doggo continued doing what she loved. She even attempted to bake a cake—though that endeavor didn’t go quite as planned, and she ultimately gave up. Still, it was a sweet and fluffy end to a sweet and fluffy start.",

She didn’t question it at all. Sure, she had trouble remembering people who were once close to her, like [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv6DAiZLbUk&t=823s), and others she was only vaguely familiar with, like [Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=KUz2qVX6vM0F-4ff&t=2737)—but beyond that, she was remarkably unbothered.\r\n\r\nMaybe, in some strange way, it was a blessing. A clean slate. A sweet release from the trail of crimes she’d left behind in her last adventure. Wrongfully suing a local business, corrupting the land, singlehandedly wiping out all of Fuwawa’s chickens in one fell swoop—this new journey was her chance at redemption.\r\n\r\nShe chose to be a jeweler this time. Why? Simple. Shiny things. Shiny things meant money. And Mococo loves money—we all know this. So the choice made perfect sense.\r\n\r\n[Me like shiny](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=_C3pZF1YEMxXEZ0S&t=1825)\r\n\r\nAnd so the fuzzy one’s journey began. Like everyone else, she had to learn the ropes of this new world. Of course, she made the most of her amnesia along the way—using it as a convenient excuse to mess with others for her own [amusement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv6DAiZLbUk&t=3798s). She dove straight into mining, digging up shiny gems and jewels, the sparkle of which lit up her eyes with [dollar signs](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=rNUGrnLRv6cy2cIy&t=4350). Her love for money hadn’t changed one bit, and she made that clear—yes, even if it involved a little [violence](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=X8jas4hawvrGxh2Y&t=6315).\r\n\r\nNot much else happened—it was only Day 1, after all. And honestly? That was probably for the best. After how chaotic things got for Mococo last time, she could use a bit of peace. Time to refresh her mind, perhaps become a kinder, gentler soul. Sure, she was still a little obsessed with cash, but who isn’t? At the very least, she didn’t have to worry about lottery tickets anymore. She could live her life, make her own choices, and—oh no, Mococo, no! She found the gambling machine!\r\n\r\n[Here we go again](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Fv6DAiZLbUk?si=xxcTjEyCBICYhYy1&t=9886)",

            "title": "Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame",
            "content": "Right as she was regaining her composure after a long slumber—ever since the battle against the corrupted King—Elizabeth suddenly found herself thrown into a place that somewhat resembled a library, where a cat named Fia greeted her and explained the current situation.\n\nThere was a lot to take in, but one detail stood out to Elizabeth more than anything else: she had been brought back in time to an earlier state of Libestal. Her memories were fractured, and she was told she would need to recover them beyond the kingdom’s walls.\n\nElizabeth found this peculiar. She could still recall everything—her battles, her comrades, the life she once lived. But not everyone could say the same. When she met Mococo again, the latter didn’t even [recognize her](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=7Td3cbu0PPDJkx27&t=606).\n\nAfter some discussion about the Library's mechanics with Kiara and Calli, Elizabeth eventually met with the Princess, who further clarified the current state of things.\n\nHaving had enough of the info dump, Elizabeth’s new journey began. Like everyone else, she needed to learn the ropes of this unfamiliar kingdom. A lot had changed: the guilds were no more, her Jade Sword guildmaster was nowhere to be found, and her former guildmates didn’t even remember her clearly. Her status as a knight who once protected the kingdom no longer held any meaning. Instead, she was told she had to… get a job.\n\n[Elizabeth \"Smith\" Bloodflame](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=NAyI0H-VdaVYmt1i&t=1901)\n\nFrom a noble knight to working minimum wage—what a downgrade. Still, Elizabeth was dutiful, and she took on the challenge. After some thought, she chose to become a smith, even crafting a quirky title for herself to match the role.\n\nBut of course, her journey was anything but smooth. Just moments after signing up for her job, the Red Knight—turned smith—ran into a very familiar face she absolutely did _not_ want to see: Tam Gandr. A big meany. However, this time something felt… different.\n\n[Hmm, she's not mean](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=cub9RWxGvm1oH9sK&t=2105)\n\nTam didn’t seem to remember who Elizabeth was, which strangely delighted the Red Maiden. The obnoxious, self-proclaimed queen was no more. But fate wasn’t so kind, for there was another blue maiden Elizabeth would've rather remained forgotten (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: She’s jesting, right?](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\nEven Elizabeth’s ex-daughter, Koseki Bijou, had no recollection of her. And with that, Elizabeth slowly realized—maybe this wasn’t a joke. Maybe she really _was_ one of the few who had retained her memories. Was she sad? Was she shocked? Not really. She just felt… tired. Being thrown back in time, forced to adapt to a new life on the spot, and now the people she once held close couldn’t even remember her? Mentally, it was draining.\n\nStill, she pressed on. Maybe by focusing on her tasks, she could push those feelings aside. That plan didn’t exactly pan out either. Elizabeth was terrible with directions—[_very_ terrible](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=y_o1ps5Fsgg5Gp0T&t=2561). While others zipped through their new jobs, she was constantly lost, repeatedly [struggling](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=k7qXNc2nNN22aSHQ&t=3331) to figure out where to go next, to the point she broke character and yelled out in sheer indignation.\n\n[_I miss my horse..._](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=PnLljHdIk11Y8jBm&t=3454)\n\nEventually, after taking thousands of misdirected steps, she started to figure things out. Things began to look up. She chatted with [others](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=ECQ3WNgCsEOouRSU&t=4018), cracked some [terrible jokes](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=HRKqbzfBMQze3nLm&t=4666), and discovered that her sword could [shoot fire](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=rj1mAKCPPbUAYG2p&t=4782). She even managed to sneak up on Ina to prank her.\n\n[Potato Fairy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=R8Vy2HffirjAtLMt&t=6674)\n\nAs a smith, her role was to craft and upgrade weapons—both for herself and for others. But Elizabeth, wielder of a massive claymore, was more of a swinger than a maker. The whole smithing thing [confused](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=sigydwBMx8Bvvkd-&t=7247) her, so in the end, she gave up on the job—at least for now.\n\nInstead, she chose to build herself a [humble home](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=HlRR5c81lqUhhU2P&t=10915). She painted it green, a nod to her days as a Jade Sword member—something small to bring her comfort in a world where most of her friends had forgotten her. And so, her new adventure began, a lonely but determined march through the mystery that is Libestal.\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"KNIGHT GANG\" by Achicvc](https://x.com/Another_achicvc/status/1922911239631516123)",

            "content": "Tanakisha Karia—or rather, Kiara Takahashi—had her memories returned, though some parts remained a blur. What happened in the end? A fierce battle of epic proportions?\n\nThe mystery didn't last long as a [voice](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=471) reminded her.\n\nShe told Kiara of the Outsider who tricked everyone into freeing him. How his hate would consume millions of worlds if not stopped. Thankfully, there was a way to stop him.\n\nKiara soon found herself in a strange Library, one caught between time and space. A mysterious librarian, [Fia](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=753), explained who the Outsider is, how the Libestal they knew was but a mirage, and the key to the Outsider's defeat. Unfortunately, the latter is unknown as Fia's memories were also lost. In order to save the world, Kiara must bravely venture back to Ancient Libestal and find everyone's memories.\n\nWith that in mind, Kiara and Mori Calliope (also known as Mordan Ramsey) were designated as the official Lorekeepers of the Library and relayed their mission to their fellow heroes. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, Kiara spoke of keeping a journal daily to record the events so nothing goes amiss.\n\nWith hope in their hearts, they all set forth towards their adventures, soon meeting the last Royal of Libestal, [Princess Iphania](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=1374). The Princess told a tale of how Ruination had destroyed her kingdom and family, how a Book of Prophecies foretold the end of everything in seven days. Though the brave Princess does not know whether or not Kiara's mission would align with her own, she allows the heroes to stay in the kingdom to prepare.\n\n[For a hammer](#embed:https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=1876)\n\nDespite her overqualifications to be a chef, Kiara decided that being a smith would benefit her in the long run. With her prowess and her sword, being a smith will only lead to this beautiful Knight becoming stronger.\n\nAfter slight difficulty in reading the map—the effects of time travel still lingered—Kiara eventually made her way and soon heard word of Stains roaming the kingdom and left to vanquish them. On the way there, Kiara found Elizabeth and was relieved to see that she too recalled their previous adventure.\n\n[Lost in only direction](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=2908)—but never in heart. Kiara eventually made her way to the Remnants, and before she could procure the materials essential to a smith, she must first take care of the Stains. Hard fought, almost defeated, but by the timely appearance of others, they secured a safe victory.\n\nAlong the way, Kiara met many of her companions. Though perplexed by the youths of today, who seemed to prefer speaking through the floor. Kiara made wonderful connections, such as forming a kindred spirit with fellow orange smith Gonathon and finding a possible cousin with Cecilia Immerkind due to the common language they speak and a mutual appreciation for kindness (see [Kiara-Cecilia](#edge:cecilia-kiara)).\n\nFocusing on the quests beforehand to prepare for the coming days, Kiara gained more experience as a smith and began trading her goods with others free of charge, for her Noble Spirit as a Knight shines ever bright. Not everyone is in agreement with Kiara's ideals, as Roa Pandora and her employees, the former Princess Bijou and Mococo, enforced [capitalistic ideals](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=9621). Against all odds, and perhaps due to Kiara's kind nature, she may have convinced Bijou that fairer trades could be made—not just ones with gold.\n\nSoon, Elizabeth calls Kiara to the building area, a large plot of land that our heroes are free to use as they see fit, and shows her the beginnings of their shop. Kiara [marveled](https://www.youtube.com/live/5pgqtkxazUo?si=7diOGxuprXPr80Zl&t=11622) at the craftsmanship Elizabeth showed but was appalled that the other knight was too humble, leaving herself only the area under the stairs to rest, and insisted they share the upper floor.\n\nA knight's and hero's work is never done, especially as the deadline looms. Tired, Kiara writes in her journal before departing to rest, pondering what tomorrow could bring.\n\n[Liebes Tagebuch](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5pgqtkxazUo?si=o9cCRFjDiz3cwnjr&t=13675)",

But before they could talk, a darkness enveloped them all, and an unknown voice spoke.\n\n[The Outsider](#embed:https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=454)\n\nA mysterious cat named Fia brought Bae and her maybe-friends back to the past, in an abandoned temple hides the Library, a special place that exists between worlds. There, she told them of the Outsider, the one who donned the King's skin and tricked them into freeing him from his prison. The Libestal they knew was but an illusion to keep the Outsider locked in, but now that he runs free, millions of worlds are now in jeopardy.\n\nBut there is a way to stop him...\n\nIn the past, before the Outsider truly came to be, Peasant The Bae could be the hero the world needs. The key to their victory lies in the missing memories of all our heroes and Fia. Star-shaped crystals, the form their memories took, are scattered throughout the world. With each memory recovered, the power of their Revelation would be strengthened, and they would grow closer to finding the key to defeat the Outsider.\n\n[Ruination](#embed:https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=1484)\n\nSoon after arriving in Ancient Libestal, Bae meets Princess Iphania, Libestal's last remaining royal. The Princess tells them of the Ruination and that the end will come after seven days. Though Bae's mission differs from Princess Iphania's own goal to defy the fate of her Kingdom, she graciously allows our heroes to take on jobs and to prepare for their respective quests.\n\n[Bae Yearns for the Mines](#embed:https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=1739)\n\nNow no longer jobless, but still poor, Bae sets out to explore the Kingdom, meeting fellow heroes, though some conversations were admittedly [questionable](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2293). Even if the dungeon is still not yet available, it does not mean that the day is wasted. Together with Tammy, Ina, and Gonathon with a G, the group explored the Library and found codes hidden within the texts of the books, including [Fia's](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2910), bringing suspicion to their benefactor.\n\nSoon after leaving the Library, Peasant The Bae meets the Hot Pink One once again, finding that the HPO is married. Whenever the Hot Pink One speaks it leaves Bae annoyed. Though she still eventually agreed to be the SC, supply chain, for HPO's consort. Throughout the rest of the day, Bae would find the Hot Pink One constantly nearby.\n\nAfter some guidance, Bae finds her way to the Job Hall to accept a quest and begin her work as a Supplier. Together with fellow Supplier Cecilia Immerkind, they left for the mines to mine lapis lazuli. Along the way they learned of their abilities to improve the quality of their tools. As they gathered materials, Cecilia and Bae bonded over their previous unemployment status and the woes of being chosen as heroes. After gathering more materials, Peasant The Bae soon learns that she would need higher quality tools and must purchase them from the shop.\n\nSoon after gathering enough materials, Bae learned that she would need coins to purchase better tools. In order to accomplish this, she set out to defeat Stains that littered the Kingdom and soon earned [more than enough.](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=7007)\n\nOnce back in the Kingdom, Bae finished her job and traded some iron ore to Shakira and received an upgrade stone. With money now in her pockets and tools enchanted well, all seems well for our beloved Bae. But alas, misfortune would soon befall her...\n\nGacha. Gacha would soon leave Bae poor once again as she attempted, and failed (even after receiving gold from Cecilia to save wisely), to obtain any of the special prizes. However, it would not keep her down as she would write in her journal that she remained true to her soul: [A Peasant.](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=8145)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"Peasant The Bae\" by Miku](https://x.com/Mikururun/status/1899107067182411936/photo/1)",

            "content": "While everyone around her was confused and panicking—grappling with the fact that they'd lost parts of their memories once more—the pink ex-tavern owner stood calmly. Why? Because she remembered everything. More importantly, she had been tasked by a certain important someone—Fia—alongside Kiara, to oversee operations at the Library. That made her feel special. She was the main character now. Probably.\n\n[I'm your hero](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=d-oTxkczcDfoDeMa&t=1009)\n\nAnd with that self-appointed title came great responsibility: explaining to the others what was happening, what to do, and how to go about it. You know, main character things. She carried herself with pride… which only made the looks she got from others more awkward—especially after she loudly introduced herself as _Mordan Ramsey_.\n\nRegardless, her new journey had to begin. Having been a cook before, it was no surprise that Calli chose to become a [chef](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=vJIwAPJzVnd5H6Yo&t=1666) again. As for the world-saving stuff—how she was one of the “Shining Stars” destined to rescue the universe? Yeah, no one really cared about that. Mordan Ramsey was here to cook, and cook she shall.\n\nShe quickly befriended her new (or were they old?) comrades, including the likes of Gonathon (see [Calli-Gonathon: My Dawg](#edge:calli-gigi)). She had a lot of “dawgs.” She formed bonds with [fellow chefs](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=3GeaCgPBFqQL-cAU&t=3179), started questing, and got used to the mechanics of the new kingdom.\n\nWith the basics out of the way, she turned to her true ambition: [opening a shop](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=Y4GcVRFhNDwNYn6w&t=4391)—again. But this time, it would be grander. Better. More delicious food. More divorce services. More charging married couples exorbitant fees. And this time… maybe even a few employees. Her last tavern was built with a green theme to reflect the Jade Sword colors, but since guilds were no longer a thing, she pivoted. Maybe bricks this time—for that solid, grounded, “no tax fraud here” look.\n\nThen came the masterstroke: a secret underground fight club basement. She called it _Dawg Pound_.\n\n[Eating a fist to the face](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=7bkRNUPKvlz0tZ7i&t=9404)\n\nA place for others to throw hands in the name of glory (and entertainment), while the soundtrack was none other than [“Lava Chicken”](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=xfsHwyAD0T8QPExJ&t=12501) sung by Koseki Bijou. Calli, of course, would be sitting pretty, raking in the profits as the crowd roared.\n\nIt was thrilling. She got straight to work laying the foundation—literally—for the Dawg Pound, pushing aside all that “save the world” and “recover your memories” stuff. Journals? Nah. Fight club first. Priorities. And in true Calli fashion, she was locked in.\n\n...And of course, just as her conviction solidified, others began to ruin her business.\n\n[Oi!!!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=_NKA4AiEGnoMhNqK&t=15668)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"see?\" by sanni](https://x.com/sanni44322/status/1921325284067811733)\n\n[\"chef mori!\" by fushide](https://x.com/fushide_/status/1919625900900896785)",

Naturally, her first instinct was to drown herself.\n\n[The intrusive thoughts](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=do0y3EhgCYkvoJ2D&t=1080)\n\n...Unsurprisingly, she failed.\n\nThis was classic Shiori: defying expectations, doing everything on her own terms—even if it meant risking the safety of the world, unsettling those around her, or earning the label of \"freak.\" Choosing a job like everyone else? No, thanks. Supplier? Too bland. Jeweler? Too bougie. Even if the ruler of the kingdom got on her knees and begged, Shiori would have happily remained unemployed. But alas, society always had a way of forcing her hand. Begrudgingly, she chose to be a chef—not because of any altruistic desire to feed the people, but because it gave her the perfect excuse to [poison](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=XKamh_0_UlRKCyzN&t=1816) them. A true hero.\n\nThus began the tale of perhaps the most dangerous chef the kingdom had ever seen. One who casually referred to a random woman as [\"Pickle,\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=5acuSuxcDzRRtjdl&t=2667) spoke freely of burying gold and breeding pigs, and generally operated in ways no one could predict. And yes—she cooked. A lot.\n\nTo everyone’s shock (and mild horror), Shiori turned out to be exceptionally good at it. She cooked up a storm and earned over 1,500 coins before anyone could blink. But for Shiori, it wasn’t enough. A new idea took root—not opening her shop (too much effort), but rather, what if she... sold her goods in _someone else’s_ shop? Or, even better, what if she bought their goods and sold them at a higher price?\n\nAnd so the Oreo Maiden’s devious schemes began. The unfortunate target? Whichever poor soul owned the establishment she decided to “borrow”.\n\n[Undercutting is crazy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=Y_mj_z_Qpgx2OJKj&t=11795)\n\nIn no time at all, Shiori transformed from a misunderstood oddball to an infamous kingdom scammer, surpassing even the speed record previously held by FaunaMart. Her notoriety spread far and wide, reaching even the ears of reclusive figures like Tam Gandr, who typically couldn’t be bothered with trivial social noise.\n\n[There, there](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=oYopwgLcQ619PkeF&t=13380)\n\nAll in all, a flawless start to her new culinary life of chaos.

Cecilia then gazes out the window and makes a vow:\n\n[Saving you and the world](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?si=V7s8jRdSb-bw9IzT&t=8520)\n\nShe returns to the job hall where the adventurers toil to accomplish their tasks when she meets Tanakisha Karia, and they learn they are cousins (see [Cecilia-Kiara: Cousins](#edge:cecilia-kiara)) and declare a rivalry to become the most kind. After a tiring day, Immerkind sets up shop next to Gonathon and visits Mordan Ramsey and Shiori of the Nyavellas at their restaurant for respite.\n\nAfter a long first day, Immerkind returns to the artist Pygmalion and marvels at the beauty of the completed piece.

Not the dying kingdom she had once vowed to save, not the universe hanging by a thread, not even the bonds she once held dear (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa](#edge:liz-nerissa)). Still, something pushed her forward. If nothing else, maybe the path ahead held fragments of who she had been: her name, her stories, and the hearts she once held close.\r\n\r\nWith no memory and no grand destiny in mind, she turned to something simpler—something grounding. The [culinary arts](https://www.youtube.com/live/XfZh_3xb7i0?si=pOseYNmId4we0h3f&t=1909). To survive the week, she took up cooking, wandering the castle grounds, helping out with the Princess’s errands, and keeping her head down.\r\n\r\nShe placed her trust in one particularly loud and passionate fellow chef—Mordan Ramsey. Despite her... colorful personality, her advice on the state of Ancient Libestal was oddly sound. So much so that she agreed to become her sous chef for the tavern she planned to open. Not bad for someone who had no idea who she really was.\r\n\r\n[I just want to cook](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/XfZh_3xb7i0?si=3600WJ1QhxxPaCmK&t=2472)\r\n\r\nIn the early days, she went around asking others what her name might be. Suggestions included [“Pickles,”](https://www.youtube.com/live/XfZh_3xb7i0?si=LsieHphNAMacw33r&t=2781) [“Mustard,”](https://www.youtube.com/live/XfZh_3xb7i0?si=Vfs5XEK6BG2ZsnzT&t=3599) and other bizarre guesses. Thankfully, Elizabeth gave her a name that stuck—**Nerissa**. A small anchor in an ocean of uncertainty.\r\n\r\nAnd so she worked. Hard. Even without memories, her instincts never left her. She cooked (mostly potato salad), gathered ingredients, bonded with other chefs, and built a modest home. She even hung a portrait of herself inside and set up a small food stall to sell her endless supply of potato salad.\r\n\r\n[Nibs and Nobs](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/XfZh_3xb7i0?si=7S0EfQQjekgE0R6Z&t=18770)\r\n\r\nIt was a confusing start, no doubt.

A cat named [Fia](#node:fia) tells her and the other heroes that they have been sent back in time to an earlier state of Libestal. The REAL Libestal, not the phony version everyone was once trapped in. While some details are clear as crystal and painful to bear, she had forgotten some details due to the effects of time travel.\n\nShe keeps her title more as a formality than a status, wishing to do good in this world to make up for what she had done before. She also remembers things about the other heroes she was once close to. While Ina remembered being her dear sister, the Hot Pink One completely forgot about Bijou and started calling her brother instead (see [Bijou-Hot Pink One: Onii-chan](#edge:irys-bijou))\n\nPrincess Bijou quickly realizes she must take up a new lifestyle, as the role of \"Princess\" is already taken at this point in time.

Through their partnership, they realize the potential of selling charms to the other heroes.\n\nOur Princess isn’t used to the commoner life. She was once spoiled by being so rich that money was no object to her. The realization of having to make her own money and soiling her hands with hard work was… a foreign concept for her. Nonetheless, she forged on, determined to build her business. [\"Princesses don't earn, they receive!\"](https://youtu.be/pEAXwijhfFY?t=6275)\n\nLate into the day, Bijou would be the only jeweler left. Several of the heroes would come to her to buy one or more charms for their own adventures, letting her rake in the cash. Between this and completing a lot of side quests, she could get used to this!\n\n...Perhaps avoid doing business underwater, though, lest you drown in the process.\n\n[Hold your breath…](#embed:https://youtu.be/pEAXwijhfFY?t=15743)\n\nThe rest of her day is spent building what will become the establishment for her charm business with Roa and the other jewelers.

However, in a perverse turn of fate, he was stripped of his memories, including those of his time in the present and of those most dear to him.\n\n[Something is missing](#embed:https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=4968)\n\nThrust into a new quest, Gonathon quickly devoted himself to his new job as a [smith](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=1679). Ever the generous and humble knight, Gonathon was perhaps [overly generous](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=9555) in giving away the valuable upgrade materials he created. Eventually, he established his smithy and began constructing a tree house next to it.\n\n[Appropriate First Customer](#embed:https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=10789)\n\nThroughout his adventures, Gonathon received many flashes of his past, which he desperately clung to [despite not understanding what they meant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT2cj934-I&t=7987s). He knew that he had lost something [precious](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=6105), and the lack of clarity frustrated him greatly. Determined to relearn what he had lost, Gonathon became committed to serving the kingdom and its people once again through his smithing.\n\n[For The Greater Good!](#embed:https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=16668)\n\nAlong the way, Gonathon bonded with many fellow adventurers, with some seeming to be very familiar. In particular, he learned [the concept of a \"dawg,\"](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=5376) a form of soul bond from Mordan Ramsey, and he quickly formed a similar bond with Cecilia Immerkind. Immerkind was quick to provide Gonathon with some words of warning, stating that he should not trust everything he hears and should make decisions for himself.\n\n[Be careful who you trust](#embed:https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=6742)\n\nThis mantra would quickly be tested, as Gonathon found himself thrust into many conflicts, in a particularly heated exchange between [Mordan Ramsey](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=13056) and [Shiori of the Nyavellas](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=12334), with both claiming to be in the right and seeking Gonathon's aid. It was here that Gonathon's truest virtues once again shone through, as he made sure to hear both sides of the story and worked with the two to reach an amicable agreement.\n\nWith the day drawing to a close, Gonathon retired to record his diary for inclusion in the Library. It was here that his self-doubt bubbled to the surface.\n\n[Their most cherished memories](#embed:https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=17880)",

She just… [forgot](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=pjoUkIMvyhTJhGRu&t=375). The Outsider? The King? None of those names registered, not even a flicker of recognition when they were brought up.\n\nBut what she _didn’t_ forget were the people she was about to meet.\n\nShe was briefed on the world's looming threat, how she and her fellow heroes were once again called upon to save everything from destruction. Most of it went in one ear and out the other. What _did_ catch her attention, though, was when Calli mentioned that everyone was expected to keep a daily journal of their journey. Writing? The Hot Pink One? Absolutely not. She hated words with a passion. So, in true Hot Pink fashion, she tried to weasel her way out of it by claiming to be illiterate. A grown woman pretending she can't read—classic.\n\n[I'm illiterate](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=Z_8Eg398E6IO1buZ&t=830)\n\nTo avoid anything that might require literacy, she chose a job that wouldn’t involve [reading or writing](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=HR2XQ6PjVgzkLghk&t=1475): chef.\n\nAnd with that, her new journey began. Almost immediately, her infamous “Hot Pink Aura” started drawing people in. Cecilia Immerkind quickly reminded her that HPO stood for “Hard Potential Oliver” and that they were the best of friends. Bijou, after a brief conversation, remembered her too—and they instantly became sworn brothers (see [Cecilia–Hot Pink One: Huh puh](#edge:cecilia-irys) and [Bijou–Hot Pink One: Onii-chan](#edge:irys-bijou)).\n\nShe then reunited with NinoIna and Peasant the Bae, reestablishing their previous connections—Consort and Peasant respectively (see [Hot Pink One–Ina: Consort, again](#edge:ina-irys)).\n\nThen came Tam Gandr—Timmy, as the Hot Pink One decided to call her (see [Tam Gandr–Hot Pink One: Timmy and Pinky](#edge:irys-kronii)). What followed was a classic bonding session covering truly meaningful topics like siblings, lack of blood relation, and... other vaguely questionable things.\n\n[I don't know anymore](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=TuCyb-7ATGOS-iDP&t=3222)\n\nEventually, after a _lot_ of distractions, she managed to gather enough materials to make a cooking pot and began her culinary career. With Nerissa’s help, she whipped up a few bowls of savory vegetable soup.\n\nShe also got wind of the Shiori Nyavella [scam saga](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=toRAAJgyNlb9mNMJ&t=12409) and decided to try selling her goods—right in front of someone else’s shop. Naturally, she was promptly kicked out. Understandably so.\n\n[How dare you kick me out!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=34ktoCQAfec2Yv2Z&t=17922)\n\nIn the end, she opened her own shop—a [pink one](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=4DWyjnCRm8GAkJ9g&t=22870), of course, to match her energy. And finally, with great reluctance, she ended the day by writing her journal. A slightly chaotic, very pink beginning to what was sure to be a memorably unhinged culinary journey.\n\n[So is she illiterate still?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=UY3BYIdiRmn1_UHr&t=24060)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"IRyS\" by Wynnie](https://x.com/WynnTerra_/status/1902017659547353299/photo/1)",

Beyond the Library shelves was the true Libestal back in the past, which harbored the genesis of the Outsider (no thanks to the birds and the bees—and some alleged fairy godmother), and The Librarian’s scattered memories paramount to unraveling the Outsider’s destiny.\r\n\r\nFia’s memory fragments, which crashed onto the land as felled stars, had become strongholds of the Ruination. Ina was to seek assistance from the court’s mages as they gradually map out safe paths to travel to those Star Sites throughout the week. That was, if she could channel her navigation skills to find the castle exit.\r\n\r\nWith the magic communications relic found on her person, Ina was mysteriously compelled to establish telepathic connection with a random peasant for a jape. While gathering intel on the first \"Star Site\" to visit on the next day, she overheared the self-introduction of a humble chivalrous knight, perhaps a comrade of days past? _NinoIna_ had placed a nametag conveniently atop her head for easy identification, much to the benefit of... her Queen? No, that can't be, this person [eats paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=2540s). A fine demonstration for that peasant, at least, for knowledge is superfood.\r\n\r\nIn a bizarre twist of fate, Ina reunited with her eternal consort, who the peasant seemed to be [cosmically at odds with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=3150s) (see: [Ina-Hot Pink One](#edge:ina-irys)). The group crossed paths with a bubbly Tam Gandr (she's low-key about it), who Ina now called \"Tammy.\"\r\n\r\nIna was eager to shirk the status of unemployed Hero and attain grand riches, embarking on a [Clean and Simple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=3917s) beeline to the Job Hall, but got lost (again) in the [dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=3976s) hallways of the castle labyrinth.\r\n\r\nShe was making good progress on her first Jewel-working task, when she became enamored by the beautiful sights of the mature untended fields next to the castle. As she uprooted and replanted the wheats and potatoes, a faraway whisper motivated her to pour her heart and soul into honoring the potato harvests. Ina vowed to make the \"potato fairy\" proud through her dedication.\r\n\r\n[Potato...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/BkJIFGhpKIY?si=TOOasp2g_o_oVHFp&t=6891)\r\n\r\nRoa cornered the currently-independent Jeweler Ina to inquire on her non-profiteering business practices. Later on, Ina was beckoned to join Roa and Bijou at the Lucky Lounge, conducting their first union meeting as Jewelers to discuss a [joint venture](https://www.youtube.com/live/BkJIFGhpKIY?si=5zYHHtJtycqaYXKe&t=10388), in a thinly-veiled attempt by Roa to monopolize the _gacha_-fied Charm market. With a preliminary agreement to sell Basic Charms at 150 Coins, the Jewelers settled on their future shop name \"Ga*charms*.\"\r\n\r\nThe cautious self-proclaimed Hero toiled the rest of the day away clearing the entire Quest board gaining many a Coin, plus experience that she could no longer take in due to the technical fatigue of battle. Regardless, she was content with completing her commitments, getting a view of the [beautiful artworks in Pygmalion's gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=12937s) and spending some of her disposable income on failed attempts to get a new hat.\r\n\r\nWith a token of [Mordan Ramsey's goodwill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=13151s) in her pocket, Ina staved herself off the enticement of gambling and retreated to the Library, where she pioneered a page on her brand-new journal documenting her path to strength. Her entry today was brief, not because of her desire to turn in early, but because she probably forgot what happened today.\r\n\r\n[MEOWMEOW](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkJIFGhpKIY&t=13685s)\r\n\r\n## Fanart\r\n\r\n[\"the hero's most powerful spell (physical)\" by kshut](https://x.com/shutowl/status/1919994120837177491)\r\n\r\n[\"HAVE A TASTE OF MY BOOK\" by The Retch](https://x.com/aFookinRetch/status/1921997300240425214)",

And the first thing she did upon seeing said cat? She called it [fat](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=HUKTRLtdetft9DSn&t=554). A flawless introduction.\n\nTam—or was she Tam? The Blue Maiden couldn't recall. Her name, her past journey, and even her former comrades were but faint echoes in her mind. Foggy, half-remembered fragments. But she didn’t seem to care. As ever, she remained completely deadpan, even amid the chaos and confusion.\n\nOthers, however, seemed to remember her. Calli was the first to call her by name—Tam Gandr—followed by Gonathon, who felt an odd sense of loyalty toward her (see [Gonathon-Tam](#edge:kronii-gigi)). And Elizabeth? Oh, there was no mistaking it—she definitely [remembered Tam](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=VPp48UAFuCMSvKch&t=2205). The moment they crossed paths again, it all came rushing back for her. With no hesitation, Elizabeth pointed her out, calling her out for who she used to be: a sassy, sharp-tongued \"fake queen\" who thrived on insulting others purely for her own amusement.\n\nEven the Hot Pink One chimed in with a nickname of her own (see [Tam-Hot Pink One: Timmy and Pinky](#edge:irys-kronii)).\n\nStrangely enough, Tam became something of a focal point. Perhaps it was the uniqueness of her name—or perhaps something else—but people seemed drawn to her.\n\n[What did you call me?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=UgoR7e-WfOs8ARgy&t=3782)\n\nAnd yet, name or no name, the Tam-ness of Tam still shone through. Her signature snark, sharp side comments, and faint air of [superiority](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=vZp0hb6TVjwCsmUK&t=3549) lingered. Once a queen, always a queen… even if no one remembered her reign.\n\nMoving on, when it came time to pick a job, Tam chose to be a supplier. The idea of gathering materials appealed to her, so she wasted no time getting started. She even managed to trade some of her early findings for a snazzy [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=GRs1MgjdHWSBgNzw&t=8470).\n\nAfter that, she began building her [abode](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=FQg3zwZiabQwSxev&t=12197) and took a little detour to investigate the widely gossiped \"scammer shop\" run by none other than Shiori Nyavella. It didn’t go well—Tam unintentionally exposed how broke she was when she couldn't afford a single thing from the shop, even with a discount.\n\n[I'll be right back](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=Vw4r0ymqmj9shtiH&t=13306)\n\nEventually, Tam settled down to write her journal entry for the Library, reflecting on the bizarre start to her journey and the strange, memorable people she had already encountered.\n\n[Tam writing her diary](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=EWtPKvo1Fk35j255&t=15167)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"Supplier fit\" by CHEL](https://x.com/chelimationz/status/1919839617232314759)\n\n[\"in the mirror\" by DoppiDonny](https://x.com/DoppiDonny/status/1921230140056424847)",

Every disaster, every loss, every soul consumed by the Stains—predicted, expected, unchangeable. It was a prophecy that had never faltered.

As stated in the Book of Prophecies, the world was doomed to fall into this calamity. Its princess, Iphania, now rules the kingdom, pleading with the heroes for their help to save the world.\r\n\r\nFia had summoned the heroes here, revealing the truths behind their previous journey—that it had taken place in a fake, fabricated version of Libestal, created as a prison to contain its false King, known as the Outsider. A being born from hatred, the Outsider, once released, unleashed its rage upon the universe. Now, the heroes—known as the Shining Stars—are asked to retrieve Fia’s missing memories, which contain vital information about the Outsider, in hopes of finding a way to prevent its existence from fully manifesting.\r\n\r\nWithin this, the Princess mentioned the name of a nameless swordsman, one they referred to as _the Outlander_—an individual on their own mission to save the world from the coming calamity.\r\n\r\n#### Uncovered Information\r\n\r\nCurrently, the heroes are gathering their resources and materials at the Remnants of the Cliffs of Sidero. These remnants are what's left of certain locations in the kingdom before the Stains and corruption spread, forcing its residents to flee and seek refuge elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Cliffs of Sidero were once the site of an ancient expedition led by an explorer who, long before the corruption took hold, ventured deep into the cliffs in search of treasure. One by one, his companions fell away, until he finally discovered what he believed to be the treasure—only to realize they had instead unleashed something terrible: possibly the Stains themselves.\r\n\r\n![Overview of the Cliffs of Sidero](/images-opt/lore-cliffs-of-sidero.webp)\r\n\r\n#### Uncovered Lore Books:\r\n\r\n**General Infomation**\r\n\r\n- [Read \"Fia\"](#text:fia)\r\n- [Read \"Libestal Ficta\"](#text:libestal-ficta)\r\n- [Read \"libestal\"](#text:libestal)\r\n- [Read \"The Outsider\"](#text:the-outsider)\r\n- [Read \"The Library\"](#text:the-library)\r\n\r\n**Ciffs of Sidero's Journals**\r\n\r\n- [Read \"Explorer's Journal #1\"](#text:explorers-journal-1)\r\n- [Read \"Explorer's Journal #2\"](#text:explorers-journal-2)\r\n- [Read \"Explorer's Journal #3\"](#text:explorers-journal-3)\r\n- [Read \"Explorer's Journal #4\"](#text:explorers-journal-4)\r\n- [Read \"Explorer's Journal #5\"](#text:explorers-journal-5)\r\n\r\n**Book of Prophecies**\r\n\r\n- [Read \"Book of Prophecies 3:21\"](#text:book-of-prophecies-3-21)\r\n- [Read \"Book of Prophecies 3:7\"](#text:book-of-prophecies-3-7)\r\n\r\n#### Updated NPCs:\r\n\r\n- See [Fia](#node:fia)\r\n- See [Iphania](#node:iphania)",

At first, she brushed it off, convinced the witch was simply jesting—messing with her, as usual. But as their conversation went on, the truth became clear. Nerissa really didn’t remember her. Not even her beloved potato salads. Elizabeth didn’t quite know how to respond to that… except by being herself. Even if Nerissa had forgotten her, the feelings remained.

She remained laser-focused on her dream of cooking for others, knowing that it would take real effort to get there. And it paid off.

With so many of her comrades having lost their memories due to the effects of time travel, even if they couldn't remember her, she at least wanted to remember them—for their sake, and her own.\n\nIn the previous journey, fragments of past adventures would surface in Elizabeth’s mind as fleeting images, but now things were clearer. To preserve the memories of her journey, her feelings, she chose to commit them to paper.\n\n[Knight's log: 0001](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=F8vVFLc7Z6fvVmx5&t=141)\n\nJade Sword, knight of honor and chivalry—those were still the principles the red-clad knight held close. Even in a new land, under a different ruler, and surrounded by those who might have forgotten her, her sense of duty, her honor, and her role as one of the \"Shining Stars\" kept her moving forward.\n\nWith that resolve, she began her new day, signing her letter as the scarlet knight she was: Elizabeth ~~Romeo~~ Rose Bloodflame (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: The Fumbler](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\nShe had two goals for the day: do her job as a smith and tackle the Star Site: Elpis Dungeon. The former came easily—she jumped straight into upgrading her weapon, which turned out to be much simpler than she’d anticipated. The latter, though, presented a different challenge—not in difficulty, but in deciding who to enter the dungeon with.\n\nFortunately, that question was soon answered. While helping Nerissa upgrade her weapon, the songstress invited her—along with Cecilia and Fuwawa—to take on the dungeon.\n\nIn the meantime, Elizabeth took on some quests—because, frankly, she was broke. During this, she shared a... let’s say _interesting_ exchange with Cecilia. Friendly? Maybe. Quirky? Definitely. The lady in green was far weirder than Elizabeth remembered (see [Elizabeth-Cecilia: Are You Okay?](#edge:cecilia-liz)).\n\nLater, the team entered the [dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=RswqYsQvMw0bMKm5&t=4650). It was packed with puzzles and demanded teamwork to succeed, but after many—_many many many_—falls, they finally triumphed over the boss and recovered IRyS’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=zwOuOP18N9MN1rsA&t=7953).\n\nAfterward, Elizabeth resumed her smithing duties. And yet, despite all the effort, she somehow remained flat-out poor. So, a bit exhausted and more than a little defeated, she turned to what any righteous knight would do in their downtime: prank people.\n\n[_I will eat your eyes_](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=uwFsQZoNgN5PsqYa&t=9848)\n\nToward the end of the day, she joined Kiara and Shiori to explore the Stronghold of Ruin, capturing cinematic shots of the [stunning scenery](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=P3mmCuJ4ecTixSHu&t=13604)—a peaceful close to a long and eventful day.\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"Evil voice\" by underdatv](https://x.com/underdatv/status/1919463544581718116)",

A hero who defended the kingdom but at the cost of creating a greater evil. New areas are now available, piquing Kiara's interest. There were more materials to gather and a new dungeon to crawl. Another chance to grow stronger.\n\nIt was harder than expected, for as Kiara's spirit as a Knight remained steadfast, her enemies were eager to match her in strength. Bijou and Roa would recommend new charms to increase her stats.\n\nKiara would then show her experience as a businesswoman as she secured [great sales](https://youtu.be/R23_uw22SK0?t=7392) for her upgrade stones. She would gain more customers and a more humble fortune as her experience as a smith grows, crafting better quality upgrade stones soon after.

The former Princess Bijou from the Gacharms Shop nearby greets Bae, and after a pleasant conversation, opens up the idea of possibly purchasing some of Bae's wares to be included in their gacha.\n\nInspired, Bae decides to set up her own—a knickknack shop to sell items she had found whilst being poor to include a double service of sorts: with every purchase, customers can get a free enhancement! With that in mind, Bae quickly used her construction box to gather mud, for it is the best-suited material for a peasant-owned shop, and acacia leaves... of which was vaguely familiar.\n\nSoon, she is astounded by the gold she now has. Perhaps a hero's life is not a bad one.\n\nShe met Nerissa, one of the chefs who opened a restaurant, and is intrigued by the food being sold. The best potato salad? Likewise, Bae advertised her shop, and hopefully, there might be [more business](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=1125) between the two in the future.\n\nBae ponders about her business—how much lapis lazuli would she need to do a full enhancement? The answer escapes her as, unfortunately, being poor left much to be desired of Bae's math skills, but fortunately, the voices in her head helped her and even suggested a fitting name for the shop: [tHE dUMPSTER!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=1764). The Peasant The Bae's tHE dUMPSTER: Where one man's trash is another's treasure!\n\nSoon after, she meets the Hot Pink One again and begins boasting of her shop that will, one day, have things to sell and with it, a free enhancement. Afterward, Bae seeks Bijou's advice about the emeralds she collected and ultimately manages to sell a stack (plus 5 extra) for 100 gold. Ina too later would be The Bae's first official customer as Bae would upgrade [~~scam~~](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=2714) Ina's pickaxe for 100 gold.\n\nWith newfound confidence and more materials gathered for The Dumpster, Bae began filling the empty lot bit by bit. To commemorate the event, she would name her beloved pickaxe and axe PP and PA, respectively, and then... buy more gacha for the [building materials, of course!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=3602). No regrets were had, clearly.\n\nBut then, Bae remembers her goal: to recover their memories. With a steady breath, she makes amends with the Hot Pink One and joins her, the Consort, and Shiori to tackle the Elpis Dungeon, where their teamwork and trust are put to the test. [Multiple times](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=6308). As the Elpis dungeon boss falls before our heroes, the Hot Pink One remembers who she was. Soon after the quest was done, they reported back to the Princess and, then Fia learned that the Outlander was indeed a hero and was investigating the Stronghold of Ruins.\n\nNow that Bae has gotten stronger, so have the Stains, and at her current level—defeat is all too common. She goes on a series of quests to improve her equipment, and at last [Bae The Peasant is now Bae The Peasant with GOLD!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=9443). But, with a price, her beloved PP axe would be mistakenly traded off. However, it was quickly replaced.\n\nAnother thing was amiss, in Bae's staying true to her peasant nature, Bae had unknowingly slighted Cecilia Immerkind. Never fear, for in the end drinks were had with celebration, the hatchet was buried, and the two made up—and perhaps, an [attraction](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=10425) was formed. Though the moment was ruined by the Hot Pink One, the two once again had heated words.\n\nAccomplished and now rich, The Bae would write down in her journals the words of Mother echoing in her thoughts and finish the day.\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"Meanwhile Peasant The Bae\" by Yume](https://x.com/Yume_ato29/status/1919498300232982554)",

Pink on all four sides, pink from top to bottom. The roof sparkled with sea lanterns, and the inside was—well, still pink, but a warm, welcoming kind of pink. The main dining area was lined with tables, with sakura petals gently falling from above and a single portrait of the owner hung for all to see. Behind it lay the basement, home to a secret fight club, and above were guest suites of varying classes: Peasant, Knight, and Libestalian King—each with a balcony view of the kingdom’s vast green fields. At this point, it was looking more like a motel than a tavern.\n\nIt was beautiful—but not finished. Miss Mordan had more ideas. She later established a [therapy stall](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=cLBaeNYSgM9NfhrZ&t=4070) right next to the tavern: 100 coins for solo sessions, 200 for couples. A chef who could cook, run a motel, and now offer therapy? What _couldn’t_ she do at this point?\n\nShe had to do it all, though—the economy was tough, and it was a battlefield for folks like her. Of course, collaboration helped, like the one she had going with [Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=-Az4QRmpYlH1g237&t=2062).\n\nTurning back to the main quest, Mordan teamed up with Kiara, Biboo, Roa, and Mococo for a mission to the [Star Site: Elpis Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=Mcd8vEwgowdvbG3w&t=6353), where they successfully recovered memories of [IRyS](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=8aHIbG2KX1DFLf3y&t=8501).\n\nToward the end of the day, she went out to gather more ingredients for cooking.

Totally normal behavior.\n\nThroughout the day, she often found herself on the sidelines, quietly observing the antics of those around her. Even when tensions ran high and arguments broke out, she’d slip in a dry remark or offbeat comment that left everyone blinking in confusion—conflict momentarily forgotten as question marks floated in the air.\n\n[The one with more money wins](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=bNv7yGbboxLsOjaf&t=5593)\n\nShe continued building up her cozy little abode, expanding bit by bit as she explored new areas with the others, which brought new discoveries, as well as [new connections](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=_mBsbkGmIb_1APIR&t=9735).

The ever-so-kind Cecilia boosts the morale of the group by giving one free compliment to her fellow travelers.\n\n[Beautiful compliments](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/48HSA_GcOZ0?si=m0OdMzJIttFapJqP)\n\nThrough adversity, they complete daunting puzzles, slay hordes of Stains, and arrive at the end of the dungeon.

During this, Irys and NinoIna gather and banter while Irys seeks to recruit Cecilia to become their \"Above SC\" (see [Cecilia-Irys](#edge:cecilia-irys)).\n\nBae finds her way into the group, and Cecilia confronts her and reconciles. This new group of Irys, Bijou, Roa, and Bae travel to the Remnants Bridge to share a drink, where new feelings start to develop (see [Bae-Cecilia](#edge:cecilia-bae)). The stress of feelings and the weight of the world were amplified by the drinks and left Immerkind emotionally vulnerable and seeking companionship.\n\nAfter sobering up with Nerissa's water and discussions with Iphania and Fia, the newly formed party of Cecilia, Shiori, and Lady Bloodflame [depart to the Stronghold Ruins](https://www.youtube.com/live/48HSA_GcOZ0?si=d7A8Eeu8Mggd-qH5&t=10381).

            "content": "Sometimes, career plans fall through, and cracks begin to form, revealing the grim outlook of the industry we've dedicated our craft to. Competition breeds cutthroat survival tactics, and it's clear that if we keep undercutting each other's prices like this, we'll never turn a profit!\r\n\r\nNerissa's cooking skills had surpassed many within Libestal, and she created nothing but impactful Gourmet cuisine from even the most simple of ingredients (potato salad, for short). She even built a charming Glowstone path to her establishment, so why was nobody coming?\r\n\r\n[First customer!](#embed:https://youtu.be/5sWjzbacGUY?t=3210s)\r\n\r\nWas becoming a chef the right choice? While other professions—like jewelers and smiths—were striking deals left and right, Nerissa was barely scraping by. Well, not really. Truthfully, she was doing quite well for herself, given the mountain of potato salad she somehow managed to churn out day after day.\r\n\r\nAt least she wasn’t alone. In the midst of attempting to crash the butter market, Nerissa came across a fellow struggling chef, and the two discussed the perils of sticking with their underdog profession. As they traded insights on the structural flaws of Libestal’s job sectors, a lightbulb went off—perhaps they didn’t need to play by the rules at all. Perhaps they could rewrite them. Thus began whispers of a potential revolution in Libestal’s food economy (a revolution that they completely forgot right after, see [Hot Pink One–Nerissa: Chef Union](#edge:irys-nerissa)).\r\n\r\nStill, such grand thoughts had to be tabled for now. Nerissa had more immediate priorities: preparing for the first dungeon—[Star Site: Elpis](https://www.youtube.com/live/5sWjzbacGUY?si=7myqyyByUtojQPIp&t=8532). Alongside Fuwawa, Immerkind, and Lady Bloodflame, the squad braved the depths and managed to recover the memories of [IRyS](https://www.youtube.com/live/5sWjzbacGUY?si=xv_Os9Yc1EXcf32c&t=11849).\r\n\r\nThen, it was back to the grind. Life as a chef might be tough, but maybe persistence would eventually pay off. At the very least, not everything felt so bleak. After the dungeon, Nerissa began recovering small fragments of her past—a past she had forgotten in the haze of her current life as a potato salad dealer.\r\n\r\n[She rember, kind of](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/5sWjzbacGUY?si=KUn5fSB0crLgmamn&t=12079)\r\n\r\nShe remembered defeating the Stain King. She remembered Mori Calliope—not just as a culinary comrade, but as the Grim Reaper herself. And most importantly—or perhaps most bizarrely—she remembered Elizabeth calling her a witch. Still, the way Elizabeth’s eyes shimmered with hope when Nerissa started to recall even vague details? That made the confusion feel worthwhile (see [Elizabeth–Nerissa](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\r\n\r\nThe memories were murky, scattered, and strange, but they were memories nonetheless.\r\n\r\nBack in the present, as more adventuring parties began to gather, her humble [Nibs and Nobs](https://youtu.be/5sWjzbacGUY?t=8240s) stall saw a modest uptick in foot traffic. Profit margins remained slim, but Nerissa wasn’t too worried about that. After all, blessings—especially those in the form of potato salad—were meant to be shared with the people you fight beside, not hoarded for coin.\r\n\r\nBesides, being situated next to the local Jewelers' stall meant she always overheard their latest hush-hush scheming. While she worked hard slicing, seasoning, and selling, others were plotting ways to [scam](https://youtu.be/5sWjzbacGUY?t=7118s).\r\n\r\nShe ended the day journaling in her journal. Not about her culinary conquests this time, but the memories she’d begun to retrieve. They brought her relief… but also a quiet, nagging conflict deep within.\r\n\r\n[Dear Lorekeeper,](#embed:https://youtu.be/5sWjzbacGUY?t=16246s)\r\n\r\n## Fanart\r\n\r\n[\"...can't go back to those happy days\" by StandingPlace12](https://x.com/StandingPlace12/status/1921472739644199167)\r\n\r\n[\"... help the business...\" by andrslmu](https://x.com/andrslmu/status/1920687085301756408)\r\n\r\n[\"Demon of Salad, take my offering\" by elskaelu](https://x.com/elskaelu/status/1918973111795359805)",

She’d devised a system to randomize which charm would be dispensed—using letters to pick a random spot on the display board inside the store.\r\n\r\nBijou was among the first to wake up today, ahead of the dungeon’s grand opening. She spent most of that time gathering crafting materials, constructing the shop’s storage area, and knocking out side quests. All for good reason—she wouldn’t be able to stay around for long.\r\n\r\nHer hard work didn’t go unnoticed. Her boss, Roa, gave her something to take on her adventures in return: a little Beast Stain hat! [“A friend?! Wait… a friend?”](https://youtu.be/03m4uWAFfQg?t=4938) Somehow, this seemed oddly familiar to Bijou. Thinking about it made her head ache… but hey, it was friend-shaped. Roa said its name was Bob.\r\n\r\nHaving given a few folks a tour of her new shop, Bijou teamed up with Roa, Mococo, Kiara, and Gordon to take on the dungeon of the day—[Star Site: Elpis](https://www.youtube.com/live/03m4uWAFfQg?si=v8NPjzKF80d-iANM&t=7792). Upon its completion, the group recovered the memories of [IRyS](https://www.youtube.com/live/03m4uWAFfQg?si=dmDDeTDMq-8PzOVB&t=9908).\r\n\r\nApparently, her brother—the hot pink one, or IRyS now—was a goddess. An alcoholic one, at that. Coincidentally, they ran into each other just after Bijou’s group had finished their conquest. And the very next day would be the gem girl's birthday! Naturally, she reminded her brother the moment she got back from the dungeon. And what did she do? [Forget](https://youtu.be/03m4uWAFfQg?t=11179). Some brother.\r\n\r\nLater, Bijou went back to stocking the shop with new items, working hard so she could ~~scam~~ make her boss proud—grinding, bartering, and doing all the things a good employee would.\r\n\r\nAs the day came to a close, she joined her brother's group by the riverside to drink, both to cool down and to celebrate the upcoming occasion. Was Bijou of age? Who knows? But she had fun, and that’s what mattered.\r\n\r\n[Cheers, and Happy Birthday!](#embed:https://youtu.be/03m4uWAFfQg?t=14062)\r\n\r\nShortly after that gathering, Bijou got so drunk she nearly drowned in the river. Then she suddenly passed out and vanished, ending her day just like that.",

It was, understandably, frustrating.

A dungeon had opened, and this one _called_ to her.

The dungeon, floating far above the world, was themed around Angels and Devils. It challenged them with puzzles that required cooperation at opposite ends. Many... _descents_ happened, testing the patience of our heroes—mostly due to the pink one’s inability to tell left from right. After navigating three puzzles, they faced the two-headed dragon: Stain King Elpis. But with the combined strength of the four, they emerged victorious.\n\nAnd then, the pink one finally remembered who she was.\n\n[One that brings Hope](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=0Hi16X4sdeWI_MnW&t=6194)\n\nShe wasn’t just a struggling chef trying to sell chocolate cakes—she was IRyS, the Nephilim born of war between Angels and Demons. With her voice, she united both factions, a being people called “a goddess”—albeit an alcoholic one.\n\nThough the revelation was profound, she didn’t change all that much. Maybe she had always been this way.\n\nTo celebrate the occasion, she joined Immerkind and the others for a drinking party by the creek, where IRyS’s commentary made many question her divine status (see [Immerkind–IRyS: Classists](#edge:cecilia-irys)).\n\nBrimming with empathy and goodwill, the pink one later lent a hand to her somewhat close friend Tammy, helping her through the same dungeon (see [Tam–IRyS: Sapphire and Lappie](#edge:irys-kronii)).\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"IRyS the savior of the food economy\" by Sub_Nil](https://x.com/SubNil4/status/1920153037156573445)",

Their journals chronicled a desperate investigation into the Book of Prophecies—and whether the Ruination it foretold was truly inevitable.\r\n\r\n![Overview of the Lykeion Campus](/images-opt/lore-lykeion-campus.webp)\r\n\r\n#### Uncovered Lore Books:\r\n\r\n**Lykeion Campus Journals**\r\n\r\n- [Read \"Researcher's Journal #1\"](#text:researchers-journal-1)\r\n- [Read \"Researcher's Journal #2\"](#text:researchers-journal-2)\r\n- [Read \"Researcher's Journal #3\"](#text:researchers-journal-3)\r\n- [Read \"Researcher's Journal #4\"](#text:researchers-journal-4)\r\n- [Read \"Researcher's Journal #5\"](#text:researchers-journal-5)\r\n\r\n**Book of Prophecies**\r\n\r\n- [Read \"Book of Prophecies 8:4\"](#text:book-of-prophecies-8-4)\r\n- [Read \"Book of Prophecies 3:14\"](#text:book-of-prophecies-3-14)\r\n\r\n#### Updated NPCs:\r\n\r\n- See [Fia](#node:fia)\r\n- See [Iphania](#node:iphania)",

It was almost comedic, the sheer consistency with which the Red Knight managed to fumble the bag. No self-respecting _Romeo_ would’ve ever acted like _that_ (see [Elizabeth](#node:liz)).\n\nIt all began when Nerissa reached out first—just a casual, friendly call from one companion to another. But what did Elizabeth say? Nothing. She was so flustered she couldn’t even form a sentence. The situation was so dire, so awkward, that Nerissa had to resort to the psychic route and communicate _directly into her mind_. That’s not romantic. That’s _tragic_.\n\n[I have a mouth and I must scream](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=OdzATm030ekRJ4KZ&t=627)\n\nThen, to make matters worse, Nerissa opened up—and shared her struggles trying to sell her homemade potato salad, clearly putting her heart on the line with this business pitch. She even offered Elizabeth a discount, a sweet gesture from a struggling chef to her friend. And Elizabeth? She couldn’t afford a single thing. Not even at a discount. [_Broke._](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=IGTI21nWiEMonaNo&t=1476)\n\nAnd just when the blue one _finally_ started to piece things together—recognizing Elizabeth from the fragments of their past—the Red Knight, in all her awkward glory, said... almost nothing. Just a few \"What do you remember?,\" and off to somewhere else she went. Girl, you were _devastated_ when you realized the bird lady had forgotten you, and now that she remembers? [_Nothing?_](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=rZrI8isM6Zm8ZSzh&t=8191)\n\nFumbling is one thing. But this was an Olympic-level performance.\n\nStill, despite it all, there was something hopeful in the air. Their chemistry, their banter—it hadn’t vanished. The spark was still there, buried under all the missed opportunities and awkward pauses. Sooner or later, they’ll get back to where they were. Probably.

Tam wrote in her journal—[six pages](https://www.youtube.com/live/k9ZejRHvNV0?si=3AKlEPdidPRmd0_z&t=9419), short and concise—about her day with the Pink One: the help she received, the quirky antics, the enchanting voice that sang “Lava Chicken,” and the bittersweet feelings she held for someone technically already married.\n\nMeanwhile, at the other end of the table... [14 pages](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=0Q2ZcIVH52OhsBcQ&t=26063).

      "dayRecap": "## Day 3: The Libestal Incest Situation Is Crazy\r\n\r\nBefore diving into the juicy chaos, let’s get the “non-important” stuff out of the way.\r\n\r\nOn the task front, the day largely revolved around two recurring themes for our heroes: grinding and material gathering. They spent time upgrading their weapons, expanding their businesses, and most notably, investigating the **Stronghold of Ruin**. It was there they encountered the mysterious, nameless swordsman—**the Outlander**—for the first time. He revealed more about his role in this tangled tale and the looming catastrophe tied to the fate of the world.\r\n\r\n![Meeting the Outlander in the Stronghold of Ruin](/images-opt/outlander-meet.webp)\r\n\r\nThat was how the day _should’ve_ gone. But now, let’s talk about the absolute fever dream that was Day 3.\r\n\r\nIf you've been paying attention, you’d notice that relationships among the heroes have always been... layered. From lovers to sworn brothers, strangers to long-lost cousins, familial themes have been running strong through the kingdom—and on the surface, that sounds wholesome. Heartwarming, even.\r\n\r\nBut no. Apparently, the idea of “family” got a little _too_ medieval for our band of “heroes.” Somewhere along the way, what began as playful speculation took a hard swerve into _full-on incest_. That's right—_Sweet Home Alabama_ levels of chaos.\r\n\r\nWe had people assuming the kingdom’s ruler and her companions were both siblings _and_ lovers. We had a cousin—yep, a cousin—making moves on a relative, and upon getting rejected, nearly spiraled into an emotional breakdown. And from the ashes of all this confusion came the crackpot theory to top all crackpot theories: _everyone_ in the kingdom was somehow related. All of them. An entire world of inbred individuals. And from this madness was born a cult. A cult of carbs. The In-Breads. Yes, a religion that believed people were bread—sandwiches even—born of divine inbreeding.\r\n\r\n![The In-breads claiming their next victim](/images-opt/inbreads.webp)\r\n\r\nSure, there were also love stories. Drama... Wolf pack? Maybe even a couple of healthy, emotionally stable conversations. But none of that mattered. It all got absolutely steamrolled by the unhinged shenanigans of the day. Up, down, left, right—wherever you looked, it was chaos.\r\n\r\nAnd the spark that might’ve lit this family-fueled dumpster fire? One orange, fiery bird lady. Who needs logic, morals, or restraint... when you’ve got _family_, right?",

Nothing grand or intense—just what she’d call a \"guerrilla\" adventure, aimed mostly at catching up on quests and general progress.\n\nRight at the start, she received a call from Shakira, who generously offered her assistance with anything she needed—being ahead of the game and all. The Red Knight appreciated the gesture (see [Kiara-Elizabeth: Sugar Phoenix](#edge:kiara-liz)).\n\nOne of her main goals today was to finally get a portrait done—she was the only one without one, and frankly, it was about time. After some back-and-forth to gather materials (missing her horse dearly in the process), she finally got her painting. And it was beautiful.\n\n[Look at that hot lady](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=xnTcW4oA0I5l5zax&t=4441)\n\nShe then moved on to gathering materials, completing side quests, and finally pulling herself out of single-digit coin status. Along the way, she crossed paths with others, even engaging in friendly duels—one of which was with the witch herself (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Strawberry Red](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\nWith her tasks wrapped up (and [pranks](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=AEpkx-sq8MxwFXQM&t=8458) delivered), the Red Knight headed to bed.

            "content": "Though things had run smoothly for Kiara the last couple of days, she found herself fretting today. Rumors of her beloved cousin's (not blood-related) marriage to Princess Iphania, charging ahead of her fellow smiths and accidentally creating a monopoly, and Mococo's lackluster sales as a jeweler troubled the knight-turned-smith's heart. This shouldn't be. Kiara resolved to support their business and buy more charms from them—and perhaps kill two birds with one stone—and gift those to Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nSteadying herself, Kiara called Cecilia to inquire about her relationships, but Cecilia did not answer. That did not stop our Knight as she headed out to look for Cecilia. Upon meeting her, Kiara would admit to her heart being ['cracked'](https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=2990) when she heard the rumors. Unable to deny her feelings for the Princess, Cecilia would offer part of her heart to Kiara's refusal, only asking Cecilia to inform her since they are family.\r\n\r\n[Sweet Home of Mother Matron](#embed:https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=5069)\r\n\r\nShe would meet Liz and gift her the charms she had bought earlier, receiving a warm thanks from the lovely Red Knight. Soon, Kiara would end up spoiling Elizabeth, giving her construction boxes that they needed for their shop along with a new pickaxe. Kiara's noble heart could not help but be moved by Elizabeth and tells her if there is anything Elizabeth needs—be it coins, equipment, or help—she will be there to support her. The two of them would bond, Kiara listening to Elizabeth missing her trusty steed and suggesting 'chicken jockey' as an alternative. They would talk about their memories and how they both remembered the past when others did not. Kiara would add that blessed be the ignorant, for knowledge is sometimes painful.\r\n\r\nKiara sees the struggles of Gonathon's hardship in the 1st dungeon and sends words of encouragement, hoping to bolster her fellow orange knight's confidence.\r\n\r\n[Shakira's Smithery's Here to Serve!](#embed:https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=10295)\r\n\r\nBusiness is blooming before and after the opening of Shakira's Smithery, selling more of her high-quality upgrade stones to Nerissa, her first official customer, and Mordan, even refunding the latter when Mordan overestimated the stones she needed. As 'dawgs,' Kiara would fondly give Mordan a discount and receive delicious delicacies in turn.\r\n\r\nThe Dawgs, now a pack of wolves with Gonathon, Mordan, and Cecilia, would take on the dungeon together. And carefully they must look it over, as Gonathon heard of clues that a treasure is also hidden in the Stronghold of Ruination. They find the fabled Outlander, seeing him trapped in the Stronghold that they will need to conquer to free him. The puzzles were tricky, but our heroes were smarter, and soon the Stain King Proto was defeated, the treasured disc procured, and the hero freed. To commemorate this momentous moment, the Pack would take a photo together. Kiara would share another [tender moment](https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=14003) in Mordan's tavern as they listened to the disc.\r\n\r\n'Twas an enjoyable moment, but a Knight's job was never finished, as Kiara would report to Princess Iphania and once again meet the Outlander by the princess' side. Kiara learns more information about the Ruination and of the distrust the Outlander has for them. She headed to the Library to report the quest's success to Fia and meet Gonathon. Unknowingly, their conversation would soon spark a great misunderstanding that would shock Libestal and _all of our heroes_ to their very core.\r\n\r\n[Heart's Woes, The Good Knight's Lies](#embed:https://youtu.be/NBU2Yp8xKLc?t=14392)\r\n\r\nGonathon would tell Kiara of his concern towards Cecilia, for he suspects the Princess and the Outlander are in love. The way they spoke seemed too tender to be platonic. Gonathon feels guilty for encouraging Cecilia. Heartbroken, Kiara would suggest that perhaps the best way is to present another option for Cecilia: Kiara and Cecilia are far, far, far cousins (not blood-related). Kiara enlisted Gonathon to wingman for her, and Kiara, in turn, promised a blind date for Gonathon and that she would watch over them to ensure a successful date.\r\n\r\nIn Kiara's journal, she would write of the satisfactions of the day. The forge is done, and Kiara and Elizabeth's relationship has blossomed, and there is still hope that perhaps she and Cecilia may one day be more than simply 'cousins.'",

            "content": "[BAE IS RICH!](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=331)\r\n\r\nMuch has progressed since we last saw Peasant The Bae, for she is now a peasant only in title, with more gold in her pockets and her beloved \"tHE dUMPSTER\" nearing its grand opening.\r\n\r\nBut, more than wealth, fortune has also smiled on Bae for the Good Knight Gonathon has bestowed upon her a [hat](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=658). In gratitude, Bae gifted Gonathon with an enchanted pickaxe, which he named after Bae herself, and procured a loyal customer in him. Perhaps a friend.\r\n\r\nBae then met Elizabeth and was astounded! Beautiful, regal. The lady exuded an aura of a queen, just like in her mother's stories. Then Elizabeth offered a spar to build up Bae's courage and strength. A spar that she won, and in doing so, impressed the Red Knight so much that she offered future lessons and the title of \"Pheasant\" to Bae. And the possibility that Peasant The Bae may become a squire—Elizabeth's. Though honored by the offer, Bae rejected it, as being a peasant is more than just monetary status. It is a title passed down by her dear Mother, [and a title Bae was proud to be born into.](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=1510)\r\n\r\nThe day goes on, but it would be incomplete without arguing with the Hot Pink One, as Bae would blatantly buy another chef's food in front of IRyS while criticizing her cooking skills. They would trade barbs to the amusement of those around them, Bijou even suggesting that the two may be fond of each other.\r\n\r\nBae would soon dive into the dungeon, meeting the famed Outlander and being tasked to help free him, which proved to be tricky since the challenges included [**Math**](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=3408). But it was no match for Bae's peasant intellect. The battles were arduous, but Bae, bolstered by the earlier spar, endured. Eventually, they would fight and win against Stain King Proto, receiving parts of Fia's _meowmery_, a treasured disc, and freeing the Outlander. Thankful, but distrusting, the hero was wary of them but nonetheless warned them of the lingering corruption within the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThey reported back to the Princess, Bae noticed a strange... sense of giddiness from Princess Iphania upon hearing of the Outlander's rescue. Methinks they are together, thought the Peasant. Perhaps the Outsider is the result of a [union between the two](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=4400).\r\n\r\nAfter a small adventure to obtain the first disc from the previous dungeon, Bae set off to mine diamonds, but as she did, she noticed the concerning amount of death text from Immerkind. Worried, Bae called her. The Kind Knight was distraught. Bae, perplexed, asked to meet and suggested that Cecilia kill livestock in order to destress while she waited. Under the bridge, Cecilia mentioned a special bond with the Princess which shocked Bae, but she was reassured when Cecilia said that it was a different 'special' from their own. Soon Cecilia would reveal:\r\n\r\n[They're... Siblings?!](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=6936)\r\n\r\nUnbelievable. Bae called Gonathon to confirm the audacious revelation and could only stagger at his answer. A knight like Gonathon had no reason to lie. Bae could not doubt the knight, rather, the pieces were falling together too well. Every Libestan they met had a similar face, akin to the Princess and the Outlander's...\r\n\r\n[The Entire Libestal Kingdom is Inbred](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=7940)\r\n\r\nIt is a different land to their own and a different norm, Bae reasoned, but unfortunately (or not) her Mother skipped this part of her education before she vanished. She had no siblings, so she could not understand. Soon, she and Cecilia told this truth to Tammy, who [heavily questioned](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=7979) its authenticity. Betrothed siblings. The news spread, Bae seeking to inform those around her and citing the trustworthy Gonathon as the source.\r\n\r\nBut the madness did not stop with Libestal. Eventually, Bae, Roa, Bijou, and IRyS would come to another conclusion: their faces looked alike. Ridiculous, but as they thought more, they couldn't deny it much longer. Bae would leave and then rejoin the group to see that a cult had formed: In-Bread.\r\n\r\n[To-mah-toh](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=9314)\r\n\r\nA cult had formed, and Bae had joined them as their Tomato and would later attempt to indoctrinate others into their group. Their goal is to become a giant sandwich. Glory to the Sandwich.\r\n\r\nShortly after the brief, but lingering, insanity, Peasant The Bae returned to her would-be shop, and after hours of work, the fruits of her labor blossomed:\r\n\r\n[tHE dUMPSTER iS oPEN fOR bUSINESS!](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=14134)\r\n\r\nWith the day almost at the end, Bae continued to do a few more quests to earn some coins and bought a few more charms to arm herself for future adventures. She would find a magnificent painting that truly honored the noble spirit of [Peasant The Bae](https://x.com/Mikururun/status/1899107067182411936) and adorn it as the finishing touch for her shop.\r\n\r\nOne last thing before she rests: with more money to spare, surely it wouldn't hurt to purchase another hat from the quest hall's shop. With a promise to earn the gold lost on the morrow, Bae bought the Stain hat and excitedly showed it to Bijou, who, upon seeing what now donned Bae's head, felt a shiver of unease. Bijou cautioned Bae to be careful and keep well. Bae, unaware of the warning, took little heed as she wrote down her day in her journal...\r\n\r\n[Glory to Sandwich](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=15371)\r\n\r\n## Fanart\r\n\r\n[\"tHE dUMPSTERRRRR\" by iennie](https://x.com/iennie_/status/1920442027751190563)\r\n\r\n[\"Join the Sandwich\" by Cellophim](https://x.com/ThatCello/status/1921233137280880850)",

There, they met with the Outlander and learned of his plight: trapped in the accursed ruin-touched prison, and the key to freeing him was to conquer the Stronghold. Understanding this, the trio [defeated the Stain King Proto](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=2575) with just a few mathematical hiccups along the way.\r\n\r\nA revelation! Roa noted that the Outlander and Princess Iphania are enamored with each other, constantly keeping the other in their thoughts. Sadly, not an ounce of trust was given to the shining heroes by the Outlander, for he did not believe. Fellow feline Fia reassured them and suggested that they could become the hero Libestal needs.\r\n\r\nThey found the Outlander and the Princess in the guest room, where the Princess urges them to work together. Roa watched the Outlander repeat his suspicions to the Princess as he left for the next ruins. Despite this unwarranted distrust, Roa could not help but coo at the lovebirds.

Love is **love**, Roa left it at that.\r\n\r\nRoa met the Hot Pink One and was fed by her [mouth-to-mouth](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=3485), to which Bijou expressed curiosity, but Roa and the Hot Pink One explained that it is something only adults do, though the conversation ultimately went nowhere since the brothers and Roa ate mouth-to-mouth-to-mouth.\r\n\r\nBijou and Roa left for their shop, and Roa was impressed by the profits made while she was away. Seeing that their inventory needed restocking, Roa took it upon herself to craft more charms, completing some more quests in the meanwhile to earn a bit more gold. The business with Peasant The Bae is also quite good, as the supplier brought back some Stain materials that Roa needed. But Bae brought more than just the goods; she brought back [a startling discovery of not just the Princess and Outlander, but of the true nature of Libestal as well](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=5595). Not surprised by the news that she already knew and unfazed by the newer revelation, Roa pointed out a key feature to support this: the Libestans all have the same face. Following Roa's keen observation, Bijou added that _they_, the heroes of Libestal from another world, have similar faces to each other, albeit differing in colors.\r\n\r\n[We Are In-Bread, Glory to The Sandwich](#embed:https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=6208)\r\n\r\nRoa is the ham in the sandwich; such a sentence may not have been spoken of before, but it is nonetheless true. Perhaps the trials of the day wore down on the businesswoman, perhaps something mysterious (sandwich) has spread over these bread-like, blocky lands. Whatever the cause, a cult was born, and their goal has never been clearer: to follow the bread and turn the entire world into one large sandwich. To accomplish this, they must bring other heroic ingredients into their fold and accept the inbreadness inside them.\r\n\r\nShifting her focus back on what truly matters: Gold, Roa knew [advertisement](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=7655) was key to ensuring that The Gacharms stayed relevant in the minds of her customers, which soon proved very effective as Bae wandered by, mentioning she received the ad, though she had skippa skippa it. Of course, it was only natural to send another one to Bae and others.\r\n\r\nAs her day drew to a close, Roa spruced up the shop's exterior, creating a much more chic design to reflect the growth of her business.\r\n\r\nA third day was finished despite the rocky start.

Her mind was a swirling enigma of oddities and brilliance, so why not put it to use? But before diving into her soon-to-be award-winning debut, she had some hero duties to knock out first. With Bijou, IRyS, and Bae by her side (strange comrades who kept talking about [shiny PPs](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=mrbHkeRHaHJ4S9E_&t=824)) Shiori helped investigate the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=zG-ew6n0Tlswdg3s&t=1239)—snarking the entire way through about the [Outlander](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=LS1xN-4KPGBFQuTx&t=2884) and the Princess, of course.\n\nThen, back to serious matters. The novel.\n\nA world of fantasy, time travel, cutthroat capitalism, and minimum wage labor—there was _so_ much material to draw from. But something was missing. The stories were too… tame. And then, divine inspiration struck: _yaoi_.\n\n[Sea x Lovers](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=O2p37u0sm5cNAVEe&t=5653)\n\nNovel complete.\n\n[Read Sea x Lovers](#text:sea-x-lovers)\n\nThe next hurdle? Marketing it. Figuring out how to make money off it. Luckily, Shiori knew just the right person to humbly request assistance from.\n\nIt had been three days since she first got to know the Orange Knight. Gullible, no doubt about that. At first, she’d only seen him as a convenient pawn—someone easily swayed, someone useful. But something had changed. Somewhere between the sly grins and half-meant jokes, between her calculated words and his sincere responses, something began to stir in her.\n\nA warmth.\n\nIt was subtle at first, just a flicker. But now, it burned just enough for even a witch like her to take notice. And maybe… just maybe, it was something she didn’t want to ignore (see [Shiori-Gonathon](#edge:gigi-shiori)).\n\nAfterward, she ended the day documenting her experiences in her journal about the new bonds she'd just made with the Humble Knight.\n\n[Documenting Gonathon](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=PSU7h0E2fe8YmwFW&t=9968)\n\nAnother page written, another memory safely archived.\n\nPen and paper—tools Shiori was intimately familiar with. After all, she was an archiver. She had admitted it openly, even boasted about the title—though what it truly meant remained unclear. Still, it hinted at something deeper, that beyond her penchant for writing questionable novels on even more questionable subjects, the witch and her ever-faithful quill held the power to write something far more important.\n\nSomething that could change her view in the others' eyes.",

Once that was done, it was time to gear up for the next big challenge: the _Stronghold of Ruin_, said to be where the elusive Outlander was holed up.\n\nHer prep began with a visit to the newly opened Gacharms shop, which—despite her initial suspicions of being a gimmicky money sink—turned out to be surprisingly fair. Plus, the excited [awooo-ing](https://youtu.be/vMdhvi8dHN4?t=4441) outside really added to the atmosphere.\n\nWith a few shiny new charms in hand, she turned her attention to upgrading her weapon.

Urged by Kiara to set her up with Cecilia (see [Gonathon-Kiara: A One-Sided Rivalry, A Two-Sided Pact](#edge:gigi-kiara)), the naive knight convinced Immerkind that the Outlander and Princess were, in fact, siblings. Whether this was a fib or what he truly believed, this rumor spiraled out of control, leading to the formation of an entire cult that Gonathon remained largely oblivious of.\n\nThe end of the day saw one of the most unexpected twists, with Gonathon falling madly in love with Shiori of the Nyavellas (see [Gonathon-Shiori: The Diamond and the Black Pearl](#edge:gigi-shiori)). While Shiori's true intentions were still uncertain, this affair served as a reprieve for the troubled knight, and as he wrote his daily journal, he mused on the future and her happiness. But could this joy truly last? And what of the fragments of memories that continue to close in all around him? Only time will tell what awaits the Humble Knight in the next few days.\n\n[Writing her daily journal](#embed:https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=20429)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[Gonathon... by Yog](https://x.com/massiveyog/status/1919634283809144908?s=46&t=Hs_QRLG_ayqKN5hO2BW3-A)\n\n[The Humble Knight's Happiness by Blaparky](https://x.com/blaparky/status/1919657314384282081)\n\n[...

But the spirit was still there. Groggy or not, the pink menace set off to knock out her daily quests.\n\nThat morning daze didn’t last long, though. A phone call from her brother snapped her back into reality: someone shady had been snooping around her shop. IRyS went to investigate, ready to confront a shadowy figure… only to be met with an unexpectedly wholesome surprise (see [IRyS-Bijou: Birthday Girl](#edge:irys-bijou)).\n\nAnd just like clockwork, the pink one's gravitational pull for the weirdest of interactions went into effect. One after another, people kept walking up to her with the strangest of conversations (see [Cecilia-IRyS: Potential Cult](#edge:cecilia-irys)). At this point, she might as well start charging consulting fees.\n\nSketchy conversations behind her, IRyS moved on to the main event of the day: the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=EFADi02eXHVT3guy&t=2633). She joined up with her brother, the Peasant, and Shiori for the dungeon run. While it wasn’t a major dungeon, it had its fair share of threats—including the cruelest challenge of all: doing [basic math](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=AekGs4GK1BLtsKjh&t=3013). Still, they made it through—though, leading up to it, everyone was strangely eager to show off their [shiny PPs](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=oN4UqMFFhl86YwaP&t=2216) (peasant pickaxes, of course).\n\nPost-dungeon, the group stuck together to retrieve a special record—IRyS’s [very own song](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=0I04ddSjUfu8ZX3v&t=6582)—from the site of her recovered memories.\n\nBack in the kingdom, while looking for more errands to run, she overheard a familiar name. Tammy? Someone else was calling _her_ Tammy Tammy? Turning to the voice, she saw _her_ Tammy—center stage, surrounded by women. The pink one wasn’t thrilled (see [IRyS-Tam: Is This Jealousy?](#edge:irys-kronii)).\n\nAnd then the day _really_ spiraled, as everyone started theorizing how they were all possibly inbred—sorry, _in-bread_. (see [Peasant the Bae](#node:bae)). Such a revelation would cause any sane person to suddenly want to, uh, _\"sandwich\"_ their little brother with their big buns.\n\n[I don't know anymore](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=qANkilpIyeBOmiVE&t=9458)\n\nA chaotic day woven into many stories, and as the day wound down, with chaos trailing behind her, IRyS wrapped up her night journaling her wild day with her brother, one bread at a time.\n\n[Journaling the bread](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=yEZ_o8DjW8P6YgUw&t=11508)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"Hot Pink Onii-chan in a nutshell\" by Hiro](https://x.com/hiroavrs/status/1919392962670452788)",

The moment she crossed paths with the Blue Maiden again, encouraging chants echoed through her mind: “Don’t fumble, Milord,” “You got this, Milord.” And she was determined to prove that she did, in fact, have this.\n\nHer strategy was simple: flatter her. Call her beautiful—no, _gorgeous_—praise the majestic feathers by her hips, and even show off a bit of her smithing expertise by crafting an upgrade stone just for her. All while staying calm, cool, and collected.\n\nAnd it was working… until Nerissa gave her a [rose](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=NRlhYHYNbLkCksuF&t=7618) in return.\n\nThat’s when the cracks began to show.\n\n[Uhh, umm... uhhh...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=1dSFxlg0GsDPjdU7&t=7799)\n\nFirst came the fluster. Then the fidgeting. Heat crawled up her face. In a desperate attempt to wrestle back control of the situation, she called Nerissa a witch—clearly hoping the accusation would distract from the butterflies wreaking havoc in her chest. But it only made things worse. “How so?” Nerissa asked. And thus began Elizabeth’s spiral.\n\n_“Aha! Witch! I have all the reasons to call you a witch!”_—was likely the train of thought. She tried to recall their past adventures, stacking up “proof” of Nerissa’s sorcery. But each memory only made her more flustered. She claimed the Blue Maiden cast spells on her. _“What spell?”_ Nerissa inquired. “You made my face a strawberry.” _“But how?”_ “You hushed my gums.” _“What does that mean?”_\n\nIt meant Elizabeth was scrambling, that’s what.\n\nDesperate to recover, they settled on a sparring match, as if a couple swings of a wooden sword could knock the embarrassment out of her.\n\nElizabeth didn’t need to hold back—she was already nerfed. Swinging her blades, raising her shield, trying to stay focused… all while a majestic blue maiden danced in front of her, fully immersed in their little spar. Every move Nerissa made was deliberate, serious, and graceful. And that sight alone? More than enough to break the composure of the Scarlet Swordswoman.\n\nIn the end, Elizabeth still won—she _was_ a knight, after all. And surprisingly, the match helped clear her head. The fog lifted. She was calm again.\n\nFor about a minute.\n\nNerissa smiled, leaned in, and kissed her cheek. A soft, simple _mwah_.\n\nA \"reward\" for the performance.\n\nThe strawberry glowed so red it might as well have been a beacon.\n\n[Ahhh, umm...

A shared secret born from late-night giggles and stolen glances, a nickname she’d racked her brain to invent, a symbol of their unique bond. That name was sacred. And now? Thrown around like a party favor for everyone to use, as if to spit on the private promise they'd once made.\n\n[Caught in 4K](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=bs7UtPAPS8H3DCok&t=6879)\n\nAnd then—_then_—as if to turn the tables, Pinkie put her lips on another woman, mouth-to-mouth. _Sensually_. Right in front of Tam. Tam couldn’t bear the confrontation and left, vanishing like a ghost with a broken heart.\n\nThey found her later—alone, still, and staring out as if the whole world had turned against her. Contemplating if it was all worth it. Thankfully, Gonathon and Nerissa were there. They talked her down, gently, firmly. Told her maybe what she saw wasn’t betrayal at all. Just a “European greeting.” Normal. Harmless. Maybe... maybe there was still hope. Maybe Pinkie hadn’t meant to hurt her.\n\n[Don't krill urself](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vMdhvi8dHN4?si=XsdfZhGLe8i6dzqu&t=12841)\n\nPinkie, meanwhile, was stewing. She wasn’t convinced. What if _Tam_ had abandoned their promise first? She had to know for sure. So she devised a plan: down an invisibility potion and spy on the Blue Maiden herself. See what truths could be uncovered. But alas—whether it was the trail of sparkles or her uncanny aura—each attempt failed. Not [once](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=vhQvTDISnORcV2gU&t=8783).

Accusations, deflections, and painful memories. “You broke our promise,” one said. “It was a three-way _feeding_ session,” the other defended. There were tales of kissing cats. Yes—_cats_. The word “hobby” was thrown like a curse. “You were a good hobby,” said Pinkie. Tammy scoffed, wounded, bringing up _Immerkind_ just to provoke some jealousy.\n\nIt was messy. Ugly. And then—_a floating cape appeared behind them_, spewing the foulest of language. A ghost? A cursed soul? Whatever it was, it scared them both witless.\n\nThey ran. Together.\n\n[Oh my god, it's cursing!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=eW5yXznvFcwXnHOy&t=11037)\n\nAnd somehow, through the shared panic, they found something they’d lost—_understanding_. Maybe it was ridiculous. Maybe it was fate. But when they stopped running, so did the anger. They looked at each other; tears welled, and suddenly it all made sense again.\n\nThey forgave. They embraced. And just like that, Pinkie and Tam were whole again.",

My Princess?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icdii90_vSA&t=5012s)\n\nGonathon, ever the loyal friend, did all he could to anchor her, to soften the blow, to joke, distract, or rationalize—anything to keep her from spiraling. But nothing could dull the ache in Cecilia’s heart. Her confession had been met not with rejection, but with silence. Silence, and a distant gaze meant for someone else.\n\nTears brimmed and spilled before she even realized they had formed. She turned and fled, seeking solace in the quiet corners of the castle, eventually collapsing into the familiar comfort of the princess’s chambers. A place that once felt sacred now felt cold.\n\nMaybe… maybe the princess hadn’t spoken because she was overwhelmed. Confused. Yes, confuzzled. She’d just reunited with the Outlander after all this time—it made sense, right?\n\nBut Cecilia, in her pain, latched onto a singular, destructive conclusion: _if the Outlander was the burden, then removing them would set the princess free._\n\n[For ~~Justice~~ Love!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?t=5430s)\n\nHer thoughts spiraled, her heartbreak twisting into resolve—but thankfully, Gonathon was still there. He yanked her back from the brink, firm and unwavering. “No,” he said. Not like this.\n\nStill, Cecilia’s heart had not surrendered. She wasn’t ready to give up—her feelings burned too brightly. And even if they hurt, even if they were ignored, she swore they would be heard. One day, her love would reach the princess.\n\nIt was only a matter of time.",

A fate where, each time the Outlander saves the world, he ends up dooming it—birthing the very calamity he sought to prevent, the Outsider.\n\nThe Princess pondered stepping aside, letting the heroes take on the mantle instead. Maybe a different path would lead to a different outcome. But the Outlander, wary and weathered, remained skeptical. If the heroes truly wished to rewrite destiny, they'd need to prove it—not with words, but with action.\n\nAnd so, the Princess gave them their next task: to investigate the next Star Site. Perhaps, within it, lay the answers they were all searching for.\n\n[What comes next?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/uX0rZYSrb4Q?si=UABlcxchRxHiGh_d&t=7144)",

At this point, that’s just tradition. Day Four delivered two things: a time lord and a Korean soap opera. Two wildly different beasts—yet somehow, both showed up to the same dinner party.\r\n\r\nEarly in the day, our heroes zeroed in on the main objective: investigating the second major dungeon, the **Star Site: Chronos**. Here, time reigned supreme—each challenge shackled by ticking timers, counting down as the adventurers scrambled for answers. The theme wasn’t just surface-level either. This dungeon was deeply tied to the memories of a key figure. One that many thought was just a broke, self-declared queen—only to discover she was, in fact, the _Warden of Time_ herself.\r\n\r\nAlongside that came a game-changing revelation about the mystery of the Outlander, flipping the narrative on its head and solidifying the heroes' purpose: save the world.\r\n\r\n![Our heroes against the Stain King: Chronos](/images-opt/chronos.webp)\r\n\r\nBut let’s be real.\r\n\r\nNo one cared about such a frivolous responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe second law of thermodynamics says that entropy only increases—and if you’ve been following this story, you’d know that law hasn’t missed a single day. Things have only gotten messier since day one.\r\n\r\nGonathon with a G—a knight known for his humility, his generosity, his unwavering care—somehow managed to steal Elizabeth’s crown for the biggest fumble of the season. His performance in today’s love drama was so generational, so chaotic, that comparisons were made. To what? _\"A goat being washed.\"_ That's how bad it got.\r\n\r\nThe knight in orange cooked up a love story so convoluted that most around him either gave up entirely or begged not to be involved. Those unlucky enough to be roped in—yes, even the queen he once served loyally—became collateral damage. Gonathon G? More like _onathon_, because no **G**irls would dare take this person's hands.\r\n\r\n![Moments before the \"goat\" fell off](/images-opt/goat.webp)\r\n\r\nYet, in the eye of the storm, peace still existed.\r\n\r\nElizabeth spent quiet time in her forge, chatting with the voices in her head. Nerissa kept grinding, forever in pursuit of her beloved potato salad. And right in the middle of all the chaos, tucked humbly into the heart of the build zone, there stood a cozy little cafe. A cafe that didn’t chase profit but offered delicious food, handmade with love and fluff. Waiting. Always waiting. Not for gold or fame—but just to make someone smile.",

The objective hadn’t changed: gather resources for building, materials for cooking, and, if possible, find at least one person to accompany her. Because without her usual fuzzy companion by her side, this journey had felt... somber.\n\nAnd as if the world heard her silent plea, a small, feathery friend arrived.\n\n[Hello there, little one!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=Go2F6QDRR0qDVuZC&t=1177)\n\nA chicken. An animal that Fuwawa held close to her heart. Her previous journey had revolved almost entirely around tending to flocks, nurturing and loving them as family. To have that feeling return—however small—was like a gentle breeze to a tired soul.\n\nThe chicken was mischievous, tiny, and always [darting around](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=2wRpax8PI0MsZJg6&t=1331) at the first chance it got. Fuwawa had to think of countless ways to keep him from escaping. But once he was secured within the cozy café, she named him _Moco-chan_, a quiet homage to the companion she missed dearly.\n\nFeeling a little more grounded, Fuwawa turned her sights to progress. She reached out to others for help in catching up with the dungeons. First came the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=J38XCoSl-nVt5AHh&t=1863). Then, she joined Shiori, Mococo, and Bae in the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=AMeAFfmmilO48tEp&t=4763). Together, they recovered the memories of [Ouro Kronii](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=2vIMbyUxKOHbQ2y5&t=8554).\n\nThen it was back to work on her café. Materials were still needed, and thankfully, [Shakira](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=a98N053xbj--51z9&t=3509) offered stones to help with construction. Things were looking up. The little owner had [no sales](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=2WqV9LXEoUfycxxp&t=3849) yet, but she was hopeful. Her dream still shimmered in the distance—and for once, she wasn’t alone. Moco-chan was with her.\n\n[Moco-chan~](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=MON2jav5merqyE4a&t=3907)\n\nAt least, for a short time.\n\n[Moco...chan?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=qZPau0VzbYTi2o2i&t=9171)\n\nFuwawa stepped out for errands, and when she returned... Moco-chan was gone.\n\nShe ran. Panicked. Calling out. Searching every corner of the area. But there was no sign of him. Had he wandered too far? Was he okay? Would he come back?\n\nShe told herself not to blame him. She could never. If he didn’t want to stay, she wouldn't force him. Fuwawa only ever wanted the best for others. That’s who she was. But pretending it didn’t hurt? That would be a lie.\n\nShe ended the day as always—writing in her journal. But this entry weighed heavier than the rest.\n\nHer shop stood open, but no one had come to buy anything. Visitors were rare. And when they _did_ stop by, it was to ask for something... or to advertise. Not to sit. Not to chat. Not to stay.\n\nHer dream was starting to flicker. The other chefs were so talented. So successful. Could she ever catch up?\n\nThe café was empty. And Fuwawa sat in that emptiness.\n\n[Bau bau...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=LCtvw4QaRwM0kijj&t=11917)\n\nBut even in a space like that... there was still hope (see [Shakira-Fuwawa](#edge:kiara-fuwawa)).\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"Libestal's Young Chef (Part 1)\" by Dreamplanes](https://x.com/Dreamplanes256/status/1921562462647709819)",

The investigation of the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=mlKGQ7NhgMZ73vBu&t=1871) was still a blank in her itinerary, so she called in reinforcements. With the help of Immerkind, Bijou, Gonathon, and Ina, she powered through and got herself up to speed with the rest of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nWhile waddling about afterwards, she happened upon a _very_ public therapy session between Mordan and Gonathon.

It was a web of drama spiraling out of control, and she was at a loss on what to do.\r\n\r\nEnter Mococo: therapist extraordinaire.

And of course, in the midst of all the day’s events, her moments with Nerissa stood out—moments she hoped to see more of today (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Frame By Frame](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\n[Log 0002](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=miuGcqt46LMF_GCh&t=95)\n\nHer morning began much like the previous one, with her ever-dependable sugar phoenix once again offering assistance for a major task: investigating the Stronghold of Ruin. Before setting off, Elizabeth took a brief tour around the kingdom, admiring the creations people had built—and couldn’t help but feel a strange déjà vu seeing enormous [floating text](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=gbwqdZGPxPB_RjoQ&t=651) in the sky again.\n\nThe dungeon itself was conquered, and with the mission complete, she moved on to gathering materials. During a brief lull, Elizabeth checked in with [Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=ZHTbaG0Zv_dYDNx4&t=5606), who had tried to contact her earlier. What followed was a friendly—if somewhat bizarre—back-and-forth full of playful jabs, as the two debated their way of addressing each other: one being a knight and the other being a witch.\n\nShiori also took the opportunity to promote her growing business, selling \"memories\"—detailed records of each day’s journey. Elizabeth, intrigued, bought a few and read through them, raising a suspicious brow with each entry.\n\n[Her writing is this fire?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=a1GZJG59uOdXfzBc&t=11809)\n\n[Read \"Chicken\"](#text:chicken)\n\n[Read \"Pickles\"](#text:pickles)\n\n[Read \"Gyatt\"](#text:gyatt)\n\nAs the day continued, Elizabeth focused on improving her forge, even constructing a hidden underground bunker to safely store her goods. Of course, she had a secondary motive too: a perfect place to [prank people](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=ewOxwttSz3l0BUTO&t=22074) without being caught.\n\nShe wrapped up the first half of her day on a warm, wholesome note—spending quiet, meaningful time with Nerissa, as their bond continued to deepen.\n\n---\n\n**Part 2**\n\nTired and slightly sleepy, Elizabeth still did her best to keep up with her journal. Thoughts wandered to her Jade Forge, to her old animal companions from journeys past—silly memories, sure, but they made her heart ache in a warm, nostalgic way.\n\nBut just as she wrapped up her writing, a sudden flash of thought pierced through her mind. Ominous. Unsettling. A message that lingered longer than it should have.\n\n[\"Are they with you or against you?\"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/1tE2N1kP2YA?si=IEaSGDXxGSpZj8xf&t=198)\n\nNow then, Elizabeth was _literally alone_ in the kingdom at the time.

She worried that two knights would not be enough but, despite the difficulty, they prevailed.\r\n\r\nIt was an interesting day as well, from the howls just outside [Mordan Ramsey's Tavern](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=653) to a newly built house whose design left Kiara [giggling](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=782). The Lorekeeper remembered previous constructs Ina had built once before, though Ina pouted at Kiara's reaction; t'was nothing more than a jest between friends. Kiara marveled at her own forge's design, appreciating the little touches Elizabeth had improved, particularly the [Shrine of Love](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=1038). Has Elizabeth's and Nerissa's relationship improved while Kiara was gone?\r\n\r\nKiara's own relationship with her questionably related cousin was lacking. Though she expressed fondness for Cecilia's new hat, worry emerged as they talked about Cecilia's plight, a worry that only grew when Kiara learned of her cousin's [alcohol problem](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=1665). and her taking out a loan from the Peasant The Bae. The thought of winning Cecilia's heart seemed only to grow more grueling. Gonathon revealed Cecilia's aversion to cousin romances, and that Bae had a _special_ interest in the Kind Knight. Nonetheless, it was a challenge, and Kiara would rise to meet it.\r\n\r\nBut there is another duty Kiara must rise to: the Chronos Dungeon, where their grasp of timing was put to the test. Conquering through their confusion, they soon defeated Stain King Chronos and found another treasured disc in the meanwhile. Soon another memory unfolds before them: Tammy's.\r\n\r\nA Queen Tammy was, and regal she still is; Kiara couldn't help but admire her. But there are more important matters: The Blind Date. The promise to Gonathon felt heavy on Kiara's shoulders, but she would ensure it would reach a lovely conclusion.\r\n\r\nAh, the Knight was so consumed by the date that she forgot to report matters to the Princess! But before Kiara could finish her report, Shiori interrupted with a small concern. She spoke of the blind date between Gonathon and Mordan... but Shiori was interested in Gonathon. It seems matters are [complicated](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8573).\r\n\r\n[Turmoil stirred in Kiara's noble heart.](#embed:https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8832)\r\n\r\nConfounded. Concerned. Fear of ruining an already blossoming love. Kiara called Mococo for therapy, but the advice 'follow your heart' was too simple for a complicated matter that Kiara inadvertently created. How could she follow her heart when its path is unclear? Especially when Mordan was [ready for the date](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=9226). This is the best day of my life, Mordan exclaimed, to Kiara's growing horror.\r\n\r\nAs the date began, Kiara invited Shiori to watch the blind date with her, in case the love between the Humble Knight and Therapist was not meant to be. Was it a bright idea to invite Shiori, who was interested in Gonathon, to the event? The short answer is 'no.' The longer answer: Shiori would dramatically pretend to drown, interrupting the date, which would lead _Mordan_ to dive in to save her. [It got more complicated](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=9745). The Good Knight is too popular for his own good.\r\n\r\nKiara fretted as everything fell apart. Mordan proposed to Gonathon. Shiori rescued Gonathon from the dreaded **berry bush**. The silence from Gonathon was astounding as he cried to Tammy about [his woes](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10281) while Shiori and Mordan had a [simple non-blind date](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10111), though no spark could be had between them.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Gonathon seemed to have made his [choice](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10733). For a moment, all is right. A ring was given to Shiori. Then, without a shred of awareness and with the naivete the size of Kronii's ego, [Gonathon took the trophy and threw it on the ground](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10733). Whatever happened next, Kiara did not witness.\r\n\r\nEven Princess Iphania wasn't spared, as the revelation of _the Outsider_ and _the Outlander_ broke her heart. The hero she fancied would be punished by the gods. Truly, a terrible day for love.\r\n\r\nBut still, Kiara went through her day. Exploring the new area and soon acquiring a diamond pickaxe, which was soon upgraded by Cecilia. She would be selling the new legendary upgrade stones at a [very affordable price](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=13082) and trading a few for Bijou's legendary charms.\r\n\r\nKiara couldn't help but pour her heart out to the Gacharm's friendly ear—[accidentally, within hearing range of the couple in question](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14507). Though they didn't hear Kiara's woes, Kiara couldn't help but follow the couple. Mesmerized by the flames of shattering love, Kiara watched it all [unfold](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14970).\r\n\r\nHeart-wrenched and guilty that her own hand, by which Kiara swore to defend others, had no small part in creating the drama that ultimately ended in Gonathon's broken heart, Kiara burned herself at the campfire and turned into a ghostly phoenix. It was an agonizing day. Her own failed endeavors towards her kind cousin, the fumbled date between Gonathon and Mordan, and Shiori and Gonathon's break-up. Perhaps Kiara's love was to be an appreciation for life.\r\n\r\nAll this she wrote in her journal. But, even if her goals were not met, it doesn't mean that others should suffer an equally miserable day. She paid her dues to Mococo, expressed to Shiori how Kiara had misunderstood her at first and now sees the kindness in her, and [bought a significant amount of food from Fuwawa's shop](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=18238).

            "content": "It was another brilliant morning for Peasant The Bae, a peasant with a whopping 13K gold. But, as she went around showing off her new hat, the others looked at it warily, [inquiring how Bae felt](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=428) to her bemusement.\n\n[Peasant Partner Loan (PP)](#embed:https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=1188)\n\nBae knew what it felt like to be poor, penniless, and destitute. But now that she was overwhelmingly wealthy (for a peasant), she could now help others much poorer than herself. With this in mind, Peasant Partner Loans was created for those in need of petty cash. Of course, nothing in life is free, and an interest rate of 150%—subject to change—was only fair.\n\nThose who don't pay back? Well, Bae can be persistent. Persistence was shown as Bae took a page from Roa's business book and sent out advertisements of her own, each ad tailored uniquely for a certain prospective customers. Except for one. Cecilia Immerkind would get a special courtesy call from Bae and a reduced interest rate of 100%... success! PP Loans would have its first debtor in the Kind Knight. And its first detractor was the [Hot Pink One, who accused Bae of running a scam](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=3711), which Bae denied. She was running a legitimate business!\n\nBae's health and morality were, once again, questioned by Bijou and others. They asked her a simple question: A wagon was traveling down a trail but was soon caught between a forked road. On one road lay a baby who would only live until 5, and the other road had 5 elderly people, each having 1 year left to live. The child or the elderly, who would Bae choose to condemn?\n\nThey fretted as Bae pondered her answer but calmed when she said, \"I would stop the wagon.\" But when pushed to choose, Bae ultimately decided to condemn the _baby_, for [they have to kill a baby anyways](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=4026). As she answered, Bae entered a strange trance but seemed to return to normal.\n\nIgnorant of her friends' troubled expressions, Bae turned her attention to the day's current challenge: The Chronos Dungeon. Time. Rewind. Pause. The machinations of the dungeon would confuse our heroes as they made their way through. At last, only Stain King Chronos stood in their way. Like the challenges of the dungeon itself, Time was in his grasp, but it was not enough. Soon another memory, Tammy's, would be unveiled.\n\n[Tammy was a queen!](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=8275) And a Time Warden, but that was unimportant. Bae was astounded that she was in the presence of royalty all this time! But Bae worried—would her memories be up to par? In a rare moment of comradery, IRyS echoed this sentiment; she was drunk in memories! Unsightly compared to the Warden's regal aura.\n\nTammy comforted them and reaffirmed that the Hot Pink One is a goddess no matter what. While it seemed that Tammy was still her same kind self... until the Queen called them _plebeians_. Bae may be a peasant but that is an honorable title! She got it from her mother, who got it from her mother, who got it from her mother.\n\nAs Bae reported the dungeon's events, she learned only heavier news: the kingdom was still on track for ruination, and the Outsider was the heroic Outlander. But, despite the series of unfortunate events, a silver lining was found: diamonds. Bae found her skills as a supplier only grew, and the culmination of her hard work draws near...\n\n[PICK OF POWER (PP)](#embed:https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=11740)\n\nA diamond pickaxe maxed out to its true potential. A new Axe of Power (AP) would soon be created to match her PP. Bae's mother would be proud. And just like how she bears the Peasant title proudly, Bae will never forget her roots, framing the older iron pickaxe and axe on the walls of her shop. Business was booming as Bae forged Ina a new diamond pickaxe and sold Bijou a handsome stack of enigmatic stones.\n\nCecilia would successfully pay back her loan at the end of the day. But not all customers would be sold, as Queen Tam refused Bae's services, and a strange moment occurred when [Tammy yelled at the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=12995), who promptly ran away.\n\nJust as Bae was about to go to bed—staying up late was something Mother would have disapproved of—she quickly realized that there were a few chores left to be done. She quickly called Bijou to gacha a few charms, luckily winning her gambles, and would go to buy a legendary upgrade stone from Gonathon to witness the [Good Knight's Marital Troubles](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=14642).\n\nAstounded, shocked, and confused, Bae wasn't sure what to do, but the time was ticking, and she was already past her bedtime. She interrupted the drama to quickly finish the trade with Gonathon and sleep for the day, unaware of how the Knight's night would end.",

The ever-delicate, always-messy realm of love—specifically, the brand of love that involved siblings, mutual friends, and being roped into playing the role of wingman whether you wanted to or not.\n\nOf course, that wouldn’t be the last therapy session of the day. In fact, love became the centerpiece of nearly every conversation the two had throughout the rest of the date. Mordan, ever the \"professional\"—at least in theory, claimed she was simply offering her services—nothing more. Surely, she'd never get caught up in the tangled mess her clients kept dragging into these sessions… right?\n\n[Therapy session of questionable topics](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=4AnsPPNT_wg8l5Ml&t=215)\n\nLater, she joined Tam, Nerissa, and Gonathon for the day’s main mission—investigating the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=lAhFFA_4EjWnc_FJ&t=4562).

A rival had appeared. No experience. No credentials. But with prices so low, it hurt.\n\n[She doesn't have a license](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=jllaYw_Lnzhq52cC&t=3403)\n\nBut the real twist came when the very storylines she swore to avoid started dragging her in. Remember all that messy romantic drama Gonathon kept rambling about in therapy? Yeah, Mordan suddenly found herself cast as the “destined love” in a blind date stunt cooked up by her own client—resulting in complete chaos for Gonathon’s actual crush (see [Calli-Gonathon: A Powerful Dynamic](#edge:calli-gigi)).\n\nAnd what did Mordan do after throwing the whole table into the air?\n\nShe just... left.

She had been eyeing one humble knight ever since their first encounter during a past journey, and it seemed those feelings were starting to solidify. Despite her original intentions—manipulating him for her own gain—things had changed. Somewhere along the way, she might’ve actually fallen for him.\r\n\r\nSo naturally, she started her day by infiltrating a therapy session and eavesdropping on her crush.\r\n\r\nGotta show you care, right?\r\n\r\n[Sneak 100](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=kxtX6JlJhKG0uDhE&t=668)\r\n\r\nOutside of all that, Shiori had a proper mission today like everyone else: to investigate the [Star Site: Chronos dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=lhZpQ8N-1lD_eYDy&t=2014). Teaming up with Bae, Fuwawa, and Mococo, the group overcame the conquest and recovered long-lost memories of [Ouro Kronii](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=IaJKKnb-D4y6qJfY&t=5814).\r\n\r\nAnd right as she stepped out of the dungeon, Gonathon—who was on a different team—emerged around the same time. Shiori, seizing the moment, dragged him off for a little one-on-one time.\r\n\r\n[Just the two of us](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=d0aIf-aCyYQrcc5X&t=5985)\r\n\r\nHe was kind, honest, and pure—everything she admired. And she knew that if she didn’t make a move soon, her chance might slip away. So, upon learning that Shakira had arranged a [blind date](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=I8E4D1s69cbSEPwP&t=6398) for Gonathon, she approached the phoenix and, in her classic tsundere manner, asked to take the mystery slot.\r\n\r\nBut that seat was already filled. Due to a major misunderstanding, Shakira had placed Mordan in the date slot, believing she had feelings for Gonathon.\r\n\r\nStill, Shiori wasn’t one to give up so easily. She had a plan: crash the date and steal Gonathon’s heart.\r\n\r\n[Ahhh! I'm drowning!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=G-v3Mv7AulkgIwP3&t=7526)\r\n\r\nBut things didn’t go how she’d hoped. Even after laying her heart bare, it all unraveled quickly (see [Shiori-Gonathon: The Witch’s Trials](#edge:gigi-shiori)).\r\n\r\nThen, as if fate herself had taken pity on the heartbroken Maiden, an old acquaintance—someone once dear—approached to help ease the pain. The two shared a long, heartfelt conversation, reflecting on the bond they once shared (see [Shiori-Bijou: Severed, but still there](#edge:shiori-bijou)).\r\n\r\nShiori closed out her day by journaling everything: her hopes, her heartbreak, and her thoughts on what might lie ahead.\r\n\r\n[Hurtful, but still hopeful](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=hY1jLc2nVd9MTUO6&t=14316)",

These included arranging service negotiations with [Immerkind](https://youtu.be/zVWvu3ozXKM?t=2258s), ignoring spam mail like a responsible adult, restocking her humble shop (with a side of battle rations), and, most importantly—finding the perfect spot to hang her portrait. Not in her own home, no, but somewhere far more meaningful. Someone else's place. Someone special (see [Elizabeth–Nerissa](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\nWith all that done, it was time to prepare for the dungeon ahead. That meant food. That meant materials.

This would last for several minutes.\n\nThis was the least of her troubles today. Far from it. In fact, the little princess was intertwined with a lot of the day’s drama. She even reconnected with a few people along the way.\n\nNinoIna returned after being absent the day before. Blissfully unaware of what happened yesterday, she tried roping her sister to become one with the potato. Bijou agreed but, in turn, tried to get her to become one with the bread… to no avail. Bijou would stay in-bread though!

Is the Corruption at risk of spreading here too? She felt the need to speak with someone about this. Having discussed this matter with Gonathon earlier, she immediately called him up. She discovered that he was in the middle of a therapy session with Mordan Ramsey; she didn’t care, so she butted in like a kid getting an adult’s attention.\n\nMordan offered to give her two cents, but only after Bijou paid 100 coins (which she agreed upon as long as she got a snack from her—again, very childlike). The reaper suggests they try tricking the Peasant into giving up that cursed hat somehow in a trade. If that doesn’t work, Mordan would gladly take her into The Basement to forcibly take it off.\n\nSpeaking of The Basement, Bijou wanted to finally see it for herself as part of her therapy. She would NEARLY get inducted into The Wolf Pack… if only she wasn’t an in-bread. Regardless, Gonathon agreed to fight the corruption alongside her, should the need arise.\n\n[Couples’ Therapy with Gonathon](#embed:https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=4396)\n\nShe would later join IRyS, Immerkind, Kiara, and Ina to investigate the day’s dungeon, Star Site: Chronos. It was there where they would recover the memories of Tam Gandr, or Ouro Kronii. With her memories restored, everyone returned from the dungeon worshipping her. In the midst of it all, Princess Bijou blurted, “Does that make you my mom?” (See [Bijou-Kronii: Not Again...](#edge:bijou-kronii))\n\nBack at Gacharms, Kiara would visit to fulfill their trade relationship, patiently waiting in line for Bae to finish her pulls. She would end up [spilling tea](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=18313) to Bijou about a blind date he put Gonathon and Mordan on. It fell apart after she realized at the last moment that Gonathon had fallen for Shiori instead, who _appeared during said date…_ causing a chain reaction.\n\nThey suddenly started hearing voices above them… It was Gonathon and Shiori on the roof. Unbeknownst to Kiara and Bijou, there was _already_ an update to Kiara’s gossip that had transpired during her entire talk. The interaction that ensued on the roof set off a chain reaction caused by a misunderstanding, and eventually… a divorce (see [Gigi-Shiori: The Witch’s Trials](#edge:gigi-shiori)).\n\nSeveral people watched the breakup happen before their eyes, behind the glass windows of Shiori’s house. Bijou couldn’t help feeling sad seeing Shiori cry, so she came to her side soon after. She took this opportunity to reconcile with her past and get back with Shiori. She wanted to mend Shiori’s twice-broken heart. She also felt bad about abandoning their child, Khaos, and vowed to bring him back (see [Bijou-Shiori: Severed, but still there](#edge:shiori-bijou)).\n\nNow Bijou has double the motivation for what she vented about to Mordan and Gonathon. There was a moral need to get the Peasant to give up that Stain hat. This would ultimately be for everyone’s sake… but especially her own, to fix her relationship with Shiori. It was not just a (cursed) hat; it was her child. Their child. How she’ll do it… is a problem for another time.\n\nShe spent the rest of the day gathering materials, all the while pondering if she should confess to Gonathon her feelings towards Shiori. He had forgotten all about their previous adventure in the illusory version of Libestal. She figured that she didn’t want Gonathon to feel bad about taking her girl, so she had to say _something_ about it.\n\nThey both agreed to meet back at Gacharm, and it’s there that Bijou confessed about her rekindled love for Shiori. The entire truth came out, and Gonathon seemed to be understanding, despite looking troubled and pacing around in place.\n\n[“...We were, in fact, betrothed.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=21191)",

            "content": "**The Humble Fumbler**\n\nAs the sun rose on day four, no one could foresee the maelstrom of turmoil and tragedy that would engulf Gonathon and those closest to him. The day began simply enough, with the Humble Knight visiting Gacharms to acquire new equipment. Chief on Gonathon’s mind was the suspected corruption of Peasant the Bae, which soon extended to Princess Bijou upon learning of her past corruption (see [Bijou-Gonathon: A Rock and a Hard Place](#edge:gigi-bijou)). These concerns had to be set aside, as an encounter with Immerkind led to Gonathon becoming once again conflicted with the [role](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=21m13s) he had played in Immerkind’s delusional pursuit of the Princess. (See [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Kind and the Humble Knight](#edge:cecilia-gigi))\n\nHis search for solace led him to Mordan Ramsey, who, after some haggling, agreed to become Gonathon’s therapist (see [Mordan-Gonathon: A Powerful Dynamic](#edge:calli-gigi)). It was during their discussions that Mordan revealed that not only was the [Pearl](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=1h23m45s) someone very close to Gonathon but was, in fact, his former lover who had since disappeared.\n\n[I was called… a diamond…](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h17m53s)\n\nGonathon had little time to ponder these revelations, as he joined Tam Gandr, Nerissa, and Mordan in tackling the next dungeon, [Star Site: Chronos](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=1h44m14s). The puzzles and boss proved to be a formidable challenge, but they paled in comparison to what came next. Upon the Stain King’s fall, a flood of memories returned to Gonathon: Tam Gandr was the Queen of the previous Libestal and a powerful Time Warden. Returning to Libestal, Tam and Gonathon shared a heartfelt reunion, with both affirming their ironclad bond and Gonathon pledging to stand by Tam no matter what (see [Gonathon-Kronii: The Queen’s Gambit](#edge:kronii-gigi)).\n\n[You will always be my queen!](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=2h43m48s)\n\nFrom here things took a turn for the dramatic, with Shiori of the Nyavellas at the center of it all (see [Gonathon-Shiori: Trials of the Witch](#edge:gigi-shiori)). While Gonathon and Shiori's newfound love was still just beginning to blossom, this love would be stretched all the way to the breaking point.\n\nThe destined blind date set up by Shakira finally occurred, with [Gonathon’s date being none other than Mordan Ramsey!](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h11m48s) Things only got worse as Shiori, seeking to observe the date, began to drown and had to be saved by Mordan. As the two rivals for Gonathon’s affection started to quarrel, the hapless knight couldn’t take the pressure and fled.\n\nIt was here that Gonathon’s lack of decisiveness and blind loyalty reared its ugly head, as the knight begged for Tam Gandr to not only provide advice but also to [directly observe and live](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h28m55s) with him and Shiori as a way of preventing any misdeeds on his part.\n\nWhile Tam agreed to assist, all of this was too much for Shiori. She decided to test Gonathon to prove his devotion and eventually formed a soul pact with him, and they briefly became husband and wife. A meeting with Immerkind led to some more [words of wisdom](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h23m50s) from the green wolf: that even if Gonathon’s memories were not the same as they were in the past, deep down Gonathon was still the same person. The two wolves vowed to escape this timeline together, their bond stronger than ever.\n\n[Love is when you spend time together!](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h19m42s)\n\nAlas, none of this was enough to overcome Gonathon’s crippling dedication to his queen and inability to make his own decisions. Upon returning home, Gonathon encountered what seemed to be a startling scene: [Tam Gandr and Shiori engaging in an affair!](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h31m02s) But rather than seek answers from the two, the bumbling knight chose to once again flee, an act that, along with Shiori [falling to her death](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h36m00s) while trying to explain to Gonathon, completely broke the battered witch and led to her ending her romance with Gonathon.\n\nDevastated and overcome with regret, Gonathon’s final moments of the day were spent being consoled by Tam Gandr. The queen urged Gonathon to think carefully about his feelings and who he truly loved. But despite all of these misfortunes and frustrations that Gonathon had inflicted on himself and others, Tam remained committed to Gonathon, and the two [parted on hopeful terms](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=5h6m45s). For hope was now something that Gonathon needed more than anything, and in his daily journal, he once again reflected on those that he loved and had loved. He ended by expressing a desire to make tomorrow a better day. Godspeed, Gonathon G.",

That was the theme of the dungeon, made clear from the moment they stepped inside. Day and night flickered like a faulty lantern, the sky shifting with every step. The trials? All timed. Every challenge ticked down ominously, each misstep shaving away precious seconds. Even the puzzles, though unforgiving, could be reset—_rewound_ as if the dungeon itself had bent to the flow of time. And then there were the platforms—eerie heads embedded in them, silent observers of every movement.

The keeper of the timeline, the one who mended fractures and corrected anomalies across dimensions. She wasn’t just a broke queen with an ego—she was _important_. A literal guardian of the universal clock.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the truth didn’t exactly come with celebratory fanfare.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it brought more headaches than clarity:\r\n\r\n- The love of her life, the devoted peasant who once adored her, and that unhinged green gremlin, who never missed a chance to stir chaos—_all_ of them were under the impression that she was a tyrant. A cold, dictatorial overlord (see [Kronii-IRyS: Tyrannical Ruler](#edge:irys-kronii)).\r\n\r\n- Speaking of the green one—Immerkind, obsessed with the Princess as always—nearly jumped off the deep end, and Kronii had to drag her back from the edge (see [Kronii-Immerkind: Drinks between Queen and Knight](#edge:cecilia-kronii)).\r\n\r\n- Getting dragged into adopting someone else's once daughter (see [Kronii-Bijou: Not Again...](#edge:bijou-kronii))\r\n\r\n- And to top it all off, Gonathon G, her ever-loyal servant, was in the middle of a love fiasco that she somehow got [blamed for](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=52HWNzLYw1YlgPp8&t=10344).

Nerissa’s, for example, looked as though she was opening her arms for a hug. Sure, Elizabeth still had a few awkward moments, but they were fewer now. The craftsmanship of Nerissa’s portrait was breathtaking, and paired with the subject—Nerissa in all her stunning glory—it was something Elizabeth wanted to frame for the world to admire... and for herself, most of all.\n\nShe placed the painting against the side of the building, gently illuminated by the warm glow of shroomlight.

Unfortunately for Gonathon G., his inability to reconcile his love for his queen and his love for his newfound companion would inevitably lead to heartbreak.\n\nFollowing his return from Star Site: Chronos and the reaffirmation of his role as Tam Gandr’s loyal knight (see [Kronii-Gonathon: The Queen’s Gambit](#edge:kronii-gigi)), Gonathon began to feel conflicted over whether it was right for him to seek love while in the queen’s service. Dismissing these thoughts for the time being, Gonathon assured Shiori that the [strong affinity](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=2h50m6s) they had still endured, and Shiori in turn gifted Gonathon with a ring, further cementing their bond.\n\n[What if when my memories returns](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=2h52m33s)\n\nThese tender moments would not last long, as soon after, Gonathon was called by Shakira to the destined blind date she had arranged with “the one who was perfected for Gonathon.” This was not Shiori however, but [Mordan Ramsey](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h11m48s) Gonathon’s fellow wolf and new therapist. Shiori, keen to keep an eye on Gonathon, snuck up on the date and began quarreling over Gonathon’s heart with the pink therapist. This resulted in the first of Gonathon’s many fumbles, as the hapless knight chose to [flee and seek direction from Tam Gandr](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h18m18s) rather than address the issue himself.\n\nUpon Gonathon’s return, Shiori expressed her reservations about the knight’s commitment. Indulging in her more manipulative and wily side, the witch announced that she was going to require Gonathon to [prove her devotion](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h39m36s), which included finishing the roof of her house and for the knight to swear to do anything Shiori asked for. While Gonathon was more than willing to accept, the knight had requirements of his own: that Tam Gandr live with them for at least a year and observe their relationship for any signs of misconduct. Reluctantly agreeing to these terms, the two held pinkies before briefly parting ways.\n\n[Devote yourself to me](#embed:https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h51m2s)\n\nUnfortunately, it was here that their budding romance was savagely nipped. For upon returning to her home, Gonathon found his queen and her wife seemingly engaged in an [affair](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h31m02s) on their bunk bed. Unwilling to wait for an explanation, the distraught knight fled, with Shiori in hot pursuit. Alas, the witch slipped and fell to her death, which deeply shocked Gonathon. The worst was yet to come, for Shiori accused Gonathon of pushing her to her demise, and it was this final act that served as the catalyst for the witch severing their romance for good.\n\nAny hopes Gonathon had of redeeming himself in Shiori’s eyes were quickly dashed, as Koseki Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Rock and a Hard Place](#edge:gigi-bijou)) explained to Gonathon that she had rekindled her past romance with Shiori, one that the gem was keen to not see break again. And thus, Gonathon’s second foray into love ended in tragedy. It remains to be seen if the Humble Knight has learned anything from this heartbreak, as it is lessons like these that will be needed in the days ahead.",

This was quickly interrupted by a gaggle of peasants who, having witnessed Tam’s power in the memory, were now seeking to get into her good graces. This sycophancy was short-lived, as the Breads soon attempted to spark a coup to depose Tam. Immediately rushing to her side, Gonathon reassured Tam that she would always support her, which deeply moved Tam.\n\n[You will always be my queen!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/BSPi8sTHdAY?si=k33dxJgsRB5jPFyu&t=9770)\n\nThe darker side of their bond soon reared its ugly head, as Gonathon’s memories of Tam included a supposed Pact of Celibacy she had taken, which flew straight in the face of her burgeoning relationship with Shiori of the Nyavellas (see [Gonathon-Shiori: Trials of the Witch](#edge:gigi-shiori)). Now deeply conflicted, Gonathon would call on Tam several times to provide guidance and permission. This included intervention in a quarrel between Mordan Ramsey and Shiori following a blind date gone wrong and came to a head when Gonathon requested that Tam not only supervise her relationship with Shiori but live with them on the top bunk for at least a year. Unwilling to lose her most treasured and only knight, Tam agreed to the [proposal](https://www.youtube.com/live/BSPi8sTHdAY?si=GZzaSx6FFBlTbIpm&t=12615).\n\nDespite Tam’s best (and worst) efforts, a critical misunderstanding shattered Shiori and Gonathon’s relationship: as she was inspecting the sleeping arrangements with Shiori, a hapless Gonathon witnessed what appeared to be an affair between the two and fled. This led to Shiori giving chase and falling to her death, an action that caused her to break off her romance with Gonathon.\n\nIn spite of all of this turmoil, Tam and Gonathon remained committed to one another, with Tam consoling Gonathon and confronting her about her relationship with Mordan Ramsey and Gonathon telling Tam of the wondrous statue the knight had built for her in the future. In a day filled with darkness and grief, the queen’s return was one of the sole shining lights for the knight, but it remains to be seen whether this bond will endure.\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"Bunkbed activities\" by Kawr](https://x.com/kawrrsz/status/1920100323001348357)\n\n[\"Cuck bunk\" by BunBBun](https://x.com/BunBBun1/status/1920236766730092572)",

It was then that Bijou came to offer her condolences. There were no grand gestures, no theatrics, just quiet honesty.\n\nThe two reminisced. About the laughter. The sadness. The adventures they’d shared. About the child they once had together. The conversation was soft, grounded—real. And in that stillness, something shifted. A moment that perhaps mended what was once cut. A thread that may yet be rewoven. Maybe, just maybe, there was a chance to begin again.\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"give what now?\" by Haaro](https://x.com/haaro_69/status/1920956572743741642)",

The knight explained that as the Inbreads and Wolves were mortal enemies, siding with one meant rejecting the other. While Bijou felt she had that dawg in her, she wasn’t sure of where her path lay at the moment.

Romance and drama continued to dominate the kingdom like an ever-thickening fog, only now it was messier, weirder, and tangled beyond belief.\n\nBefore diving into the chaos, the heroes took on what might be the final major dungeon: **Star Site: Chaos**. And true to its name, it was exactly that—chaotic. Unlike the previous dungeons, which had grand themes and solemn trials, this one felt more like a playground of silliness.\n\nPuzzles? More like party games. Deep concepts? Nah, just fun. And of course, luck was a major player—so even if the heroes performed flawlessly; they still had to pray the stars were on their side.\n\n![The heroes battling Stain King: Chaos](/images-opt/chaos.webp)\n\nNow, onto the real madness. Gonathon kind of redeemed himself. Shiori and Bijou reconnected. Elizabeth and Nerissa continued their little flirt-fest, though for one side it was all flowers and sunshine, while for the other, it was thunder and darkness. Bijou and Bae ended up in a legal custody battle over their child. Tam, Roa, and the hot pink lady spiraled into a love triangle slash maid-master relationship?

Upon completion, she recovered memories of Ouro Kronii and came to a simple yet powerful realization: having others around really did make all the [difference](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=6644s).\n\nNext came the Star Site: Chaos dungeon, presumably one of the last major ones and a particularly intriguing one, where the aspect of chance dictated the flow. Still, alongside Bijou, Shiori, and Nerissa, Elizabeth powered through and recovered the memories of [Hakos Baelz](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?si=1zrJ9s4OAUQLt_pm&t=9740).\n\nThen came a true test of strength and courage. The Outlander challenged Elizabeth to a duel—a trial to determine if the heroes were worthy of carrying the fate of the world. Though she stumbled a few times, Elizabeth held her ground and proved her worth.\n\nWith all the main tasks out of the way, the day slowly descended into madness. It started with a heartfelt conversation with [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=13255s), but somehow everything spiraled and the spotlight shifted to Nerissa. Even the gods themselves chimed in, calling out to Elizabeth to “give Nerissa a chance,” all due to a supposed misunderstanding that unfolded earlier in the day (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa](#edge:liz-nerissa)). The cape of wisdom also made a return.\n\nOnce the chaos subsided, Elizabeth wound down, penned a letter to Shakira expressing her appreciation, and finally called it a day.",

            "content": "The events of yesterday lingered in Kiara's mind, and it was with concern that Kiara asked Mordan for a private word. Underneath the Chef's Tavern, Kiara [inquired about Mordan's well-being](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=836); the blind date had ended horribly for everyone, but especially for her fellow wolf. Mordan reassured her that, though she liked Gonathon, she would prioritize his feelings. But seeing the way Mordan put aside her own feelings, seemingly burying them within, made Kiara concerned.\n\nIn the midst of their talk, Elizabeth, Kiara's Sugar Child, would come by to request a legendary upgrade stone—Kiara quickly provided it and was delighted to guess that it was a gift meant for a [certain Raven](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1045), as the other woman frequently left gifts for Elizabeth. Elizabeth, flustered but not denying it, left.\n\nThe conversation then turned to Gonathon and Mordan's attempts, as Gonathon's therapist, to help the Good Knight remember his past—[to remember his Pearl](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1128) to lead him in the right direction. That a new love isn't what Gonathon needs, but rather the companionship of others. Kiara wondered if Mordan was projecting her own feelings, as she too felt that recently.\n\nKiara went back to her forge to see if Nerissa had bought something earlier. Elizabeth commented in surprise as she remembered Nerissa complained of being poor, to which Kiara would playfully disagree—especially if one were to compare Nerissa's wealth to Elizabeth's own. As her Sugar Matron, Kiara would [give money](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1419), causing the other to be thankfully embarrassed. Kiara would also come across a rather [pretty pink panther](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1535), to whom she promised to go to the new dungeon later.\n\n[A comrade remembering...](#embed:https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1587)\n\nAnd it seems Roa might remember something. Kiara, of course, knew they had been part of the same guild before, but could it be a sign? Would her friend remember their treasured bonds?\n\nKiara left for the newer Remnant fields to search for materials and the new Enigmatic Stones, commenting on the mysteriousness of these materials compared to the more common ores. She met Mordan again, the Lorekeepers fighting together against the Stains before, shortly, finding what seemed to be [a grave for one called \"Anax.\"](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=4045) A journal left on the grave revealed a tragic tale.\n\nAt the job hall, Kiara would meet Ina and ask if she had received Kiara's letter. She did! [Ina would read out loud](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=4856). An apology for the slight yesterday, and Ina would wave it off, stating all is good, giving a potato as thanks.\n\nBy the wagon, Kiara found [Roa in a trance](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=5592). Perhaps a vision, one of Time, was coming back to her? While waiting for Roa to awaken, Kiara overheard Shiori complaining to Nerissa, guessing it was about Gonathon. [Kiara thought she could fix Shiori.](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=5673) Roa reawakened, and Kiara let her know they had found a group for the dungeon.\n\nBut it seemed it was not only Kiara and Shiori who were affected by the relationship drama. Kiara would comfort Gonathon when [he overheard others gossiping](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=6300).\n\nAnd soon, the hour came again: a new dungeon to dive, one with Chaos as its name. And chaos it was, for though the challenges were simple in nature, they weren't in effort. After more party games than fights, eventually, the group would encounter the boss and, as before, win the battle. Though... something was missed, as luck was not on their side and they missed out on the treasured disc.\n\nA chaotic memory unfolds: The Peasant The Bae's! Kiara likened the memory to her own, [more fun and silly than the memories before](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=8602). Another connection was how they helped others in simpler, but still meaningful, ways.\n\nBut it seemed the fight was not over. As she reported to the Princess, the Outlander returned, and soon, his history—and fate—was revealed. Now, [Kiara would prove her worth as a knight and hero](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=9733) against the Outlander, finishing the battle in her flaming Revelation. Now it seemed history would diverge, and the Outlander's fate may have finally changed. She left the Princess and Outlander alone, but before she did, a few questions were asked:\n\n[_What Does Libestal Mean to You?_ **TO SAVE THE LESBIANS!**](#embed:https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=9949)\n\nKiara noticed her fellow knight's struggle against the Outlander and offered to give her some equipment to help in the battle, [fulfilling that promise](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=10623) shortly after it was made. As she went to her forge, Nerissa passed by to see if there were legendary upgrade stones. Pleased by the day's earnings, she would see to restock her wares.\n\nElizabeth then returned in [victory](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11357)—besting the Outlander, totally on the first try of course. Kiara felt proud of Elizabeth's progress. The Red Knight was already strong, and to see her become stronger was admirable.\n\nBut unfortunately, that strength caused a tense situation: [Knight Bloodflame suddenly attacked Nerissa, calling her a witch,](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11940) when the latter came by to see Elizabeth. Kiara quickly pulled Nerissa aside and [reassured her](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11984) that those were not Elizabeth's true feelings, and that there was fondness within the Red Knight's heart for the Blue Chef. Time is what Elizabeth needs. Kiara promised to be a wingman, but... carefully this time.\n\nToday was a calmer day, and perhaps tomorrow would be a nice day off.\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"2 wolves, 1 big cat and a leader\" by Roronico](https://x.com/roronico1512/status/1920392409898168688)",

There was also love... and Gonathon's rather messy relationship. Bae called him to her PP Hole, concerned about his well-being after yesterday's _bombastic_ events. Glad to hear he was fine, she asked for his love advice. Bae was but a peasant, dumb (and poor) in many ways but especially in matters of the heart. A lesson her Mother never finished, but the heart didn't heed what the brain thought, stirring whenever she met the lovely Immerkind...

How could a peasant, in name, compare to royalty? Gonathon would give sound advice, reminding Bae that she had cared for Cecilia when she was in pain and that as heroes of another land, they must leave once evil had been defeated. That Cecilia's love may be fraught with inevitable heartbreak. Bae may still have a chance. A chance that a heartfelt letter may sway Cecilia's own heart.\r\n\r\n[A letter and a 5000 gold bouquet](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=1762)\r\n\r\nRings were too soon, but flowers gave the 'right' touch of Bae's intention.

But another worry crept in: what [comes after today's Dungeon?](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2262) If Peasant The Bae's memories returned; would her feelings stay the same? To preserve her feelings, Bae wrote her a letter first:\r\n\r\n[Dearest ImmerKind...](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2543)\r\n\r\n[Read \"My confession\"](#text:my-confession)\r\n\r\nWords flowed out like a steady river from Bae's quill, passion burning itself onto the parchment. Each feeling is transcribed carefully and precisely, hoping that the Fair Maiden can hear Bae's sincerity and ardent love. After being [proofread by others](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3130), the Hot Pink One notwithstanding her rating of 6/10, it was ready.\r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to Bae, there was another familial matter at hand. Bijou called; at first it seemed to be about enigmatic stones to be negotiated in person, but as they talked in Bae's PP Hole...\r\n\r\n[The 'hat' on Bae's head was her and Shiori's child, Khaos.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3580)\r\n\r\nBijou told Bae about her past, her mistakes, and Shiori's struggles to care for Khaos alone. The child was abandoned because of Bijou, and thus, [Bijou asked Bae to return Khaos to her so she can set things right](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3620), to their audience's shock and Bae's disgust. Righteous anger filled Bae as she denied Bijou's request. **Bae** was the one who stepped up for Khaos when no one would and cared for Khaos when no one did. Tensions were high, but it was a matter to be solved later.\r\n\r\nStar Site: Chaos. The new dungeon **spoke** to Bae. There was an [overwhelming sense of familiarity with each challenge](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=4434). Each game was _beautifully chaotic_, with no need for challenging puzzles, math questions, or overwhelming might. Just a little luck on the roll of a die. However, she had to reroll later to get that disk.\r\n\r\n[**WAAAAZZZZUUUUUPPPP**](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSFZwinYaaU)\r\n\r\nBae wasn't a peasant—she helped out _peasants_, like Charlie! That brat. Bae remembers now; he took her dice after all the help she gave him! And it's now lost! So, Bae _still_ was missing her full power. But, despite her newly found identity as Chaos, Bae couldn't let go of the Peasant title... keeping it [in Charlie's honor.](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=5680)\r\n\r\nBut all is not over, for there are a few more challenges. First, the Outlander. Bae must prove that she is [the hero this world needs](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6108) and overturn fate. A battle well fought and well won.\r\n\r\nSecond, there were Bae's memories. [Who was Mother](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6505) if Bae ever had one. Bae can remember Charlie fondly, reminiscing about the times they spent as she worked, but not a 'Mother.' Was perhaps, Mother... Brother? Was 'Brother' Charlie? It almost felt like the memories in Bae's head were in too much conflict for her to truly understand.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn't just Bae who was troubled, since a distressed Bijou soon called for help; [Bijou's beloved, Shiori, and Gonathon were talking once again](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=10880). Caught between trusting her wife and repeating her mistake, Bijou turned to Bae for advice. Despite the tensions earlier in the day, Bae still held Bijou as a friend. She told her to trust Shiori and that they could begin the custody battle/family therapy session with Mordan soon.\r\n\r\n[**_The dispute was... a Mess_**](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11850).\r\n\r\nIt was one filled with drama, tears, and deceit that soap operas can only dream of having. Inspired by a suggestion from Mordan, [Bae bought another hat/child](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11383) and [renamed the real Khaos](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11464) to test Bijou. A ploy that [Bijou fell for](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=12085), proving that Bae deserved primary custody. Not that anybody disagreed. But alas, the subject of home suitability came up, and, in an unexpected twist, Mordan's tavern seemed like the top choice for the children's home. A home that was accepted then dropped when everyone, except Gonathon, turned on Mordan after they mistakenly thought the chef insulted the group (it was only Shiori).\r\n\r\nTired and wary, [Bijou and Bae finally made amends](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13039h). As they watched the children play in Shiori's humble shack, they agreed that they went too far and that therapy doesn't really work. Bae gave her blessing for Bijou and Shiori to visit Khaos. Gonathon would step up to help [provide for the child as well.](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13387) Bae would also need to build the children's room, but that is a task for another day.\r\n\r\n[Oh, and Bae is also mother to another child.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13027)\r\n\r\nBut another matter lingered in Bae's mind: Cecilia Immerkind. As a worried Gonathon pulled her away to talk, Bae explained that some of her memories might be linked to her missing box. But her focus right now was the Kind Knight. Bae would give the letter [to Cecilia](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13807) in person and present her with flowers afterwards. Touched, Gonathon promised to help Bae when the moment arrived.\r\n\r\n## Fanart\r\n\r\n[\"you need to pay for the three wishes\" by R-Lus](https://x.com/RLus654/status/1920313961980793313)",

            "content": "Seemingly unfazed by the previous day’s chaos, Shiori started off her morning productively by helping others get through the Star Site: Chronos dungeon. It was nice—being helpful, motivated, and untouched by drama… well, for a little while, anyway.\n\nInevitably, she got dragged into the madness. But more often than not, she played the role of a distant observer, silently watching the chaos unfold around her.\n\n[She likes to observe](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?t=17280)\n\nIn the situations where she was involved, she often felt more like a background prop being shuffled around than a key player—take, for example, the convoluted tale involving her old child with Bijou, which spiraled into a full-on legal dispute (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:bae-bijou)).\n\nShe did make time to join the others for the new [Star Site: Chaos dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?t=7733) and even fought the Outlander—you know, the actual main quest that somehow got buried under all the emotional wreckage.\n\nLike the others, Shiori was then challenged by the Outlander to a duel—a trial, more than a true battle. A test to determine whether the heroes were worthy of inheriting his role of destroying the Heart of Ruin and saving the world.\n\nAnd in classic Shiori fashion, she took the opportunity to jab, tease, and prod. She mocked the Outlander, though at first, it seemed like her usual playful snark. But then, her tone shifted—less whimsical, more biting. Her words carried an odd weight, a hint of something deeper. She spoke not just to the Outlander but also to herself. About how they were alike.\n\n[You and I are similar, after all](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?si=4vKuhvHq9ARFIyAF&t=8794)\n\nTwo people who _\"watch over stories, and feel conflicted that they can’t be part of them,\"_ who _\"break the rules often.\"_\n\nThey weren’t throwaway lines. Not from someone who speaks as if they know more than they should. Not from someone who holds a role bigger than what’s visible on the surface.\n\nWhat did she mean by that? Did it tie into her title—Archiver?\n\nLater, when the Princess and the Outlander asked the heroes about their reason for saving the kingdom, the others gave answers that varied: confusion, pride, and profit. But Shiori’s answer was different.\n\n[The scripts](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?si=GlbL7dJkjV0wglfU&t=9223)\n\n\"I'm just doing my job, and being a dirty, horrible self-inserter like him.\"\n\n\"I'm fighting for my duty, because I am Shiori Nyavella.\"\n\nNot for the world. Not for the people. Not even for herself. But for her _role_. A role she never clearly explained. A role she seemed to fully _know_, even if no one else did.\n\nSelf-inserter? Into what, exactly? A story? Was she hinting at something more... meta?\n\nMaybe she was just being her strange, eccentric self. Or maybe, just maybe, Shiori Nyavella wasn’t merely a witch with a pen and a sharp tongue—but something far more.\n\nStill, not everything had to be tangled in mystery. At least one of the questions had a charmingly down-to-earth answer: the mess of romance and rivalry she’d stumbled into. The Orange Knight, so humble, so earnest, had completely upended her world. Turned her story on its head. And now, she was left picking up the emotional debris of their ever-complicated dynamic (see [Shiori–Gonathon](#edge:gigi-shiori)).\n\nShe ended her day with rare, quiet moments—sharing them with [Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?t=15814) and later, a bonding conversation with a sleepy Elizabeth. All of it, as always, inked into her diary—yet another page, yet another piece of the puzzle that was Shiori.\n\n[A moment to cool down](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?si=Zv5vHxEzlcKhAmcH&t=18947)",

It didn’t.\r\n\r\nNerissa couldn’t stop thinking about Elizabeth. It seemed like the Red Knight had been keeping her distance—ignoring her, brushing her off—and as soon as she noticed it, something inside Nerissa had begun to fracture. She _thought_ there was something between them. Something special. And now? Now she felt unwanted. Unseen.\r\n\r\nDesperate for clarity, she turned to Mordan for comfort. Therapy, really.\r\n\r\n[Hi, so I'm emotionally devastated](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/m5VOeHvSgbI?si=Yoxf24-6Bl_RxZ_d&t=13280)\r\n\r\nShe spilled everything—her frustration, her jealousy, her fears, her heartbreak. She admitted, openly, that she was in love with Lady Bloodflame. And surprisingly, Mordan didn’t laugh, didn’t push her away. She listened. She offered earnest advice, support, and warmth. And for the first time that day, Nerissa felt the weight on her chest lift—if only a little.\r\n\r\nIt still hurt. Of course it did. But it was a start. She wrote it all down in her [journal](https://www.youtube.com/live/m5VOeHvSgbI?si=9RnBbuaougRXlp3M&t=14505) later—everything she couldn't say aloud. And though Mordan had gently encouraged her to confess her feelings, Nerissa wasn’t ready. Not yet.\r\n\r\nWorn down both physically and emotionally, she wandered into the casino and started throwing her coins into the void. Coping mechanism? Absolutely. Sulking? Definitely. But could anyone blame her? The one person she admired most was suddenly out of reach, and the sting of that cut deeper than she expected. If things stayed this way, she wasn’t sure how much longer she could keep it up...\r\n\r\n[Anything but blue](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/m5VOeHvSgbI?si=aKruKVQY9bhwM8QD&t=15357)\r\n\r\nBut maybe—just maybe—she was overthinking it all. Maybe things weren’t as bleak as they seemed (see [Elizabeth–Nerissa](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\r\n\r\nAnd to close out her long, exhausting day, Nerissa bought herself a hat. Not just any hat—a big, red, slightly ridiculous one. But to her, it was perfect. A memento of her first journey, of old friends now gone, of the bonds that shaped her into who she was. It was warm. Familiar. Precious.\r\n\r\n[Scarlet Wand is here to stay](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/m5VOeHvSgbI?si=E38tf2lpApnGGgE7&t=16218)\r\n\r\nTomorrow would be a new day.

Hidden in a corner, she read it out loud.\n\n[Doki doki](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=515)\n\n[Read \"The Princess 1\"](#text:the-princess-1)\n\nIt was only 10 pages long like she asked, but… it ended on a cliffhanger!

Whatever happened after that wasn’t Bijou’s problem at that point.\n\n---\n\nAfter her revisit to Star Site: Chronos, [she called up Peasant Bae](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=7980), asking for materials for her shop, as she ran out after serving Gonathon. This was how Bijou decided to bait her into trying to get Khaos back…\n\nVeiled behind a regular business transaction, Bijou confronts the Peasant about the Stain hat on her head. She and Shiori had previously abandoned the baby back in the illusory Libestal, and now she wants it back.\n\nBae strongly believed she had been taking better care of Khaos since she found it; after all, Bae did the right thing to free them from the shackles of slavery (see [Bijou-Bae](#edge:bae-bijou)). _(How it traveled back in time with the warriors was never explained.)_\n\nThat said, they would have to set their differences aside for the time being. It was time for Bijou to investigate Star Site: Chaos, and later, a duel with [the Outlander](#node:outlander).\n\nThe dialogue she had with the Princess and the Outlander after the duel had Bijou pause to think deeply for a moment. Although she was being asked about the fate of Libestal, she couldn’t just think of that when asked this one question:\n\n[“What does Libestal mean to you?”](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=11473)\n\n---\n\nFast-forwarding to the end of the day, after one hectic therapy session later, Bijou and Shiori decided to cool down by [writing their daily journals](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=19395) together inside the therapy shack. But the day’s tension was not over.\n\nAs the two were about to submit their daily journals to the Library, they walked into Tam and IRyS. The queen was confessing her love to IRyS. Bijou sees this all go down from a distance, not even thinking at first to go to her brother’s side.\n\nAnd then, broke the news. IRyS... was EXPECTING?! Hearing what Tam and IRyS were saying the Princess started to spiral too.\n\n[\"Is no person in this kingdom good?!\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=20720)\n\nTo try to bring comedic relief to the situation, Bijou asks if it’s just gas she is feeling. Then again, if it was real, maybe a [gender reveal party](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=20922) was in order. Shiori could easily provide for that.\n\nBijou had to speak to someone about this. Though now without a therapist, [Shiori lends both her and Gonathon her ear](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21122)—promising to be completely unbiased. Unlike that reaper/lorekeeper/tavern keeper.\n\nThis was mainly Gonathon’s time to speak his mind about what he felt. Bijou had also given her two cents on the matter, coming from her blood-pact relation to IRyS. She leaves Shiori and Gonathon alone after the latter leaves to go see where IRyS is.\n\n---\n\n**_(Content Warning Ahead)_**\n\nBijou returned to doing her business when she noticed an [eerie, deafening silence](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21666). Only Elizabeth and Shiori were around in the building area. She thought of calling her brother to see what was up… [just in the nick of time](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21724).\n\nThis was how Bijou found out that her brother was thinking of going away… forever. She didn’t have the entire context for why—all she knew was that she had been berated. She rushed as fast as she could to go save her.\n\nBased on what she said her location was, her instincts led her to the Antigonian Aerie. She loved her Onii-chan so much… so much that she would follow wherever she went. Even if it meant _diving off a cliff right next to her._\n\n[The goddess is descending.](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21847)\n\nGonathon and Tam jumped off with them. While they survived the fall, IRyS and Bijou both perished for a brief moment.\n\nThe blood-pact brothers respawned on the warp point, seemingly given a second chance.\n\nIRyS’ pain subsided briefly, but it came back. Is the baby… still there? IRyS believes so; she’s a goddess, after all. But could the baby be an eldritch being, a demigod, or both? Or is it just food after all? _Only time will tell._ They still plan to surprise her consort (Ina) with the news the next day.\n\n---\n\nAfter this traumatic experience, she [meets with Shiori again](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=22527) to talk about the circumstances of the gender reveal party. After the absolute chaos that ensued that day, they sat on the front porch of the house next to the wagon. Elizabeth was there as well. It’s at this moment when Princess Bijou, ever innocent, asked the Red Knight…\n\n[\"Are truly good people in this world?\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=22748)\n\nThey also spent some time gossiping about the lore of the kingdom so far before heading out. Bijou listened to Elizabeth’s answer to her question in earnest, but she wasn’t convinced.\n\nShe had already turned in her journal; her thoughts had not changed. She needs some time to think about it. To see if her words were true. Her worldview had turned more cynical after today.\n\nShe does admit, at least, that she needed that talk with the Red Knight. She needed that moment to look up in the sky and at the buildings in front of them. It eased her mind at least a little.\n\nDespite her rock-hard appearance, today proved our Princess Bijou had a soft, emotional core prone to crumbling in the face of drama. She wonders if she could handle existing in this universe.\n\n_\"We will have to see what tomorrow brings.\"_\n\nShe went to bed with her dearly beloved that night.",

            "content": "**What Does It Mean to Be a Knight?**\n\nThe previous day’s events had left Gonathon G a broken and deeply troubled knight. However, as the sun rose on a new day, Gonathon was resolute in his desire to seek redemption and improve.\n\nFirst, Gonathon paid a visit to his therapist, Mordan Ramsey, whom he had desperately petitioned for aid the night before (see [Calli-Gonathon: Confidently Confidential](#edge:calli-gigi)). Beginning their session in earnest, Mordan implored the knight to fight for his own beliefs and code, rather than blindly following the wishes of others. She further told a [love story](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=964) between a maiden and a knight, one that was deeply familiar to Gonathon (and was, in fact, one of him and his Pearl).\n\n[You are the master of your own fate](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=1076)\n\nGonathon’s travels that day would see him lending aid to many people, including those he had every right to see as rivals or foes. For Princess Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Good Neighbors](#edge:gigi-bijou)), the one who was now betrothed to his former love, Gonathon apologized for using Shiori to fill the hole in his heart left by his Pearl, and the two promised to always help one another. And for Peasant the Bae (see [Bae-Gonathon: A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed](#edge:bae-gigi)), who Gonathon had feared was corrupted and threatening the land, Gonathon gave her the courage to confess to Immerkind, seeking to make right the error he had committed in shackling Immerkind’s heart to the Princess. Even the Hot Pink One—perhaps the least deserving of any generosity—the Humble Knight swore to serve as a loyal guard dog, although this would prove to be a troublesome arrangement in due time.\n\nSoon after, Gonathon joined up with the Wolf Pack to tackle the next dungeon. Here, Gonathon had a heart-to-heart with Shakira that saw the phoenix consoling Gonathon on his personal strife and arranging for Mordan to groom the scruffy knight. Free of fleas and full of determination, Gonathon fought alongside the Pack in Star Site: Chaos, besting its games of chance and ferocious Stain King. Following a revelation of the peasant’s true identity, Gonathon found himself face-to-face with the Outlander.\n\n[Take this! Revelation!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=7292)\n\nAn intense duel saw Gonathon emerging victorious and a flood of memories returning. When asked why he fought and what Libestal meant to him, Gonathon [responded resoundingly](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=7383): from now on, he would not fight simply because of blind duty, but because it was what he believed in. For him, Libestal meant kindness, compassion, and, above all, always fighting for what you believed in.\n\n[For my code, for my honor! The way of a knight!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=7585)\n\nFollowing this, Gonathon met with the aloof, but deeply familiar, Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame (see [Elizabeth-Gonathon: Honor and Justice](#edge:liz-gigi)). As a fellow knight, Liz had become concerned with Gonathon’s dealings with Shiori. She, too, asked Gonathon what he was fighting for, and after being asked what she thought of Gonathon, the Scarlet Knight described the [deep kinship](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10855) she felt for Gonathon, Immerkind, and Roa. The two agreed they shared a special bond and resolved to fight for an even higher cause than mere honor or love: that of Justice. Filled with resolve, Gonathon went forth to confront his greatest challenge of the day: reconciling with Shiori.\n\n[The Knights heed the call for Justice](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10989)\n\nThe [reunion of the diamond and black pearl](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11506) proved bittersweet. Shiori lamented Gonathon’s flaws, both past and present. Yet despite all Gonathon had done wrong, Shiori assured the knight that he had a good heart. It was this good heart that was on display as, during an intense couple’s therapy session and child custody battle between Bae and Shiori and Bijou, Gonathon would assist in smoothing out the difficulties they shared, even promising to provide monetary support to the child. The new family, dubbed State Farm, parted on happy terms, and following a final heart-to-heart with Mordan, in which he provided career advice to his former therapist, Gonathon prepared to turn in for the night.\n\n[A happy ending… for now](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=14038)\n\nBut his most grueling trial was yet to come, for yet another figure needed Gonathon’s aid: his beloved queen, Tam Gandr (see [Gonathon-Kronii: The Sham Queen’s Sacrifice](#edge:kronii-gigi)). Tam had become enslaved by the deviant HPO and had fallen into a pit of despair, not unlike that which Gonathon had experienced the previous day. [Enraged](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15494) that his queen would be treated this way, Gonathon implored Tam to stand up for herself and demand the respect she was owed as a monarch. The queen was moved to tears, thanking Gonathon for always standing with her, even at her lowest. Sadly, HPO arrived before Tam could be properly steeled, and Gonathon was forced to flee in tears as Tam fell to the foul goddess’s mercy.\n\n[The Queen’s Most Loyal, Treasured Knight](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15915)\n\nUnwilling to abandon his queen and treasured friend, Gonathon charged back into the fray, only to find that Tam had heeded his advice and laid low the degenerate pink creature. After foiling an attempt by HPO to escape her responsibility, Gonathon and Tam had a [bewildering heart-to-heart](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=18669) in which the knight convinced the queen to seek a more equal role in the relationship… and expanded cat-kissing rights. Thus Gonathon’s first steps to redemption came to an end, and while the knight still had much work to do, he resolved to stay optimistic and hold his head high.\n\n[Writing the daily journal](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16249)",

There, they uncovered Bae's lost memories—turns out, she was more than just some quirky [peasant girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PukMnVXnJMo&t=2307s). Afterward, Tam was challenged by the Outlander himself. It was a challenge, alright, with the Outlander easily wiping the floor with her regal robes as Queen Tam was put in the dirt over and over due to her weak equipment.\n\nThis prompted the Queen to get better charms for herself, but in true Queen Tam fashion, she just had to [overcomplicate things](https://youtu.be/PukMnVXnJMo?t=3165). It wasn't even about not having the money for the \"Gacharms\"—she had some coins. She just wanted to appear special, maybe even getting a discount from the shop.\n\nAnd so, using her newly regained memories to her unfair advantage, the Queen did the unthinkable and told Roa Pandora of their shared romantic history from the previous timeline and used the lingering [romantic feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PukMnVXnJMo&t=3653s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH) to con the poor big cat into giving her free charms. Even as she agonized over the monster she had become, the deed was done. All she could do was defeat the Outlander to somehow make up for it.\n\nThe plot thickened when Roa, Queen Tam, and the Hot Pink One (yes, the very same one Queen Tam began having a secret affair with the other day—and who just so happens to be Roa’s master, as Roa was her pet) decided to [team up for the day’s dungeon](https://youtu.be/PukMnVXnJMo?t=5771) again in search of treasure. The Queen was quite literally playing a dangerous game by juggling two women at the same time.\n\nIt went about as well as you’d expect: chaotic, emotionally confusing, and infinitely frustrating, as they were forced to do the dungeon over and over due to failing to acquire the treasure in it, which required a certain amount of luck, and all while leaving a trail of drama in its wake (see [Roa-Kronii](#edge:kronii-raora)).\n\nAbove all else, the humiliation that befell the Queen on this day reached heights—or depths—that even shook her own Humble Knight, Gonathon (see [Gigi-Kronii](#edge:kronii-gigi)).\n\nBefore the day could properly end, the ongoing drama with the Hot Pink One escalated to the point of her jumping off a cliffside, even as Queen Tam, Gonathon, and Bijou tried to stop her from doing so (see [Kronii-IRyS: Abdomen Pain](#edge:irys-kronii)).\n\nWith that, the day ended as the Queen finished writing her [journal of woes](https://youtu.be/PukMnVXnJMo?t=16515).",

Personal. The Princess’s favorite doll, a gift from her mother, the Queen. A doll meant to watch over her, to protect her when no one else could. The Queen had been gentle, wise, and endlessly kind—a beacon of peace amidst growing chaos.\n\nAnd yet, even she couldn’t escape the tragedy caused by the Ruination.\n\nPossessed by the corruption hidden within a seemingly harmless hairpin, the Queen’s own handmaiden turned against her. Driven mad, the handmaiden committed the unthinkable: regicide. It happened in an instant, yet painfully long enough for the young Princess to bear witness to the murder of her mother.\n\n\"Nothing stays pure,\" the handmaiden had murmured again and again, her voice empty, as if repeating a truth too ancient and cruel to be denied. She was swiftly dealt with, but the damage was irreversible.\n\nLater, as the corruption continued to spread and the King prepared for war, the Princess entrusted him with her doll—perhaps believing in its protective magic, perhaps simply hoping it would keep him close to her in spirit. But the King, too, never returned.\n\nThe doll never came back either.\n\nAnd just like that, the Princess was left alone—an orphan in a crumbling kingdom.\n\nWhen these memories returned to Fia, she merely bowed her head, thanked the heroes for helping her recover what was lost, and quietly let them continue on their way.\n\nNo grand realization—only silence.\n\nAnd in that silence, more questions than answers.",

Yet the memory placed particular emphasis on the doll—a keepsake from the Princess’s mother, later passed to her father, the doll promised to watch over and protect whoever it was given to.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Outlander finally revealed his true identity as the Watcher. After witnessing the heroes' unwavering determination to save the world, he chose to entrust them with that burden. For the first time, he agreed not to shoulder it himself—so that he might avoid punishment from the Higher Being.\r\n\r\n#### Updated NPCs:\r\n\r\n- See [Fia](#node:fia)\r\n- See [Outlander](#node:outlander)",

He had seen a future where the Ruination consumed all. But he claimed he had changed. That was why he took on the guise of the nameless swordsman, to destroy the Heart of Ruin and stop the Ruination from devouring everything. Still, he couldn’t accept the idea that, in doing so, he would become a far greater evil.\r\n\r\nAnd so, he issued a challenge to the heroes—not out of malice, but to test their strength, to see if they were truly worthy of being entrusted with the fate of the world.\r\n\r\n[Prove your worth](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=4220s)\r\n\r\nThe duel was brutal, unforgiving, but the heroes stood their ground and emerged victorious.\r\n\r\nYet, both the Princess and the Outlander were left questioning: why? Why go to such lengths? Why would these shining stars fight so hard to save a world that wasn’t even theirs?\r\n\r\nAnd to answer that question, to solidify their resolve and earn his trust, the heroes gave their honest, heartfelt answers.\r\n\r\n[The reasons why](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?si=BGrT9i5eJGGAoNcL&t=11841)",

Lonely.\n\nA small Stain-looking child sits among the similarly looking hats in one of Libestal's shops.\n\nShe's been here for a long while now, just waiting for someone. Memories of the past were too painful to remember—a feeling of warmth now left terribly cold.\n\n\"Oh! I want this one, my good fellow!\"\n\nWarm hands suddenly, but oh so gentle, took her from the pile to be placed on a head with soft red hair. Though scared at first, Khaos soon found herself carried almost everywhere; from the peaceful fields of Libestal to the admittedly terrifying Dungeons, Khaos was never alone. Not anymore.\n\nIt was frightening at first, to suddenly be in the hands, well, head, of a stranger. But that feeling was quick to fade. The redhead, Peasant The Bae, would look at Khaos warmly as if she was more than just a simple mistaken hat.\n\nAs if she were a child that deserved to be treasured.\n\nUnwittingly, Khaos overheard much of Bae's random muttering about her own mother. One who would speak of lessons when Bae was younger, to guide the young rat in the wise ways of peasantry. Khaos would listen silently and wonder, is this what it's like to have a 'mother'?\n\nSo, the child and Mother would spend their days in Libestal; the child watching and learning, the mother mining and crafting. The mother would ensure the child does not fall from her head by accident while going up the waterfall.\n\nOf course, when there are peaceful days, there too must be days of hardship, Khaos remembered her mother saying once.\n\nOne such day came in the form of a shiny princess called Bijou. Khaos would note warily that the Princess would stare at her at times, intensely, as if memories would come back to her if Bijou stared at Khaos long enough. Khaos, in turn, would wonder why the princess looked oddly familiar.\n\nEventually, the past unveiled itself:\n\nBijou would confront Bae about Khaos, about her regrets, about her foolishness, and the intent to make things right—to Khaos's other mother, at least.\n\nKhaos was too young to remember the past, but all she wanted was the present. Her Mother.\n\nIt only brought a large sense of relief when Mother refused to part with her. That Mother viewed Khaos as a child of her own.\n\nIt was terrifying to see Mother so angry against everyone, and Khaos was glad to see that everyone reconciled in the end. Though she's a little bit wary of princess mother, it seems she did not dislike Khaos.\n\nNow, Khaos waits for a new room. One for her and her new little sibling too!\n\n(see [Bae-Bijou](#edge:bae-bijou))",

A secret? A lie?\n\nI followed, curious, heart in hand,\nShe turned and screamed—I didn’t understand.\n[“Witch!”](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=2890s) she cried, again, again,\nNot once in jest, it stung like then.\nShe chased me off like I’d done sin.\n\nLater still, I sought to trade,\nAn Upgrade Stone, a fair exchange.\nShe stopped me short, said I had guessed\nAll wrong. My chest—tight, compressed.\nWas I [unwelcome](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=2960s) now, unlike the rest?\n\nThen—roses, [roses](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=12426s), her room aglow.\nNot mine.

I couldn’t say.\nThe thorns inside began to fray.\n\nNo meaning made, no truth aligned.\nI searched her gaze—found no sign.\nWhat does she want? Why can’t I see?\nIs it her fault… or maybe me?\nThis storm won’t pass, it won’t let me be.\n\nAnd so, I sat in quiet gloom,\nMy heart a ghost that filled the room.\nAll signs confused, all roads misled,\nI told myself, “It’s over,”\nAnd let the sadness spread.\n\n...\n\nThen—\nA hand. A warmth. A [gentle pat](https://www.youtube.com/live/m5VOeHvSgbI?si=t7-UotzcICQjtvlw&t=16175).\nA silly smile. A moment passed.\nShe called me “witch” with laughter now.\nI felt the hurt begin to drown.\nAnd just like that... I came back down.\n\nIf witch is what she wants from me,\nThen so I’ll be, in full esprit.\nI’ll stir my spells in pots of stew,\nAnd wait until her heart shows through.\n\nA love like ours, strange and sublime—\nIt hurts. It heals.

Acting high and mighty, like some smug master lording over her loyal servant.\n\nTam, ever proud, ever regal—a Queen—had to grit her teeth and endure it all. Not because she wanted to, but because she chose to. For the pink one.

Yes, pregnant. That little detail.\n\n[Pregante](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=14395s)\n\nThe reveal was so shocking it rendered Tammy mute. But really—why?

The sagely Mordan then began to tell a love story between a kindhearted knight and a maiden that seemed [eerily familiar](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=974), but Gonathon continued to insist she was not worthy of love and loyal to her queen. Mordan insisted that blind loyalty was “ick” and that Gonathon needed above all else to make decisions for her own sake. Gifting Gonathon a beautiful mural of herself (which Gonathon sneakily returned the favor by placing her own mural in Mordan’s home), the two parted for the time being.\n\nLater, the wolf pack once again assembled to delve into a dungeon. It was here that the wily Shakira once again brought the therapist and knight together by convincing Mordan to [groom](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=5062) the scruffy knight of the fleas afflicting her. The pack then descended into the dungeon, and although it was difficult, they easily proved victorious. Having overcome two trials with Gonathon, one of the mind and another of the realm, the two seemingly said farewell for the day.\n\n[What exactly is the Wolf Pack?](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=4946)\n\nAlas for poor Mordan, these trials would pale in comparison to what would come next; however, the hardship would come not from the knight, but from the quarreling Peasant Bae and Princess Bijou (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:bae-bijou)) who were engaged in a custody battle for Khaos. The lengthy, grueling couples therapy that followed saw Gonathon serving as a voice of reason, but sadly the other three left in disgust following an outburst by Mordan calling out what she saw as their prejudices.\n\n[God, she is so f\\*\\*king crazy](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=13255)\n\nA crestfallen Mordan vowed to give up therapy forever, but Gonathon insisted her skills had proven invaluable to bringing the knight back from the brink of despair. Trading places with Mordan, Gonathon now sat in the therapist’s chair. She repeated a [line of advice](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=13671) she had given Bijou days before: to not allow the misery of customer service to take the twinkle out of her eye. The Humble Knight implored Mordan to take up fortune telling instead, as not only could she help people, but the blame would be solely on the gods. Thoroughly amused, Mordan replied that she would consider it, and the two wolves ended their day on a much happier note than before.\n\n[You have a heart of gold](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=13585)",

It was to Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Good Neighbors](#edge:gigi-bijou)) that the subject of the witch would come to the spotlight, with Gonathon expressing her regret for using Shiori to fill the hole in her heart left by the loss of her Pearl. The witch and the knight would not stay apart for long though, and Gonathon soon found herself once again waiting outside Shiori’s door.\n\n[My Fumbling Knight](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11508)\n\nOverhearing a phone conversation between Shiori and Liz, Shiori held nothing back in expressing her disgust for Gonathon’s actions. This did not dent the knight’s resolve and he quickly confronted Shiori directly. The witch continued to [hold nothing back](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12262), referring to Gonathon as a fumbling knight and disparaging him for requiring so much support to commit to his actions in the past. Chief of all, Shiori presented a question that Gonathon had himself deeply considered: that Gonathon was simply treating her as a salve for his wounded heart and that as a [Black Pearl](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12317), she was simply an imitation of the real thing.\n\nDespite all that Gonathon had done, and despite admitting he was still a fool, Shiori could not deny her feeling that the knight deep down was a [good person](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12416). Gonathon, for his part, apologized to the witch and expressed regret for the way he had treated her. However, Gonathon’s role in Shiori’s story was far from over. Recruited by Bijou as a form of “moral support,” Gonathon played witness to the intense custody battle between Peasant the Bae and Shiori and Bijou. Wanting to play his part in the child’s upbringing, Gonathon vowed to provide funds for child support and, in turn, joined the newly formed State Farm family.\n\n[We’re good neighbors!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=14029)\n\nFrom there, Shiori would attempt to dissuade Gonathon from being too brash about assisting Tam Gandr, although her words were unable to restrain the loyal knight from leaping to his queen’s defense. As the witch and knight parted for the final time that day, it was abundantly clear that Shiori was far from done with the Humble Knight, and in some ways, may just be getting started in pulling his strings.\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"humble knight more like fumble knight\" by Gardener](https://x.com/jhgardener_/status/1920897502833787226)",

For the queen had found herself not only destitute following several poor spending choices but had even ruined her relationships with the Hot Pink One and Roa. Stripped of her dignity and [blackmailed](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15489) by those she once loved, it was now her turn to seek the aid of the knight who, the previous day, she had wrenched from his own abyss.\n\nInitially seeking therapy from Mordan, however, upon learning of her retirement, Tam begged Gonathon to help her. Spilling her guts about the horrific situation she found herself in, not even the revelation that Gonathon had somehow ended up in HPO’s service herself (see [Gonathon-Irys: No Goddesses or Queens, only Grems](#edge:irys-gigi)) could dissuade Tam from seeing the knight as her last hope. The queen’s faith was well placed, for upon hearing of Tam’s enslavement to HPO, Gonathon flew into a rage and implored the queen to fight for her dignity and status as a monarch.\n\n[It’s over… it’s so over](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15613)\n\nGonathon mused over their options, including taking HPO to court, while a shellshocked Tam thanked Gonathon for his [purity and unbreakable loyalty](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15872). Alas, nothing could be done at the moment, for the vile goddess had discovered Kronii and commenced ravaging her in front of the Humble Knight. Despite wishing to remain by her queen’s side, Tam’s tearful plea not to witness her humiliation forced Gonathon to retreat, but not before promising to return. Writhing with frustration over the queen’s plight, Gonathon was briefly consoled by Shiori and Bijou, but their words imploring the knight to not get involved only served to harden the knight’s resolve: he had to save his queen!\n\n[I don’t want you to see me like this…](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16167)\n\nRushing to her queen’s side once more, Gonathon was shocked to find that Tam Gandr had turned the tables on the degenerate pink Nephilim, who was now groveling at Tam’s feet. Joining forces with Tam, the two of them, along with Bijou, talked HPO out of [jumping to her demise](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17973) (although this did still occur, with Tam and Gonathon surviving the fall). Gonathon had a truly perplexing heart-to-heart with Tam and urged her to stand up for herself and earn more respect, along with cat-kissing rights. Flabbergasted, but still thankful for her knight’s steadfast loyalty, Tam praised Gonathon for all he had done. Witnessing one final exchange between HPO and the queen in which Tam stated that Gonathon was all she needed, Gonathon departed, content with the good deeds he had done for his beloved queen.\n\n[I guess we’re kissing cats now?](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=18803)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"A knight and queen in sync...\" by LLCole](https://x.com/LLCole_/status/1922040765531718058)",

At this point the goddess simply demanded tribute, and, busy with other tasks, Gonathon departed for the dungeon.\n\nAfter assisting State Farm with couple’s therapy (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:bae-bijou)), Gonathon once again encountered HPO as she was desperately seeking therapy following a series of unfortunate events with Tam Gandr (see [Irys-Kronii: Nice Boat](#edge:irys-kronii)). Completely oblivious to the maelstrom of controversy that had erupted between the queen and the goddess, Gonathon offered to assist HPO despite them being in opposing factions.

However, the Humble Knight soon learned that his intended target would be none other than his beloved queen.\n\n[You did what?!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15178)\n\nTam quickly revealed to Gonathon the extent of HPO’s depravity (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Sham Queen Sacrifice](#edge:kronii-gigi)). Enraged over the treatment of his queen, Gonathon pleaded with Tam to not allow HPO to demean her in such a manner. Alas, Tam was seemingly powerless to oppose HPO, and upon HPO’s return and renewed degeneracy towards the queen, Gonathon was forced to make a tactical retreat at [Tam’s behest](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16162).\n\nUnwilling to simply abandon his queen to the deviant goddess, Gonathon rushed back in to assist Tam. It was there that Gonathon witnessed an incredible scene: Tam taking his words to heart and [bringing HPO to heel](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17471). HPO, shedding any semblance of being a respectable goddess, fled with her tail between her legs before threatening to jump to her demise. It was through the combined efforts of Gonathon, Tam, and Bijou that HPO was eventually talked down.\n\n[Hope attempts to descend](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17972)\n\nFollowing a bewildering but heartfelt conversation with Gonathon, Tam was able to reconcile with HPO and reach a mutual understanding that would see her honor restored and her cat-kissing privileges upgraded. While HPO was quick to demean Gonathon, the queen hastily [defended](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=19836) the Humble Knight, who was watching in secret. And thus the most contrived filler arc came to a close.",

Bae, having previously attempted to assist Gonathon in the previous day’s trials with Shiori of the Nyavellas, was deeply concerned with the knight’s wellbeing. Upon assuring Bae she was doing better, Gonathon responded by asking what was on the peasant’s mind. Bae proceeded to spill her guts: that she was [in love with Immerkind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=1994s) but hesitant to express her feelings due to Immerkind’s obsession with the Princess of Libestal.\n\nGonathon rebuffed her concerns, stating that she should [follow her heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=2158s) and urged the peasant to write a letter laying her feelings bare for Immerkind. Although the two agreed that marriage was perhaps too hasty, Bae fervently thanked Gonathon for her advice and promised to make good on the courage the knight had given her. Later, Gonathon would proofread the letter along with NinoIna, and the heartfelt and passionate feelings expressed in it moved the two to tears.\n\nGonathon’s next encounter with Bae would not be in person, but rather through [memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=6486s) obtained in Star Site: Chaos. From there, Gonathon learned that Bae was in fact a trickster Djinn capable of granting wishes. However, the clumsiness and foolishness showcased by the peasant-turned-genie in the memory did little to change Gonathon’s perception of her, and the knight continued to treat her as an equal and a friend.\n\nSadly, the knight and peasant’s next encounter would be far from pleasant, as Gonathon was drawn into the custody conflict between Bae, Shiori, and Bijou over the fate of the their child, Khaos. Following a protracted and bitter feud between the parties, they eventually agreed to share custody, with Gonathon joining the newly formed [State Farm family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=14038s). Thankfully the day would not end on a sour note, as Bae would request Gonathon’s assistance in her proposal to Immerkind.

No longer able to continue passively watching, Gonathon’s fellow knight Elizabeth called Gonathon, stating that she wished to speak in private. Despite having not interacted much with Liz in the current Libestal, this conversation would prove to have an immense impact on both of them.\n\nCalling Gonathon to her home, the two at first attempted to have a conversation in [the Jade Forge’s basement](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=9708), but upon being stalked by interlopers, Liz led Gonathon through a secret passage. There in private, Liz scolded Gonathon for associating and giving money to [witches](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=9885), despite her own obvious affinity for one. This teasing soon led to a warm exchange, with Gonathon regaling Liz with the adventures of the Wolf Pack and Liz giving Gonathon some wise words on the nature of love and duty.\n\n[What are you fighting for?](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10749)\n\nLiz and Gonathon realized that they shared an intense bond, even if they did not know exactly what it was, and agreed that they shared a fellow kinship with Roa and Immerkind. Determined to uphold their knightly honor and do what was right for their friends and the people, the two promised to uphold their vow as [the Knights of Justice](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10950) and fight together for what they believed in. Sharing a bro hug, the two parted ways, their determination to fight for their code and beliefs burning brighter than ever before.\n\n[For Justice!](#embed:https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11090)\n\nWhile this was the end of Gonathon’s interactions with Liz for the day, it was not the end of the advice he would receive. A [strange, floating cape](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11687) would appear before Gonathon and lecture the Humble Knight on whether he was making the right choices. This exchange further hardened Gonathon’s resolve, and with his knightly code firmly engraved on his heart once more, he set out to make things to right.",

Still following the 15 agents of drama, scams, and emotional damage?\n\nApparently so. But hey, even the wildest horses need to catch their breath sometimes. Or at least, that’s what it _seemed_ like on the surface.\n\nDay six didn’t begin with a brand-new dungeon, unlike the ones before it. Instead, the heroes were offered something different: a special quest. A _ritual_. Or simply put—a game. A test of wits, trust, and lie detection. Everything they had previously used to stir up trouble, now turned toward a challenge of intellect and teamwork.\n\nUpon clearing the ritual, the heroes were rewarded with a mysterious book: **“The Truth of Ruin.”** Within it, scattered fragments of knowledge—clues about the evil that rampaged the world—began to take form. The deeper truths of the world they found themselves in… slowly began to reveal themselves.\n\n![The heroes attempting The Ritual](/images-opt/ritual.webp)\n\nNow normally, this is the part where the summary descends into chaos. But today? Things remained oddly... tame. Well, tame _by Libestal standards_, which still includes:\n\n- Roa taking Elizabeth on a “date,” only for it to be constantly interrupted by Elizabeth’s ex-daughter.\n- Immergood confesses her feelings to the Princess she’s been low-key obsessed with for a while now. Sweet, fluffy, even emotional.\n\nIt was all cute. All calm. A bit _too_ calm.\n\nThis felt like the “calm before the storm.” Tiny ripples of tension hinted at the greater waves to come. A tense conversation between Elizabeth and Shiori sowed the seeds for something heavier. Shiori quietly sets the stage for what could become the climax of her entanglement with Gonathon. The chessboard was being set.\n\n![Shiori's message for Gonathon](/images-opt/to-gonathon.webp)\n\nBut on the lighter, wholesome side—Fuwawa’s café finally got some visitors! Yay for the fluffy cook and her dream slowly coming true.\n\nBrace yourself, though. This silence? It won’t last.",

Maybe, just maybe, her dream would never come true.\n\nBut then, Shiori called.\n\nShe wanted a catering commission—for a picnic party, no less. Fuwawa, of course, would’ve loved to say yes right away, but doubt crept in. Was she even good enough? Could she really handle it? That was when Shiori hit her with the most unexpected news.\n\n[BAU BAU?! BAU BAU!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=0iZ1c9GCaj656Svv&t=546)\n\nEverything in her store had sold out.\n\nFuwawa was stunned. Absolutely stunlocked. Surely it was some sort of mistake? But as she scrambled to check the receipts, it was real. Real purchases, real customers—from all kinds of faces, friends and strangers alike. That disbelief melted into joy, a joy so overwhelming it felt like getting hit with a sugar rush. Her efforts, her patience, her heart—it had all paid off.\n\nWith her heart soaring, she happily [accepted](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=vtoeq8O8RAHIIn9a&t=887) Shiori’s commission and immediately set out gathering the best ingredients she could find. This would be the biggest moment in her café’s history.\n\nThe day kept its joyful tone. She joined her friends for [dungeon runs](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=6WRoJPkQV_34PHWe&t=3259), played a wild [mystery game](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=yz34Cw6rxpyzXVRi&t=6291) where everyone got hilariously heated, and despite being [knocked around](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=lhXHVG9PyhL9_hd_&t=5287) by the Outlander at first, she stood back up with encouragement from her friends and overcame the challenge.\n\n[I did it! Bau bau!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=J7AgJaCwtGngdO_V&t=8749)\n\nHer café? More alive than ever. [Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=2g7ner4_pbuOL_J3&t=1272) came by. [Roa](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=NIle8EZXYAiU15j8&t=9888) too. People stopped in, tasted her food, and their reactions? Pure awe. They smiled—but none as brightly as Fuwawa. She had done it. She had made others happy with her cooking. Her dream had become real.\n\nNow, a new goal stood before her: make the upcoming picnic party the best it could possibly be. Saying she wasn’t nervous would be a lie—it was a huge job, and the thought of the store going empty again did haunt her. But those fears could wait. What mattered now was holding onto this moment, this happiness, and doing everything she could to make sure it lasted forever.\n\n[Today was a happy day](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=38SXUkohf-G30Q0v&t=12153)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"Libestal's Young Chef (Part 2)\" by Dreamplanes](https://x.com/Dreamplanes256/status/1922931113174917132)\n\n[\"the fluffy ones journey\" by Tai](https://x.com/tchailune/status/1921440727466217479)",

Then, Mococo ventured to the Jade Forge, where she met her sister—[who had just now learned of her birthday](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=677)—and had given her more stones as a gift for her wonderful sister.\r\n\r\nBack in _Gacharms_, Mococo decided she would take over the store for a short while.\r\n\r\nLater on, Bijou pulls Mococo aside to give her a salary for helping the business. The money-hungry dog grew sporadic once her fellow jeweler finally bestowed her _2250 coin_ profit share from their business. That's [BIG MONEY!](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=1392s)\r\n\r\nShe used this golden opportunity to advertise to Bijou her (un)professional mental health services for the low, low cost of 100 coins!

Her usual morning routine of writing in her journal left an entire section dedicated [to Juliet, signed by Romeo](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=7SOCL_EVYdha0nu6&t=270). Elizabeth felt bound by duty, memory, and expectation, leaving her envying Nerissa's freedom or perhaps admiring it.\n\n[Read \"From Romeo\"](#text:from-romeo)\n\nWith more gifts from anonymous donors, Elizabeth realizes it's time to expand the LOO and move its location from indoors to around the backside, making it easier to access the basement from behind the Jade Forge.\n\nAfter a mighty fight with the ping ghost, Elizabeth returns home to hear [ominous noises](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=xi3bxaGJIB71yY1m&t=11566) from somewhere nearby. As a Jade Sword Knight, she takes it upon herself to investigate where the loud music comes from. Unable to find the source with the music stopped, she put a pin in this concern to handle later.\n\nWithout a second thought, she finally purchased the [gorgeous ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=12995s). And soon after, encounters Shiori. After a brief discussion about [self-insects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=13650s), Elizabeth crafts a loving letter meant for... Shiori. After quickly gifting this witch a rose and a CD in return for her kindness, Elizabeth rescinds her request for memories of Nerissa to respect her privacy. And doesn't hand over the letter.\n\nCalling upon Roa for an earlier request to upgrade her weapon, Elizabeth sets out to show her where to obtain the items. After a traumatic fall off the edge of a mountain, Roa and Elizabeth find themselves [stuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=16810s). A quick call to Nerissa has Roa on the defensive, saying there was no need, but Elizabeth does so anyway. After Bloodfumble returns with poor phrasing, Bijou joins them, and the call ends.\n\nAgainst her wishes, Elizabeth has no choice but to use magic to escape to safety.\n\nSoon after, the event begins with a letter from the Princess herself. Everyone is to perform a ritual to clear a mysterious and cursed tome. Without a second thought, Elizabeth teams up with Nerissa, Gonathon, and Mococo. The group successfully clears it in two tries, and concern arises for her sister Mococo, who was double-cursed during the ritual.\n\nAfter reading the book in the Library, Elizabeth finally talks to Nerissa, requesting they spar again. After a short talk with Gonathon, she makes it up to the sparring area after walking the entire way again like a true and proper knight.\n\nWith a 2-0 fight in Liz's favor, Nerissa has one last chance to win and claim the prize. Without being nicked even once, the Witch wins the battle and passes her the [ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=20317s).\n\nBack at the Jade Forge once again, the ominous music returned. After a quick call agreeing to make some frames for Shiori, Elizabeth quickly calls fellow knight Gonathon for aid in finding the source of this music. Roa also joins the three of them in beginning the search for the source of this music.\n\nThe trapdoor in front of Nerissa's shop is discovered. Descending from above, they find the painting of Nerissa on full display down below. A quick deduction finds they can [walk through](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=TBhhbOiLoWd3Pp5n&t=21702) and find a chest with a rose inside and four books.\n\nRoa has a fit about the books, not wanting Liz to read them before taking off, upset and leaving Elizabeth and Gonathon to inquire about the readings. Finding the music too loud, the two of them go upstairs to read the stories before them.\n\nConcern rises within Elizabeth as she reads on. Once she encountered the Witch, she quickly asks Nerissa if she's okay. Questions lead to no one knowing how the painting got down below the ground, which leads to Elizabeth requesting that Nerissa stay the night in her LOO for safety.\n\nAfter a brief break, Nerissa again approaches Elizabeth about reading The Cell by Shiori (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\n\nConcern rises within the knight, with the worries on her mind, Elizabeth hunts down Shiori, calling her stories scams and lies. However, Shiori asks her an unexpected question (see [Elizabeth-Shiori](#edge:liz-shiori)).\n\nWith the question ringing in her mind, Elizabeth returns to her room and scraps the initial letter meant for Shiori, instead writing a letter to Mococo before tucking away for the night.",

            "content": "It was a sleepy start for Roa's day as she pondered what to do. Her beloved shop, The Gacharms, was doing well with little for her to do. Perhaps today she should focus on something else... or someone else.\r\n\r\nWith that person in mind, Roa [called her Red Knight](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=748) and, needing more upgrade stones, offered to accompany Elizabeth to the Remnant fields to mine Enigmatic Stones, which Elizabeth agreed to, suggesting they meet by the wagon.\r\n\r\nAs Roa waited, giddy to see Elizabeth once again, she came across Fuwawa and was shocked to hear that Fuwawa had never bought a charm before. As a businesswoman, Roa found it would be a travesty to let a customer get away; she quickly brought Fuwawa to The Gacharms Shop, explaining the mechanics of the gacha system, which ended with [Fuwawa winning splendid prizes](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=978).\r\n\r\nSoon enough, Elizabeth called to meet her by the wagon to start their, in Roa's eyes, date. (See [Roa-Elizabeth: Roa's Not-Beach Day Episode!](#edge:raora-liz))\r\n\r\nRoa would then meet Bijou to ask about their inventory; perhaps there was something suitable there for Elizabeth. But the gifts would have to wait, as the job must be done first: to purify the tome. They all met in the assembly hall to begin their quest.\r\n\r\nTogether with Ina, Bijou, and Bae, Roa had to play a strange game to find who was cursed by the tome. It was confusing, as the cursed one would shift after each round, and their answers would sometimes be too close to tell who would try to foil their attempts.\r\n\r\nThe curse would shift from Bae to Roa to Bijou until it was purified bit by bit, leaving a book that may be able to answer some of their questions. But [concern lingered](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=5760) about the possibility that the curse may have stayed with someone, but it was a concern thankfully unfounded. In the Library, they uncover [The Truth of Ruin](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=5936). The source of Ruination and Stains may not be from Libestal but elsewhere...\r\n\r\nBut none of it concerned Roa in the slightest—her mind was occupied with other thoughts. Throughout her date with Elizabeth, one woman—despite not even being present that day—kept slipping into the romantic air between her and the Scalet Knight: _Nerissa_.\r\n\r\nSo what if Nerissa may have already caught Elizabeth's eye? So what if the Raven had magic and Roa didn't have magic? She's the owner of a successful business; if she can put her mind to gathering a large profit, then she can win Elizabeth's heart. Back in the fields, she fought once again until [the money, then the ring, was hers.](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=9770)\r\n\r\nSeeing Bijou once again, Roa took her aside and told her and Shiori how her day went. That's when [Shiori had a suggestion](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10994):\r\nTell Elizabeth little stories of Nerissa? That might jog Elizabeth's memory... The topic was immediately dropped when Immerkind and Gonathon passed by. Someone then immediately suggested using the Constipation Party area to propose to Elizabeth. Bijou includes blue and pink floating lanterns to set the mood.\r\n\r\nA plan was secured for tomorrow. Roa would soon write in her diary, the excitement flowing through her quill.\r\n\r\n[Hello Pandora](#embed:https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=11534)\r\n\r\nNerissa passed by, and they exchanged pleasantries. Whether Nerissa knew that Roa had foiled her plans to make Elizabeth her own couldn't be known, but the two remained cordial as they parted ways.",

            "content": "_The Great Tam Gander... Rotary blades spinning..._\r\n\r\nAnother day, another set of commissions Shiori was hired to write. Stories with details down to a tee. And unlike Shiori's stories, today seemed limitless in its subplots, such as witnessing the Red Knight's and the Fuzzy One's tender moment of sister-like companionship, [Elizabeth's kindness towards Shiori](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1734) (in return for [Shiori's generosity](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=677)), and recruiting Fuwawa's services for a special event—the Hot Pink One's pregnancy announcement. Of course, the goddess will be shouldering the costs; it is _her_ party.\r\n\r\nSoon, the queenly commission was done; a touch of mossy cobblestone on the parchment was all that was left, and all that was left was to deliver the story.\r\n\r\n[Read \"Tam x Tam\"](#text:tam-x-tam)\r\n\r\nBut there were more commissions to finish stories and—[memories](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1098). Shiori wrote and wrote, putting down the memories only she, as the Archiver, could know. Details that her customers appreciated, as their true memories were also woven into some of the stories requested. Memories are precious things, and like precious things, they come at a price. Soon, the memory was finished and delivered to the Raven One. Now, another... [but at a more appropriate place](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1667).\r\n\r\n[Read \"Blooraven Smut\"](#text:bloodraven-smut)\r\n\r\n[Read \"The Princess #2\"](#text:the-princess-2)\r\n\r\n[Another gift soon made its way to her](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1734) from Elizabeth to thank Shiori for her kindness. The two talked, and Shiori was pleased to see the stories she wrote for Elizabeth were displayed, although Elizabeth decided to cancel her memory commission of Ravencroft, to which Shiori easily agreed. The two would share a warm conversation before they parted ways. [It seems Shiori's plan is working today](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=2541).\r\n\r\nShiori later met Ina and Roa in the Quest Hall and immediately invited them to the HPO's party, letting them know it was for a gender reveal, though she [conveniently left out whose](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=4265). With Ina and Gonathon, they left for the Remnant fields to gather some of the Enigmatic Stones; despite their awkward relationship gone wrong, the Good Knight still protected her from the Stains.\r\n\r\nSoon, it was time for her to meet the other heroes to purify a cursed tome. With Queen Tam, Cecilia, and Fuwawa, they began their efforts. Cursed books are tricky; something lingered within their parchments that refused to leave. But slowly and surely, the curse was slowly lifted, revealing The Truth Of Ruin. With some time to spare, Shiori invited Queen Tam to the party with the Queen's mixed feelings. A Constipation Party.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the construction boxes from Bijou, Shiori would set out to [start preparing the venue](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=7878) for tomorrow, inviting more along the way and letting them know it is now a party for Constipation. Others would also later join her efforts to spruce the place up, including Gonathon who, to Shiori's frustration, would unnecessarily donate 19 construction boxes to help with the party preparations, sharing his unneeded and unasked generosity once again. Shiori would compensate him for [his good deed](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=8274).\r\n\r\nBut, soon after, Shiori was confronted by a certain red knight.\r\n\r\nIt seemed not everyone enjoyed the stories Shiori wrote (see [Elizabeth-Shiori](#edge:liz-shiori)).\r\n\r\nHer attention went back to the party until Roa showed Bijou the ring she bought for Elizabeth. Knowing how Elizabeth's relationship with Nerissa was tense at the moment, Shiori quickly suggested to Roa that this was her opportunity. Shiori spied on Roa's attempt to confess, but ultimately, today wasn't Roa's day.\r\n\r\nIt was an admittedly slow day, Shiori wrote in her diary. Even after getting Queen Tam's prize, her fifth attempt at luck was a rather easy endeavor. Even teasing Cecilia about her love for Iphania—suggesting that perhaps Fia was another version of Iphania, and Cecilia could visit her more.\r\n\r\nHowever. The day would end differently than Shiori thought.\r\n\r\nThere was an important matter she had to talk to Gonathon about but her efforts were impeded by Queen Tam. It was frustrating to see Gonathon stay silent while Tam spoke for him, unwilling to speak his own thoughts. Seeing that, Shiori, along with Bijou, left, but he soon followed after them. For a moment there was a [pregnancy scare](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16782), but the moment passed.\r\n\r\n[Then... Bijou came to a gassy realization](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16811)\r\n\r\nBijou _had_ been feeling strange today... It seems the brothers may share the party tomorrow.\r\n\r\nFinally, everyone else left, leaving Gonathon and Shiori alone.\r\n\r\n[Pearl](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16935)\r\n\r\nShiori witnessed the past romance between the two. She remembered how much [Gonathon had agonized when Pearl lost her memories of her dear husband](https://youtu.be/i7g-HJMqZ_E?t=6028). The relief when they reunited. Shiori offered Gonathon a snippet of his memory with his pearl. Though at the cost of _Shiori's_ memory of him. A precious memory was a costly one, one that Shiori would bear for the too-good-hearted knight. An offer that Gonathon refused. To have [someone else punished](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17098) for his boon was something Gonathon could not agree to.\r\n\r\nTheir relationship was not perfect. Rather, Shiori thought it was filled with much unkindness from her. But it would be a lie to say just unkindness; many moments were filled with sweetness since Gonathon, for all his naive foolishness, was a knight too good for most. For Shiori. With that in mind, Shiori made him promise to buy a book from her stall the next day (see [Gigi-Shiori](#edge:gigi-shiori)).\r\n\r\nA day that began with peace ended with turmoil. As Shiori waited for her wife to finish writing her diary, Shiori left a letter and roses for [Gonathon to find underneath his tree](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17908). Afterwards, she wrote the book she made [Gonathon promise to buy](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=18081). A book she wrote while Gonathon passed by, ignorant that this would be the final moment between him and the Nyavella who loved him.\r\n\r\nBefore Shiori left to sleep, Queen Tam approached to apologize for interrupting her and Gonathon's talk earlier.\r\n\r\n## Fanart\r\n\r\n[\"just a humble witch\" by Noise](https://x.com/lestkrr/status/1922074979434184946)\r\n\r\n[\"a finger in every pie\" by Elisbian](https://x.com/Elisbian_/status/1932104079939186910)",

Cecilia takes the princess's word as an agreement; however, Gonathon and Princess Bijou tell her the truth, and that leaves her torn (see [Cecilia-Princess](#edge:cecilia-iphania)).\n\nCecilia now faces a critical choice: to stay with the princess or to return to their reality?

She pondered: could she show it to others now, or would it perhaps be better to wait for the right time? Setting that bit of mystery aside, she decided to pursue a different form of mystery by exploring more of the castle. The books she amassed in the previous days were quite intriguing... Journals of The Rider? The Explorer? The Researcher? Books of Prophecy??? There was certainly more to this world outside of collecting Fia’s memories and contributing to the Kingdom's economy. She had yet to connect all the dots, for a few more pieces to the puzzle sat waiting to be discovered.\r\n\r\nIn her search for clues, she found more fascinating stories as she talked with the [villagers](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=1859). She learned of their hopes and dreams, their sorrows, and their regrets as they stood waiting for their impending doom.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, she also found children playing [hide-and-seek](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=1941)... as if there was nothing to worry about, they ran and hide, as free as birds flying in the sky.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Princess’ Chambers**\r\n\r\nAs she continued with her search, Nerissa stumbled upon [the Princess’ chambers](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=2162). There was a guard on duty in front of the door, and while he would say clear as day that nobody could enter the room on his watch, he didn’t make any effort to stop the Maiden from barging in.\r\n\r\nShe looked and looked and to her surprise, she found letters in the drawers. From whom could they be? Growing curious, she invited herself to skim their contents... Love letters? From Cecilia Immerkind?!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Six Feet Under**\r\n\r\nThe signs might not have been obvious earlier, but there had certainly been a change in the demeanor of the once-sweet Maiden. Throughout today, instead of focusing on her food business or just providing food in general out of the kindness of her heart, she toiled underground, creating space to store a [strange device](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=4262)—an instrument that produced enchanting, hypnotic music.\r\n\r\nIt was quite the effort, as she needed to consult several spirits/voices and grimoires to craft the device itself.

Instead of worrying about herself, she tried focusing more on helping others.\n\nShe still wanted a little [“pup talk”](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=420) after the madness of the last couple of days, especially yesterday. So she rang up Mococo—she only took appointments by phone.\n\nIt went far better than the service she got from the pink chef the other day. Then again, the bar to surpass that was already so low it was practically level to the floor. She left a glowing review and left the call energized for the day.\n\nShe’ll probably be fine. Just don’t think.\n\n---\n\nBack at Gacharms, Fuwawa seemed to be in the market for charms. Roa started handling it while she was away. Gonathon was even nice enough to give Fuwawa an extra ticket! Bijou enjoyed the business while it lasted; as the end of the world draws near, they may not get many sales in the coming days.\n\nRoa soon tells Bijou she landed a date with the Red Knight, Lady Bloodflame! She asked for her Diamond Pickaxe as they were going material hunting. Bijou felt the urge to eavesdrop again, wondering how her boss did. (See [Raora-Elizabeth: Roa's Not-Beach Day Episode!](#edge:raora-liz))\n\nShe wasn’t too sneaky about this. While pretending to [“do her dailies”](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2122) and “love maps,” she fumbled constantly as she tried to get within earshot. She even [got caught](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2889) a few times while wandering too close to Lady Bloodflame.\n\nRoa and Elizabeth then got [stuck](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2958) on the edge of a cliff near an invisible border. It got worse as soon as Bijou heard the name “Nerissa”...\n\n[LEEEEROY JENKIIIIINS](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=3005)\n\nShe fell into the same exact situation of her boss and the Red Knight. Luckily, she remembered her magic scroll and warped away. She didn’t even think of cleaning up after herself…\n\n---\n\nLater on, Immerkind summons Bijou to the Great Hall. She wants her to act as moral support as she tries to propose to Princess Iphania. Bijou remained supportive of her knight, enabling her pursuit and feeling kind enough to lend her charms for the Outlander fight.\n\nWhile waiting to hear back from her knight, she kept herself company with the voices in her head… and started being a bit of a nuisance.\n\n[“Why is your chest bigger than mine?\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=6576)\n\nWhen Immerkind returned, Bijou let her off on her own devices… but she called back. There was clearly a misunderstanding, and Bijou was the one to clear it up. Indeed, _everyone_ had the same dialogue with the Princess following the Outlander duel. It was a canon event.\n\nImmerkind started to spiral, now with their self-esteem down the drain. Suddenly, Bijou found herself beside Gonathon, acting as moral support while trying to talk sense into the Kind Knight.\n\n---\n\nWith that over with, Bijou checked out how the picnic area Shiori was making for tomorrow’s party of sorts for IRyS. She also picked up the cakes she ordered from Fuwawa, who was to provide catering. Tam provided the big “IT’S GAS” sign floating above.\n\nIt’s probably female gas, Bijou thought. She added pink wool to the back of the letters. Later, she would also have an idea of making floating lanterns around the picnic area, both in pink and light blue.\n\nThe picnic-in-preparation would soon be interrupted by Roa. She wanted to talk to the Red Knight again; she bought the fanciest ring she could buy. She was going to try making a move.\n\nNot just Bijou this time, but Shiori as well wanted to eavesdrop and see how it goes down. Neither of them was normal about this. They both went to the special shop to chug an invisibility potion.\n\nTechnology had not advanced well enough that their cloaks and effects would go invisible when the potion was consumed; only their bodies did. Roa tried covering up for as long as she could until… Bijou’s potion ran out.\n\n[Uncloaked](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=10983)\n\nRoa scolded Bijou for not being discreet about her snooping on her date. Though she didn’t realize that Bijou had been eavesdropping since her date earlier in the mountains. Because of her hard work in the shop, Bijou was forgiven.\n\nNow with Gonathon, Immerkind, the Queen, and Shiori, the five of them were gathered for one last round at Star Site: Chaos; Immerkind had yet to win Bae’s music disc. Luckily, they made quick work of the dungeon, and she got it with a 94% drop rate.\n\n---\n\nLater, Bijou and Shiori had more or less finished decorating the “IT’S GAS” picnic area. She mostly appeared to be spaced out while Shiori took a call with Immerkind, but she did have some things to say anyway.\n\nShe decided to [start writing her journal entry](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=14570). She stopped halfway as Tam and Gonathon [approached](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=15364) the table. Of course, this conversation had to end up being cursed beyond belief.\n\nIt also revealed a _very shocking revelation:_\n\n[“AM I PREGAGANANT?!?!”](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=15785)\n\nSo much for innocence—**Bijou might be pregnant too.** And she literally forgot about the trade she did with Shiori _the other day_.\n\nAfter her heart-to-hearts with Shiori and her stepmom, the Queen, she finally went back to her journal, practically [screaming into it](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=16625) about this realization. She blames the cursed ritual for this; she got cursed twice after all.\n\nShe did one last bit of ~~eavesdropping~~ [map appreciation](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=17101) before turning in for the day.\n\nBijou hopes the picnic preparations won’t go to waste, and she figures it may be best to have the party before they go to the Heart of Ruin tomorrow. Who knows what will happen after they’re done at the final dungeon?\n\nWhatever tomorrow will bring… It’s probably filled with surprises. And maybe gas.",

Learning that several of his companions needed to do the previous day’s dungeon, the Humble Knight wasted no time in volunteering to assist. After a [quick rerun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=1113s) of the dungeon and some farming with Shiori and NinoIna (the latter of whom he engaged in potato touching with), Gonathon found himself at the Mysterious House with many others, all awaiting the announcement of a special event.\n\n[We are stronger together!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=2213s)\n\nWhile waiting for Nerissa to announce the event, Gonathon made small talk with his many companions and, in particular, expressed befuddlement at the concept of a party. Upon Nerissa’s arrival, the knight and the others learned they would be partaking in a strange ritual involving a cursed tome. Although imposing, the [combined expertise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=3914s) of Gonathon, Liz, Nerissa, and Mococo made short work of the ritual. Following rejoicing and a scalp massage for Mococo, Gonathon departed from the group, particularly after witnessing Liz wanting to spend time with Nerissa.\n\nFollowing more perplexing conversations with NinoIna, Gonathon was queried by Shiori about putting together an end-of-the-world party. This topic would be put on hold, for a befuddled Liz (see: [Elizabeth-Gonathon](#edge:liz-gigi)) called on Gonathon for assistance. Liz explained that she had been hearing odd music at her forge, and the ever-inquisitive Gonathon quickly discovered a hidden trapdoor leading to an [odd room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=6694s) decorated with Nerissa’s mural and filled with poems. Leaving Liz to muse on these findings, Gonathon was called upon by yet another companion: the lovesick Immerkind.\n\nImmerkind (see [Cecilia-Gonathon](#edge:cecilia-gigi)), holding back tears, explained to Gonathon that she had made [the decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=7987s) to stay in Libestal with her love, the Princess. Gonathon, stricken with grief, stated he did not want to lose Immerkind, but at the same time concluded that, above all else, he wanted Immerkind to be happy.\n\nAs Immerkind further explained her feelings, Gonathon came to a stark realization: that the words of the princess that Immerkind believed to be only for her were, in fact, ones she uttered to all the adventurers. Reluctant to accept the truth but unable to deny it upon confirming with Bijou, Immerkind once more sought to take her own life but was stopped yet again by Gonathon. He and Bijou begged Immerkind to reconsider, and after managing to talk their friend down, the three shared [a heartfelt talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9264s) about love and the wolf pack.\n\n[I don't want to lose you!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=8933s)\n\nThis sense of calm would not last long, as the Humble Knight once again found himself dealing with a familiar figure: Shiori of the Nyavellas. Talking with Liz, the Scarlet Knight divulged a [contentious conspiracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9461s): that she believed that Shiori was in fact selling false memories to others. Immerkind chimed in to [denounce Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9785s) as well, stating that Gonathon had been framed for her fall two days prior and that the two-toned witch was manipulating the kindhearted knight.\n\nFollowing a sojourn into Star Site: Chaos to assist Tam Gandr in receiving the music disk, Gonathon divulged Liz’s thoughts to the queen and Immerkind. Sandwiched (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Passed Pawn](#edge:kronii-gigi)) between his two closest friends, Gonathon admitted he was unsure if Liz’s words were true, as Liz herself seemed to have skeletons in her closet (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper-Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)). With most of their business done for the day, the three returned to the Library and wrote their journals, and this was seemingly the end of things.\n\n[Gonathon protects the queen from painful memories](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12744s)\n\nInstead, Shiori’s tendrils would pull them back in. First, a seemingly innocent conversation between Shiori and Immerkind on the nature of Fia sparked an [intense, baffling discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=13617s) between Tam, Gonathon, and Immerkind on the nature of the self and love.\n\nNext, Shiori and Bijou pulled the trio into the party site, and seemingly, a new controversy surrounding the potential pregnancies of the witch and gem began to take shape. In a stark twist, this was not why Shiori had called Gonathon there; instead, she had a proposition for the Humble Knight, one that would shake him to his core (see [Gonathon-Shiori: A Memory for a Memory, a Pearl for a Pearl](#edge:gigi-shiori)).\n\nShiori proposed a [simple trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=14956s): she would provide a complete, clear memory of Gonathon’s Pearl so that Gonathon might remember that which he wished more than anything to remember. However, the cost would be steep: Shiori would lose her memories of Gonathon. This time, though, Gonathon would make a choice not for anyone else, but for himself: he did not think it right to rob Shiori of her memories simply for the chance to remember the Pearl.\n\nSeemingly satisfied, Shiori reminisced with Gonathon for a while, with the knight expressing deep regret for not being able to love the witch properly.\n\n[I wish I loved you the way I wanted to.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15325s)\n\nAlthough Tam once more sought to open Gonathon’s eyes to Shiori’s duplicities, Gonathon remained faithful to all his friends. Rather, he felt that a weight had been lifted off his shoulders, and together with the queen, the two mulled over what the next day would bring them as the curtains closed on another day.\n\n[A weight has been lifted](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15822s)",

Well, the Hot Pink One took a rest day and was never seen around the kingdom; she escaped the hands of fate for one day.\n\nRegardless, the impact of IRyS' debacles permeates throughout the kingdom regardless of her physical presence; there's a gender reveal party planned for a mystery newly pregnant individual in Libestal—take a good wild guess who it was for. NinoIna received an invitation through word of mouth, knowing not of its nature, certainly not how close she herself was to the epicenter of it.\n\nThe Hero's appearances in the kingdom were not numerous—having all of her gear upgraded to its best form, she found less need to roam around the Remnants for materials. Nowadays, most of her busywork would be related to her daily tasks, and none beyond. But she would never shy away from the opportunity of being iconic in her interactions.\n\nUpon arriving on time at today's rendezvous point—which was apparently early, because none of the organizers were on location yet—she and the Humble Knight Gonathon with a G just messed around, [engaged in conversation](https://youtu.be/EkwigIYpcdI?t=895s), and entertained each other.

She even stopped for a moment to give tips to Fuwawa, who was struggling with her duel against the Outlander.\n\nIt seemed like a perfect day.\n\nAfter being summoned by Nerissa, Queen Tam and all the heroes went to the Assembly Hall. Everyone present that day exchanged pleasantries—and that’s when the cracks in her seemingly perfect day began to show, at the mention of the Hot Pink One and her “gassy” problem from the previous day.\n\nNerissa read out a letter sent by Princess Iphania regarding an ancient tome that could help the heroes fight the Ruination. However, a certain ritual needed to be performed—one that could even place them under the curse as well.\n\nEven then, Queen Tam had a more troubling matter at hand: Roa Pandora and what had transpired the previous day. The latter was quick to remind her to remember what happened.\n\n[Sassy cat](#embed:https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=670)\n\nQueen Tam proceeded to form a party with Shiori, Immerkind, and Fuwawa—a surprising combination, to say the least—to tackle the [ritual](https://www.youtube.com/live/jayBiB9euJU?si=_OcZUoqnxheMyQ4e&t=953).\n\nThe ritual itself was odd and likely confused most of those involved, including Queen Tam. Either that or she simply couldn’t help but act suspicious (which was ironic, considering that finding the suspicious one was one of the main objectives of the ritual).\n\nHaving finished the ritual without learning much of anything, Queen Tam had a quick conversation with Shiori—who wanted to organize a celebration for the HPO’s constipation upon her return. The Queen begrudgingly agreed and then headed to the main hall to gather materials from the shops.\n\n[Not fertilized, just constipated](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/jayBiB9euJU?si=tksE1UT02lekWEbi&t=2380)\n\nThe Queen was surprisingly willing to help Shiori with the cursed celebration for HPO. At the site of the event was a huge picnic blanket laid out in the field beside Fuwawa’s shop, with an amazing backdrop of Gonathon’s Treehouse. The tree’s owner even dropped by to donate materials for the decorations.\n\nIn an even more surprising turn of [character development](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=3400), the Queen admitted to others—for the first time—that she was poor and actually needed help. It only took two timelines and multiple disasters to bring her to this point.\n\nShiori and Queen Tam began working on the decorations—the former crafting a pretty wooden arch, and the latter creating a bombastic glowing sign that read “ITS GAS,” referring to the supposed “baby” born from HPO. It was a struggle, to say the least. The Queen refused to listen to the voices in her head telling her that her “S” looked like an invented alphabet.\n\nIn the end, everything literally clicked into place, and the Queen stood back to marvel at her handiwork. Of course, how could she err? She’s perfect. “It’s magnificent,” she said. [“This is the most creative I’ve been in my entire life,”](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=4713) she added.\n\nStruck with creative inspiration—and with a generous sprinkling of praise from Shiori—Queen Tam went back to her abode and decided to spruce it up. It did look like a \"truck,\" the voices in her head chimed. She began renovating most of the outer walls and ended up with a decidedly ominous-looking stone house. Queen Tam and the voices in her head were all confused at the outcome, but art is subjective—so who could say she did a bad job?\n\n[“I’m actually happy, not having to interact with people.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=6631)\n\nIndeed, that day was uneventful—at least in comparison with the tumultuous previous days. The voices remarked it was mostly due to the absence of HPO that day.\n\nAfter a brief exchange of howls with her knights, Gonathon and Immerkind, they all decided to tackle the Star Site: Chaos dungeon in order to retrieve the hidden treasure. Of course, this triggered [painful memories](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=7690) from the previous day for the Queen, who had suffered through the same dungeon over and over due to unsuccessful attempts—on top of the heated arguments with the two women she was secretly juggling.\n\nAfter being [sandwiched](https://www.youtube.com/live/jayBiB9euJU?si=4RccvR8LrKblthRi&t=9682) in a closet between Gonathon and Immerkind (yes, quite the jump of events), the Queen listened to her Humble Knight's recent woes. Apparently, Lady Bloodflame told him that Shiori was a scammer who sold memories because she remembered everything about them. Somehow, gossiping about Nerissa and Lady Bloodflame led to the three howling at the moon. No mentions of [maids](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=9901) were made by Immerkind.\n\nGetting ready to conclude the day by writing her journal entry, Queen Tam's entry ended on a happy note, saying she was excited for the next day.\n\nIf only the Queen’s day had ended there, it would have been perfect. However, she deemed it necessary to engage in a cursed conversation with Immerkind and Gonathon regarding the question, “If your lover turned into a cat, would you still love them?” The conversation devolved further, replacing the cat with a [tapeworm](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=11053)—much to the disgust of the voices in her head.\n\nThe day actually ended with a burst of drama under the “ITS GAS” signboard involving Shiori, Gonathon, and Bijou, who innocently asked how babies are born. Queen Tam was so taken aback by the question, the [pause](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=11542) itself was also pregnant.\n\nThe situation grew even more bizarre for the Queen and her Humble Knight when Shiori kept asking him to talk in private. Sensing more heartbreak for the gullible knight, Queen Tam did her best to separate him from Shiori and save him—much like how Gonathon had been there for her the previous day. It was then revealed that, somehow, Shiori was pregnant and that Gonathon wanted to take responsibility for the supposed child. Queen Tam managed to convince Gonathon that handholding does not indeed make babies and that this Shiori was manipulating him like clay in her hands—him and Bijou both. They howled to seal their new understanding.\n\n[I'm too sleepy for this](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/jayBiB9euJU?si=JBsNjpi3chQw5tVT&t=12650)\n\nWith that, the Queen retired for the day and went to her perfect slumber once again.\n\n[\"A peaceful day indeed...\" by seapupu](https://x.com/seapupu290495/status/1920852715703320626)",

She felt ready to go with her shield raised and blade in her hand.\n\nBut two fights left her with losses, and she had only one more chance to claim this unknown prize. Despite Elizabeth’s combat-ready skills as a knight, Nerissa struck her down without so much as a single mark left on the Witch.\n\nWith a laugh and praise, Elizabeth initiated a trade, passing over the [gorgeous ring](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=mzKgTVgZtwUq3Rxv&t=20334) she had purchased earlier in the day. Now, she had a reason to give it along with a few excuses.\n\n---\n\n**A NOBLE KNIGHT'S STAY**\n\nWith victory achieved and a loss gained, there are talks of the Knight’s Suite as a prize for a sparring tournament. The very gift Nerissa secretly gave to Elizabeth. But it becomes painfully evident that Elizabeth has no idea the size of this room or that it’s not a room intended for sparring.\n\nQuickly, they make haste to Mordan Ramsey’s hotel to [inspect the room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=20591s) itself. Elizabeth was disappointed that it’s not what she reasonably expected. However, Nerissa and Elizabeth let their worries go as they embraced their inner child. Both jump on the bed before deciding it's best to stop before they break it.\n\n---\n\n**I'LL PROTECT YOU**\n\nWorry. Concern. Fear.\n\nA painting moved without a reason or an idea of who could have done it.\n\nMysterious music and ticking sounds were heard around the shop.\n\nBooks of confusion, feeling, and poetry are hidden behind Nerissa’s painting.\n\nNone of it sits well with the Jade Knight. Elizabeth turns to Nerissa and requests that she [stay in her LOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=22594s) for this night. Not to be alone.\n\n“Stay safe, okay?”\n\nA simple request for an unknown threat.\n\nOr perhaps the danger is right before the knight—reflected in red eyes and odd intonations\n\n---\n\n**VERUM VOLUMEN**\n\nWhat exactly were their past identities? Their previous relationship? If Elizabeth was so insistent on Nerissa being a witch, was she actually one? Had Nerissa done something evil to the knight so that her hatred transcended along with her in the present?\n\nThe growing curiosity of the black-haired Maiden urged her to consult the memory of the other witch, Shiori of the Nyavella, whom she had commissioned a day ago to write something for her. Whether it was trustworthy or not, it did not matter. She had to cling onto something…\n\nShe promised that she would read it together with the fair knight; however, just to have some form of solace, she’d take a peek. And thus she [read](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=13021)…\n\nThe contents of the scroll told of a tale of a knight and a ravened one; the Knight accusing the Raven Maiden, a witch, of presumably bewitching and casting hexes upon her. The Ravened One denied the allegations, citing she had only been kind to the Rosen Maiden; yet her words had fallen on deaf ears as the knight remained true to her resolve. She locked the witch away… in a cellar, where no one could hear her song apart from another prisoner…\n\nTroubled by such a story, she [called](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=13185) upon Lady Bloodflame, perhaps to inquire if she remembered any of it… if there was any truth to it. The fair knight, having received the call, made haste and read the same words written in the scroll.\n\nConfused, she denied it was factual and accused Shiori of telling lies. Indeed, there was no way she could do such a thing to her, could she? Even Nerissa believed she was a kind knight–a soldier of justice. She would make sure a just and fair trial had been put into place before she could pass judgment, surely?\n\nThe two hoped it was just make-believe... a figment of Shiori of the Nyavella’s imagination.\n\n---\n\n**THE OMEN**\n\nOverall, it had been quite a fun day… as they were able to spend time together and rekindle their relationship. Partly oblivious to the truth, they [slept](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=16262) the night together in Elizabeth’s quarters. The morrow shall be a good one…\n\n…Yet there lay the ominous books behind the portrait of the “witch”... seemingly foreboding of death and loss.\n\nWas it a prophecy? A retelling of the past? Or perhaps mere fiction?

            "content": "While Gonathon and Shiori were now on better footing than a day prior, a haze of tension continued to envelop the witch and knight. As with many of her companions, Gonathon’s first interactions with Shiori involved assisting her with upgrades and preparation, in this case, farming [enigmatic stones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=2465s). Before departing for the Cursed Tome event, Shiori requested Gonathon’s assistance with setting up an End of the World Party, which Gonathon happily agreed to help with.\n\nThe two would part ways for a while, with Shiori working on the party site and Gonathon assisting Immerkind with her romantic woes (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Knight at Home with the Wolves](#edge:cecilia-gigi)). It was during this time that Shiori would be confronted by Elizabeth. The Scarlet Knight had become enraged over the memories Shiori had sold, which she felt were fabricated. Now believing Shiori to be a scammer and manipulator, she becomes the most recent of many friends to warn Gonathon of her intentions. Immerkind, too, pleaded with Gonathon not to trust the witch, proclaiming her to be toxic and using the Humble Knight. Gonathon, not sure what to make of these accusations, explained that she and Shiori were on [neutral terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9716s), but lingering in such a state did not feel right.\n\n[Shiori is wrong about Gonathon pushing her.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9785s)\n\nConflicted over whether to believe her knightly mentor or the recalcitrant witch, Gonathon concluded that Liz deserved to be heard out and relayed her words to Tam Gandr (see: [Gonathon-Kronii: Passed Pawn](#edge:kronii-gigi)) and Immerkind. Unsure of Shiori’s intentions but certain that Liz had no reason to lie, the three agreed to confront the Red Knight and witch. They needn’t wait long to hear Shiori’s side, for the two-toned witch invited the trio to the party site to talk.\n\nWhile the chief concerns of the gathering at first seemed to revolve around Shiori potentially being pregnant with Gonathon’s child following their hand-holding incident, Shiori’s actual reason for calling Gonathon went far deeper than any physical relationship. Pulling Gonathon aside and bathed in the moon’s radiant warmth, Shiori asked Gonathon about her Pearl and offered Gonathon a seemingly [simple choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=14956s): in exchange for a complete and clear snippet of a memory of her Pearl, Shiori’s memory of Gonathon would be wiped away.\n\n[We have gotten lost in each other's kindness](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15052s)\n\nThroughout their encounters, Shiori had time and time again admonished Gonathon for being overly reliant on others, for never making choices for herself, for always needing the approval of others to do anything. But here, with only the witch by her side, Gonathon made a [firm and resolute decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15125s) born of her feelings and beliefs: that it was not right for her to remember the Pearl if it meant forcing Shiori to give up her memories, and that above all else, that she would not want her memories to be returned if others had to pay a price. She went on to apologize to Shiori for not being able to love the witch the way she wanted, and this caused Shiori to take a pause. Having heard Gonathon’s decision, the witch explained that she had [left a gift in her stall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15402s) before departing.\n\nWhile Tam attempted to convince Gonathon of Shiori’s duplicity and manipulation of others, the Humble Knight would not be swayed, and the exhausted queen and kindhearted retainer departed together. Now left alone, Shiori confessed that she had long made up her mind to relinquish her memories of Gonathon, and imparted the Humble Knight with one last message thanking her and requesting that she be true to herself.\n\n[The last rites of the humble witch](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17762)\n\n[Read \"To Gonathon\"](#text:to-gonathon)\n\n[Read \"Your Promise\"](#text:your-promise)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"The Fumble Knight\" by KHOA](https://x.com/KhoaPhan96/status/1920858870433391103)\n\n[\"Losing interest\" by The_DankWave](https://x.com/The_DankWave/status/1920202895640965586)",

The two parted to assist their parties in the Mysterious Tome quest, during which a jovial Tam Gandr proudly proclaimed that Gonathon was [a truly great companion](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=1755) (this was quickly misinterpreted by her party members as Tam praising Gonathon as a good pet).\n\nDestiny would not keep the queen and knight apart for long, as Gonathon once again offered to assist Tam in winning the music disk from Star Site: Chaos. Initially reluctant to attempt the dungeon once more due to past traumatic attempts, Gonathon insisted that things would be different this time. This [promise held true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12168s), as the Humble Knight and the party would easily win the prize the queen had sought.\n\nFrom here, intrigue would once again spark to life as Gonathon, Tam, and Immerkind crammed themselves into a [closet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12291s) to discuss an important matter: that Elizabeth had reason to believe Shiori of the Nyavellas was peddling false memories. By this point, Tam had become deeply protective of her knight and indignant towards Shiori’s apparent manipulations, and she strongly insisted that the trio side with Liz. Gonathon, on the other hand, was not so sure, and finding themselves at an impasse (and following yet another instance of Gonathon seeking to spare Tam further embarrassment caused by the Hot Pink One’s misdeeds), the three retired to write their journals.\n\n[There is no maid](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12744s)\n\nThey were stopped from doing so, however, by the wily Shiori. Her questions concerning Immerkind potentially dating Fia spiraled into a deranged, highly philosophical discussion on one’s state of being, the sense of self, and the meaning of love. When Shiori called upon Gonathon to inspect the party site, Tam was insistent on accompanying her knight. And when Shiori had finished presenting her bargain with Gonathon (see [Gonathon-Shiori: A Memory for a Memory, a Pearl for a Pearl](#edge:gigi-shiori)), Tam confronted her knight once more. Having witnessed the extent of Shiori’s apparent machinations, the queen stated in no uncertain terms [her belief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15572s) that the witch was manipulating and toying with the Kind Knight’s heart, just as she had done with others. Realizing that Gonathon had made up her mind about Shiori, a defeated Tam shared a tender moment with her loyal retainer, expressing a belief that at the very least, they would see the day through together.\n\n[Nothing can ruin this day!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15822s)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"In the closet\" by Edialex](https://x.com/Ediialex/status/1920993972970721626)\n\n[\"the closet\" by BunBBun](https://x.com/BunBBun1/status/1921443699562610732)",

Six days where the glimmer in her eyes had never dulled, not even for a moment. She had given her all—every breath, every thought, every ounce of strength—just for a chance to remain by the Princess's side. She shielded her, fulfilled her wishes, and held steadfast even when the Princess's heart seemed to wander elsewhere, most often toward the Outlander.\n\nBut today… today, emotions could no longer be held back.\n\nInstrument in hand, heart on sleeve, Cecilia chose to bare it all. No more subtle gestures. No more waiting. She poured herself into a song.\n\nA song for her Princess.\nA song from the Knight’s aching heart.\n\n[Oh Princess ♪](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/I75IWfMGVgM?t=7144)\n\nA confession woven not in words alone, but in trembling notes and heartfelt lyrics. The tremor in her voice made every line land deeper. It wasn’t just a song—it was a love letter born of six days of devotion, adoration, and quiet heartbreak.\n\nAnd the Princess responded.\n\nCecilia gasped—perhaps in joy, in disbelief. It was something, wasn't it? The Princess said she saw something _special_ in her. That meant something… right? Surely that wasn’t a phrase she handed out like candy… right?\n\n...Right?\n\nBut the truth hit, slowly at first, then all at once. The response wasn’t what Cecilia had hoped for. It wasn’t rejection, no… but it wasn’t confirmation either. And as doubts began to pool in her heart, it was Bijou and Gonathon who spoke the words she couldn’t bring herself to say. Words that made it clear the Princess hadn’t understood the depth of what Cecilia had offered her.\n\nThat was when the dam broke.\n\n[It's over](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/I75IWfMGVgM?si=u-PlbeDW8LMpZi8Y&t=9163)\n\nTears flowed—not from weakness, but from the raw weight of unreciprocated love.\n\nStill, amidst her sorrow, her friends were there. Bijou, Gonathon—unwavering, grounding her, giving her the strength to rise again. And rise she did (see [Cecilia-Bijou](#edge:cecilia-bijou) and [Gonathon-Cecilia](#edge:cecilia-gigi)).\n\nTwo days remained.\n\nAnd in those two days, Cecilia would wait—for an answer, for hope, for the love she still so desperately wished to be returned.\n\n## Fan Art from Music Video\n\nNote from the Legend of Immerkind Archiver: Thank you so much everyone for all your hard work in creating beautiful fan art for the story Cecilia is telling.

Today would prove to be the first time a chink would appear in her armor in the eyes of the Humble Knight, but would this be enough to foster distrust?\n\nThe two knights ventured into the Mysterious Tome quest together, with their wits and bond allowing them to lead their companions to victory. Walking together following their victory, the two encountered Nerissa Ravencroft, whom Liz desired to spar with. Although the raven witch offered for Gonathon to accompany them, a [feeling deep inside the Humble Knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=4864s) told him it was better to give them some time alone, and he proclaimed he would meet with his fellow knight later.\n\n[A wolf is a good companion!](#embed:http://youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=3914s)\n\nSoon after, Liz would request Gonathon’s aid in an urgent matter. A strange music had been seeping out from underneath her forge, and she was unsure of its origin. The keen-eyed junior knight quickly discovered a secret passage underneath the Jade Forge, one emblazoned with a mural of Nerissa (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)). There, the knights and Roa discovered a chest containing a poem, one that appeared to be significant to the Scarlet Knight. Liz further showed off her [LOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=7601s)—Liz Out of Office—but became defensive when asked why there was only one bed. Leaving Liz to ponder the poem they found, Gonathon was unaware that the next time they would speak would be under very different circumstances.\n\n[Alas, poor Bae, I knew her well, Immerkind](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=6829s)\n\nWhile Gonathon assisted Immerkind with her troubles (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Knight at Home with the Wolves](#edge:cecilia-gigi)), the Scarlet Knight made a disturbing discovery: that Nerissa had been given memories by Shiori of the Nyavellas that appeared to portray Elizabeth jailing the raven witch. Enraged by what she perceived to be a falsified memory, Elizabeth confronted Shiori. Realizing her connection to Gonathon put the Humble Knight in danger, she [called Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9409s) and informed him of Shiori’s deeds.\n\nGonathon now stood very conflicted. On the one hand, she deeply trusted her fellow knight and saw no reason why she would falsely accuse Shiori. But on the other hand, she could not bring herself to suspect Shiori, and could not help but question exactly what Liz was up to and why she only had a single bed for her LOO. Gonathon, Tam Gandr, and Immerkind all agreed to [confront](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12902s) Liz and determine once and for all what motivated the stalwart knight’s heart.\n\n[Immerkind has an... interesting theory](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12645s)",

The day bloomed into something that closely resembled... well, a real date. A soft, gentle, [blushing](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=1970) kind of day—one that felt like it had been plucked straight from a storybook.\n\nA glowing moon lit the field while the stars above glowed with delight.

Roa was admiring when a melody started playing.\n\nThen, there was _that_ moment—tender, quiet—where it seemed like Roa might confess. Her voice nearly cracked under the weight of her heart, but just before the words could leave her lips, she held back. Still, the feeling lingered in the air, unmistakable.\n\n[Nice music, eh?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/E-LGNO7JdO4?si=D4DbO9SIH19UQouG&t=3357)\n\nFor the first time in what felt like forever, the Pink Maiden's heart dared to hope.

Roa would run away in tears, spending her time in the Remnant fields. There, she swore to earn the gold, 5000 coins, to buy a gift for Elizabeth and confess her feelings. It was an endless battle. Stain after Stain, Roa unleashed all her frustrations against those who stood in the way of her love.\n\nBut through her pain and Bijou's busy phone, Roa planned to bring Elizabeth here, to the top of the remnant field, to confess her feelings.\n\nIn another turn of clichéd events, Elizabeth was suddenly nearby. Worried about how Roa had suddenly left, Elizabeth informed Roa that she put back the items in Nerissa's spot, and Roa immediately took the opportunity.\n\n[Charms for Her Red Knight](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/E-LGNO7JdO4?si=wfP3zWSaDRNYPG3F&t=8936)\n\nThree legendary charms for a legendary Knight.

If saving the world and, ultimately, the universe was ever going to happen, it had to be today.\r\n\r\nThis was the day our heroes confronted their ultimate task: to destroy the Heart of Ruin, the very reason they had come to this world. All 15 gathered together, united in purpose, ready to face the so-called final boss... or so they thought.\r\n\r\nThings didn’t go as smoothly. Some fell to curses, turning against their own, forcing the others to bring them back from the brink. Only then did the true antagonist reveal itself—the creeping evil that had long poisoned the land and now threatened to consume all. And even when they triumphed, there lingered an unease, a feeling that this wasn’t truly over. Something still felt... off.\r\n\r\n![The battle against The Curse](/images-opt/curse.webp)\r\n\r\nBut for now, their mission was complete. And so came the time for resolutions.\r\n\r\nBittersweet closure found its way into Gonathon and Shiori’s story. An unexpected wedding tied together a certain cat lady and her feline partner, Shakira and Roa. A surprisingly heartfelt display of brotherhood emerged between Gonathon and Peasant Bae. Even Elizabeth and Nerissa, for once, shared something more than a witch-themed bickering exchange. Progress—real progress—was made, all rooted in one thing: bonds, connection, and reconciliation.\r\n\r\n...Well, almost all.\r\n\r\nOne storyline stood defiant in its absurdity.\r\n\r\nIn a day full of meaningful moments, a gender reveal party somehow stole the show in the most chaotic way possible. Yes, Miss Hot Pink One struck again—introducing yet more insanity to the kingdom with her ambiguous stomach situation. While others were weaving connections and building bridges, she was... doing the exact opposite. Her logic remained a mystery, one that seemed less like a riddle and more like a dare to comprehend.\r\n\r\n![The Pink One's ~~gas~~ gender reveal party](/images-opt/gender.webp)\r\n\r\nStill, one day remains.

She foraged, harvested, and cooked up chicken, cakes, salads—every kind of cuisine she could think of.\n\nBut before the event, there was one last thing she had to do: finish the final dungeon, the whole [\"saving the world\"](https://www.youtube.com/live/eKVBp9EgDLc?t=5273) ordeal. So she joined the remaining heroes, got possessed and fought her comrades, got saved, fought the final boss, and helped save the world. You know, the minor stuff. She promptly left to get back to her real priority—finishing her preparations.\n\nFuwawa had come a long way since the early days of dreaming about a humble stall where her food could make people smile. She had faced moments of doubt, times when she felt like giving up, but she stayed strong. Her perseverance paid off—from one customer to many, from earning nothing to raking in thousands of coins. None of it would’ve been possible without her dedication—and the friends who stood by her in her darkest times. She felt deeply grateful to them.\n\n[A letter of appreciation](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/eKVBp9EgDLc?t=8320)\n\nThe party began. Fuwawa brought all the food she’d prepared—an impressive spread. It was... definitely a [strange party](https://www.youtube.com/live/eKVBp9EgDLc?t=8786), to say the least. Fuwawa didn’t quite understand most of what was going on, but what really mattered to her was whether people enjoyed her cooking.\n\n[Food!

Everyone loved it.\n\nFuwawa was happy. It was a special day, and she wouldn’t trade it for the world.\n\n[Today was a special day](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/eKVBp9EgDLc?t=9576)",

She’d been feeling a little unwell the day before, but somehow, resting hadn’t done much. If anything, it made things worse. Dizzy, nauseated, and unsure of what was happening, she confided in Roa, who offered her a bed and some [comforting words](https://www.youtube.com/live/AxQVdUrmVZU?si=yPqtSKek3669499D&t=875).

She had to join the others for the final dungeon, and of course, the party they were all invited to—even if she still had no clue what it was actually for.\n\nShe gathered at the dungeon’s entrance with the rest of the heroes, but the moment they stepped inside, something snapped.\n\n[Feral Bau Baus](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/AxQVdUrmVZU?si=--yBq_oBXFgsl_MT&t=5272)\n\nMococo, along with four others, was cursed—forced to turn against her comrades. Thankfully, they managed to snap out of it with the help of everyone else. Together, they destroyed the Curse, saved the world... and oddly enough, Mococo didn’t feel sick anymore. Strange, but hey, she was feeling great now.\n\nRefreshed and riding high on post-victory adrenaline, she went ahead and challenged everyone to duels. Because why not? Unfortunately, while her mouth talked a big game, her body couldn’t quite keep up—she challenged two people and lost [both matches](https://www.youtube.com/live/AxQVdUrmVZU?si=brpDCiHHjSM7FCf5&t=7451).\n\nSo now she was left with all this pent-up frustration from losing back-to-back... she had to release it _somehow_. Oh? The Hot Pink One’s throwing a party? Perfect. And she has a child now?\n\nExcellent. A perfect target for her claws to unleash fury upon, just like old times.\n\n[Say your last prayers, chicken.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/AxQVdUrmVZU?si=S5vlYTWNDv68hc5A&t=8949)\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"CONGRATS!

            "content": "**Are You Okay?**\r\n\r\nAnother day, another journal. Elizabeth is worried about keeping _someone_ safe. Yet when she looks at Thorn and strikes at the enemy, it cuts differently now. Flashes of ink splashed across a page seared into her memory. Thoughts of accosting someone without cause, without jury, without... justice.\r\n\r\n**_Which home do you want to go back to?_**\r\n\r\nElizabeth's morning is interrupted by ominous music, prompting concern for her sister Mococo and the kitty Roa.\r\n\r\nThat entices her to pull her phone out and call Roa, asking if she was okay due to how upset she seemed yesterday. It doesn't take much for concern to take over when Roa states she feels ill and her stomach is still upset from being cursed. Swiftly, Elizabeth buys Roa some costly treats.\r\n\r\nAs the two chat, Nerissa shows up, causing the fur on Roa's tail to stand up. Bloodfumble makes herself known again when Nerissa admits that she [stayed the night](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=854) in Lady Bloodflame's room. Offering the same to Roa with Nerissa in the room only infuriates and frustrates Roa and causes her to run off.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why Roa doesn't trust Rissa.\"\r\n\r\nOnce again, that damned ominous music returns. Nerissa had said she was fine, Elizabeth mumbled to herself (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Forget or Forgive](#edge:liz-nerissa)). Still, she worries and rushes next door, calling for Nerissa multiple times before breaking down the door.\r\n\r\nIt's her _duty_ to protect. She needs to know that the Witch is safe!\r\n\r\nInside a trapdoor tucked in the corner draws her eye. Scared of what lies beneath, she descends quickly through tight halls—until she's face-to-face with the truth.\r\n\r\n[A jukebox.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=2065)\r\n\r\n**_A trick._**\r\n\r\n\"Being played a fool. What a foolish knight I am.\" Elizabeth whispers.\r\n\r\n\"She was low the other day and was just playing a trick on me to make me feel better,\" Elizabeth lies. \"I will see the brighter side.\"\r\n\r\nEven so, she worries. _Is Ravencroft okay?_\r\n\r\nRoa reappears, her disdain for the Witch clear. Despite the trickery, Elizabeth defends Nerissa, warning Roa that Shiori is the danger. The story given to Nerissa painted Elizabeth as cold, callous—unworthy of a knight.\r\n\r\n**_F̵o̵r̸ ̷J̸u̸s̶t̴i̷c̵e̶-̴_**\r\n\r\nShaking her head, Elizabeth returns to the forge. She briefly greets the Mighty Phoenix and reminds herself to gift her flowers. In the basement, she confronts framed memories of the unknown.\r\n\r\nShe gathers materials and builds a fire. Holding the memories, Elizabeth scoffs and [casts them into the flames](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=5712).\r\n\r\n**_O̴̠͋h̶͇͂,̴͙̕ ̵͚͋t̴̠́h̷̄ͅè̴̟ ̵̢̈́m̸̫̄ẽ̵̟m̷̟͒o̷̥̓r̸̜̓i̸͚͝ȅ̷̤s̴̹̅.̵̝͌ ̴͚̾Ĕ̵̥v̷̟̆ě̶̗ṙ̵̪y̷̤̆ȍ̶͎n̸͇̓e̸͙̋ ̵̠̍ẘ̶͜ǎ̴̦n̶͈̉ţ̵̍s̶̱̏ ̶͕̂ẗ̸͈́o̶̤͑ ̶̼̈́b̶͍͝ę̴̐ ̶̥̓m̷̰̍ỵ̶͐ ̶͌͜ȇ̶̯n̴͕͐e̷̮̔ḿ̶͎ỳ̷̳.̵͓̋_**\r\n\r\n_I won't let these memories hurt Nerissa. These lies and scams._\r\n\r\nShiori tries to approach Elizabeth more than once, but the strong knight ignores her and walks on past without a word. She has to focus on the dungeon—on saving Libestal.\r\n\r\nStepping into the dungeon with everyone else simultaneously to face the final boss together, they instead face something even more terrifying.\r\n\r\nElizabeth must face her friends. Must face... Nerissa.\r\n\r\nWithout warning, Elizabeth loses control of her own body. Nerissa giggles sweetly in her ear.\r\n\r\n['_Hello. Lady Bloodflame._'](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=8923)\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, Nerissa is ejected out of her just as quickly as it happened. The Curse strikes out at them before they even have time to discuss what happens. The group fights valiantly and defeats the creature. To finally defeat this evil that stained the Kingdom of Libestal.\r\n\r\n**_D̵o̴ ̶y̵o̷u̴ ̷w̴a̶n̴t̸ ̶t̷o̶ ̸g̴o̴ ̶b̶a̵c̴k̷?̸_**\r\n\r\nOnce free, she spots Roa with Shiori again and approaches, warning her about the evil Witch. Again, she is questioned about which one is truly the evil one: Shiori or Nerissa?\r\n\r\nYet despite that question, she asks Nerissa if she's okay after the dungeon. Again, she's asking Nerissa if she's OK. Is it the third time today? The fourth?\r\n\r\nA stop in the castle has her [staring at the paintings again](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=10221). Shiori. Nerissa. Bijou. Fuwawa. Mococo. Why are their photos together?\r\n\r\n**_Ⱨ₳Ɽ฿ł₦₲ɆⱤ Ø₣-_**\r\n\r\nElizabeth prepares fireworks for the party; [Nerissa steps in](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=10432) to visit her and chat.\r\n\r\nElizabeth makes red fireworks for herslef and blue ones for Nerissa.. After a failed test, Nerissa makes a suggestion.\r\n\r\nA trip together to the onsen.\r\n\r\nYet again, Roa shows up, and Elizabeth Bloodfumble returns full force. Nerissa walks off as Elizabeth offers to have all three attend the onsen together. Something Nerissa or Roa seems too keen on. Somewhere along the way, she loses Roa and searches for Nerissa, finding the onsen she wasn't aware of.\r\n\r\nWith the other already in the steamy and hot water, Elizabeth undresses and removes her helmet as she climbs into the opposite side, unaware of wandering eyes inside and outside the onsen.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, the two quickly make their way to the event of the day.\r\n\r\nWith the... Gas party underway, Elizabeth finds herself at Nerissa's side throughout the entire thing. Even sharing a picnic.\r\n\r\nWalking back to the forge after the party, she takes a moment to [stare at the burning memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=13731). Once again, she finds herself face-to-face with Nerissa.\r\n\r\n[\"You're also pretty too.\"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?si=038e-vGsvZvwxgJe&t=13938)\r\n\r\nIt comes out vocally this time. It's not a thought inside Elizabeth’s head—an admission of something.\r\n\r\n**_A͓͓̽̽r͓͓̽̽e͓̽ ͓̽Y͓͓̽̽o͓͓̽̽u͓̽ ͓̽O͓͓̽̽k͓̽a͓͓̽̽y͓̽?_**\r\n\r\nAgain, the question spills from her lips.

Nevertheless, this powerful phoenix was keen on catching up. Shakira quickly got in touch with Immerkind, who updated the Lorekeeper on the status of her connection with the princess.\n\nLiz's sugar mommy was in for a surprise. Liz led Shakira into a fragrant room brimming with roses. Of course, _it was all platonic for her._\n\n[Counted all 31 roses in German!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=WEPtJx1R5jje3zOQ&t=5400)\n\nWhat did all these roses imply, one might wonder? Love? Marriage? If so, they certainly weren’t pointing toward anything between Shakira and Elizabeth. Instead, they seemed to hint at something far more unexpected—something blossoming between her and a certain other lady. Someone she hadn’t really interacted with much, yet still adored deeply. Why? Because she was a cat, of course.\n\nRegardless, things were looking bright for Shakira. She’d helped Fuwawa with her cozy little café—something the fluffy one was [immensely grateful](https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=vEe1MwWo-G92o61N&t=7708) for. She’d helped [save the world](https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=k8ITOhctAgqchF4l&t=9334), just as they were all tasked to do. And this time, she’d been more involved in everyone’s chaotic antics. Compared to her previous journey, this one had gone surprisingly smoothly.\n\n[The gassy party](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=kvQVbcOUu1hlwAx6&t=12015)\n\nWith the fate of the world now settled, it was time for Shakira to seal her own future. Those roses from before? The gassy party? If romance were ever going to bloom for her, it would be now.\n\nShe met with Roa—a pink cat—and after a heartfelt exchange, the two tied the knot (see [Shakira-Roa](#edge:raora-kiara)).\n\nLater, she journaled the day’s whirlwind of events, right before the final day arrived.\n\n[Liebes Tagebuch!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=SDhiMcfQ4LxQdVG1&t=15145)",

            "content": "There was a sense of finality in the air. The last fight that would decide Libestal's fate was near... and soon, Bae's confession. Death or life, love or rejection; it all weighed heavily on Bae's heart.\r\n\r\nAnd a few things to finish, such as [Khaos and The Other One's room.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=489). A few decorations that could be won from the gacha would suit the children's room nicely.\r\n\r\nBae was elated and nervous as she and [Cecilia spoke](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=323). So much to say in so little time, but they promised to watch each other's back in this final endeavour. Bae tried to hint her romantic intentions, a hint that gracefully went over Cecilia's head. Doubt rised within Bae, can she really win the heart of one Miss Immerkind? Mother, whoever Mother was, said \"With love comes heartbreak.\" Was it worth it to pursue a fruitless feat? [Voices in her head spoke](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=783): Yes, closure.\r\n\r\nBolstered by the voices, Bae called Gonathon to talk about their plan, refining the details to a tee. When Bae is ready, she would send a signal to Gonathon via phone, then Gonathon would bring Cecilia by the bridge in the first Remnant Field. But as [Bae waited for Time to arrive](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=1962), doubt lingered to which Gonathon, a true comrade and friend, reassured her that all will be fine, later mentioning the jest that Iphania was Fia (a joke Cecilia heard from Shiori) would help Bae's chances. But, as Bae checked her inventory, her letter was _gone_... [and tucked in a safe place,](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2645) back in one of the chests at home. After keeping the letter within her person, Bae showed Gonathon him the children's soon-to-be room. It was still a work in progress, a literal hole in the wall, but Bae would see it finished the journey ends.\r\n\r\nA sense of excitement filled the air as they wait for Queen Tam to arrive; [Bae watched](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2160) as Mordan announced her auction while the Hot Pink One and a few others nearby were quite ill. At the corner of her eye, Immerkind was nearby. And the Hero, Ina. Bae, inspired by the gallant way Ina had fought in the Illusory Libestal, promised to do her part. Flattered, Ina agreed, after all, Bae was also fighting for those she cherish. Bae _is_ a Hero worth her salt.\r\n\r\nBut, it seemed a certain pink one might have something _more_ than constipation. Words such as \"raise,\" \"sickness,\" and \"life-altering changes\" reached Bae's ears. The pieces connected... _IRyS_ was **pregnant**.\r\n\r\n[Then Gonathon Raised Another Concern](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2782)\r\n\r\nBae paused. _Is_ there anyone in the kingdom qualified to help with childbi-\r\n\r\nThe thought discarded by Queen Tammy's _timely_ arrival!\r\n\r\nRuination was at their doorsteps and the heroes took charge. A sense of trepidation filled Bae as laughter filled the dungeon's library. A strange glow surrounded Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori as they flew in the air. The curse from yesterday lingered as an **Advent** of darkness was upon them. But it seems the purification was simple enough, defeating the Stains that littered the dungeon seemed to help. Bae faced [their attacks](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=3445) best she could, eventually her friends were rescused.\r\n\r\n[The Curse](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=3693)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the fiercest opponent Bae had faced, but not one she couldn't defeat, especially with the combined efforts of all our heroes. Soon, [Libestal was free from Ruin.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4009) And a [small doll too](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4051), one that looked remarkably like Fia. Bae watched teary eyed as Iphania took Fia into her arms. The last gift the princess gave to her father had finally returned to her.\r\n\r\nOne last challenge was left before Bae's day was over. Love (see [Bae-Cecilia](#edge:cecilia-bae)).\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nShe was rejected.\r\n\r\nSwiftly, Gonathon was by Bae's side, a witness to her heartbreak (see [Bae-Gigi](#edge:bae-gigi)).\r\n\r\nWith love, and Cecilia, behind her, Bae witnessed the... party. Slightly awkward as others may have known about her recent plight, Bae reassured all that she was fine, even introducing IRyS to her [abandoned nephew.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5633) Soon the party started and, tradition at this point, drama ensued. Queen Tammy [rejecting the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5761), Gonathon jumping at his Queen's defence.\r\n\r\n[... Who was going to deliver the child?](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5883)\r\n\r\nIgnoring _that_, [Bae looked for the Queen](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5936), inquiring about the authencity of the rumours. Bae watched reassured as Queen Tam admired herself, it seemed all was fine now and that the Queen would stay in Libestal. Hearing that, Bae couldn't help but feel disappointed, since she would leave to find her Box. Bae left to give them some privacy as Tammy's therapy session would soon begin.\r\n\r\nA series of events quickly followed: a gassy girl born [(the less said, the better)](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=6744) and quickly lost, the Hot Pink One's failing marriage, a duel that resulted in the Hot Pink One's dissection, and ending in [a wonderful wedding](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=7715) between Kiara and Roa.\r\n\r\nFinally, Bae went to finalize the room for her children, Khaos and The Other One. Before long, it was done; it was warm and comfortable with plenty of supplies to keep them fed; [Bae even won 2 figures from the gacha](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=8199) after 36 attempts! Bae commerated this moment with Gonathon and Bijou, fellow State Farmers, proudly showing them her hard work.\r\n\r\n[Kids' Room](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=9402)\r\n\r\nBut alas, with every high in life, there are lows, for [Bae was scammed](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=10289), and her endeavours in [fireworks did not spark colour in her life](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=11047).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the morrow would be a more joyous occasion for the Peasant The Bae.",

[Her precious ring](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=380) was ready, and as she planned—\r\n\r\nA phone call from Elizabeth. (See [Roa-Elizabeth: Love Unlasting](#edge:raora-liz))\r\n\r\nDistracted and flustered, Roa answered. She reassured Elizabeth that she was fine when the Red Knight inquired about her health. There seemed to be something going around, since Mococo was feeling unwell. After hearing Elizabeth's concerns for Mococo, [Roa quickly walked back](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=447) and mentioned that she too felt dizzy and sick from yesterday's accursed event. Elizabeth, too caring and trusting, immediately believed Roa and promised to help.\r\n\r\n[Roa's Blind, Delusional Love.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=509)\r\n\r\nHowever, fate was cruel—Roa saw Elizabeth with [Nerissa](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=781); they even shared a room. [Nerissa's rather catty comeback](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=823) pushed her over the edge, and despite Elizabeth’s comfort, Roa fled, calling Nerissa a witch.\r\n\r\nBut the determination, the delusion, was too strong, as Roa refused to give up on Elizabeth. Anger still coursed through her as she left for the Remnant fields to once again fight the Stains. Another session to destress. Only for it to come back when Nerissa was nearby. Luckily, so was [Mordan Ramsey, who offered free therapy](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=1407) to help Roa calm down.\r\n\r\n[Oh, it's so cute!](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=1786)\r\n\r\nPerhaps therapy was the way to go. Roa's mood was better as she marveled at the pretty decorations for the party tonight. Floating lanterns filled the sky as \"plates\" were already placed on the picnic blanket. Roa called Shiori to inquire what time the party would start, easily agreeing to help with the decorations after Shiori answered.\r\n\r\nDespite her pursuit of love, Roa was still the CEO of The Gacharms and managed her shop for a while. Their time in Libestal was coming to a close, but there was one more dungeon to face.\r\n\r\nWith her new pickaxe, Roa met Elizabeth outside the kingdom and warned her to beware of “[the witch](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2753)” Nerissa. Elizabeth, unfazed, reminded Roa she was a strong knight—and said the real witch was Shiori. [Roa disagreed.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2902)\r\n\r\nThey debated Shiori’s story and Nerissa’s past but couldn’t see eye to eye—Roa too jealous, Elizabeth too trusting. The topic faded, and [the mood shifted.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=3227)\r\n\r\n[A Pretty Flower for a Pretty Kitty.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=3262)\r\n\r\nFlustered, Roa left. She focused on picking flowers to use for the venue's decoration and soon returned when she had gathered enough. Back in Libestal, she saw Mococo, who, unfortunately, was still sick. Concerned, Roa gave her employee a bed to rest in and food to eat, wishing that she would get better soon.\r\n\r\nIn her shop, Roa encountered a few intruders lurking beneath the floorboards. It was just Gonathon and Nerissa. Roa followed them back to Gonathon's home, and for a moment, the two love rivals [had returned to being friends](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=4784)... until Lady Bloodflame's name was mentioned and Roa left.\r\n\r\n[Stick of Love. How Romantic.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=6482.)\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed like others may have news of their own. [One beloved employee, for instance,](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=7981) Bijou, mentioned that she and Shiori might be expecting a surprise! Though the possibility of gas lingered, Roa congratulated Bijou and wished her and Shiori the best.\r\n\r\nSoon. The Final Battle was Here.\r\n\r\nAn Advent of betrayal occurred as Shiori, Bijou, the two unrelated demon dogs, and Nerissa were cursed. Friends (and Nerissa) [attacked them,](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=8643) and it was only after Roa and the others defeated the Stains in the next stage that the curse slowly receded. Before long, those possessed were purified.\r\n\r\nA single challenge now remained: The Curse. A battle hard fought as Roa dodged the thorns that grew from the ground and the flowers that sprouted out of nowhere. Eventually, they [overcame it.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=9248)\r\n\r\nThey did it.\r\n\r\nAfter seven long days, the adventures and battles were finally over. The Princess even found the doll she gave her deceased father—a doll that looked remarkably like Fia.\r\n\r\nRoa had one last battle to face—her heart. Though she shared sweet moments with Kiara, it was still Elizabeth she longed for. With Shiori’s encouragement, Roa nervously approached the Red Knight. Elizabeth, however, warned her to be cautious of Shiori. Roa didn’t understand the distrust but agreed to respect her wishes.\r\n\r\n[The Moment Roa's Heart Broke.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=11039)\r\n\r\nShe later saw Elizabeth and Nerissa on a date in the onsen. Her delusion shattered. Maybe she never had a chance. In heartbreak, Roa turned to the first friend who came to mind—Shiori. (See [Roa-Shiori: A Witch's Cat](#edge:raora-shiori))\r\n\r\nThough saddened, there was still a party to attend. The party that saw a new, gassy one born but [quickly lost.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12121)\r\n\r\nAmid drama between The Queen and the goddess, Kiara and Roa left to steal a moment away for themselves, heading towards the Great Hall.\r\n\r\n[A Proposal](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12664)\r\n\r\nIt was a whirlwind romance. A serendipitous realization that ultimately ended in an exchange of rings and... [a Wedding](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12940). (See [Shakira-Roa: The Cat and The Cat Woman](#edge:raora-kiara))\r\n\r\nAs they celebrated this wonderful occasion, Roa would pull Shiori and Bijou away to talk. Her new wife aside, both had helped Roa tremendously during her stay in Libestal. Roa shared [her determination](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=13224) to find her happiness with her own hands.\r\n\r\nShe talked of love lost and love found in her diary.\r\n\r\n## Fanart\r\n\r\n[Big Cat, Big Pains](https://x.com/fernrOreo/status/1923057970440536174)",

As such, it was time to venture into new things. Perhaps it was the thought of selling houses that could make a profit without the stress of having to deal with the emotions. But for now, the chef had to do her daily, mundane tasks of completing side quests, upgrading her revelation for the upcoming dungeon, and reading inquiry letters she had bought.\r\n\r\nAnd unknowingly, [she accidentally read one of Shiori’s letters addressed to Gonathon!](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=389)\r\n\r\nMordan panicked.

She couldn’t openly give it to the Humble Knight either—that’d be awkward.\r\n\r\n[Evidence disposed.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=650)\r\n\r\nThe pink wolf encountered a disgruntled Roa, who had been upset by how much Nerissa was hovering around Elizabeth while killing Stains. Mordan listened to her and offered a free therapy session to lift the pink cat's spirits. This, _and her dwindling desire to keep chasing her chef dream_, led to Mordan reconsidering whether to continue her therapist career [full-time](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=1927) as _Doctor_ Mordan Ramsey—competing with Mococo's services in terms of quality.\r\n\r\nAfter that, Mordan began working on her real estate business. She sought an empty lot of land and claimed it. As she placed down her first brick, she thought auctioning new housing would market well to the homeless and the constipat- expecting families. Mordan's building process captured the eyes of her wolf pack and a few others who passed by—[even offering tours of the inside.](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=4571)\r\n\r\nBijou later informed Mordan [that Shiori was notified about the letter.](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=4673)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMordan ran a brisk trip with the rest of her fellow heroes into the _Heart of Ruin_. After they defeated _the Curse_, Mordan returned to build another BIGGER house.\r\n\r\nThe next big thing to do was to celebrate the Hot Pink One's gender reveal party, as she had been invited by Shiori a few hours ago.\r\n\r\nFamily drama between HPO, Tam Gandr, and Ina (see: [Ina-IRyS: Turning To Another](#edge:ina-irys) and [Ina-Kronii: Netorare](#edge:kronii-ina)) unfolds in front of the Lorekeeper. It feels so much like a telenovela, the therapist couldn't help but watch the show. [_She even brought out popcorn._](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=11440)\r\n\r\n[Murder is always an option.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=11842)\r\n\r\nBeing an awkward introvert at the party, Mordan and Nerissa shared a bond over forgoing romance as people gathered around to watch HPO give birth live—_and yes, Mordan filmed it._\r\n\r\n[**\"It's a boy... it's a girl... it's _gay_!**](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=12075)\r\n\r\nNot going to lie, the therapist secretly rooted for this to happen so that she could sell a house to the expecting family.

As they talked about Roa, [Shiori's phone coincidentally rang](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1096), and the panther confirmed the time of the party. After returning the book, Shiori saw Nerissa and the Red Knight have an uneasy encounter, while Mococo ran away following what appeared to be theft.\n\nYesterday's events resurfaced, ones about Shiori's wife and the _possible_ implications that... more than just gas may be in their future. As Shiori called Bijou, it seemed that Jeweled One was still ill; worse, it seemed to spread to others as Mococo showed similar symptoms of this mysterious virus. Well, at least a party for constipation was set up! Regardless, in sickness and in health, Shiori would care for Bijou.\n\n[A familiar voice.](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1732)\n\nOutside their home, it seemed her wife was talking to a familiar face. One who wore a distinctive orange jacket underneath the Libestan cloak but missing her trademark gremlin-like demeanour. Once upon a time, Shiori knew her under a different name. \"His\" name was Gonathon G. Calmer. Relaxed.\n\nAnd missing from Shiori's backlog. Shiori had never met \"him\" before. A fact that was unreciprocated, as Gonathon recalled speaking to Shiori yesterday about an item Shiori had supposedly left for her to buy. Bijou herself seemed to be aware of something by how she nudged Gonathon away to talk, a conversation Shiori was careful to avoid eavesdropping on. When the two finished, [Shiori gave the Knight a small snack for later](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=2040), a small commemoration of their \"first\" meeting.\n\nThe mystery of the stolen book was quickly solved as Mordan soon came by, as Shiori noted that the chef bought something earlier, [mistaking it for her commission](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=2438). The embarrassed chef learned more about the bookkeeping mechanics and shared that she did deliver the book to Gonathon's home when she realized her mistake. Mordan was at least quite satisfied with her commission when she discovered it had already been delivered yesterday.\n\nNot to waste a day and to understand the puzzle, Shiori would call Gonathon to join her in some quests. After ensuring that Bijou would be cared for while she was away, Shiori left for the Remnant fields. There was a certain familiarity to the Knight, the way they talked, and the ease of their camaraderie.\n\n[That's very kind of you, Gigi](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=3283)\n\nBut something about her, about yesterday, kept Shiori from using \"his\" name. Gonathon was confused, of course she was. She wasn't privy to the memories Shiori had. The only memories she could recall were the times in Libestal and nothing beyond the story they were trapped in. Despite this, they fell into conversation easily. Too easily.\n\n[Gigi-Shiori](#edge:gigi-shiori)\n\n[A Sweet Moment Under the Stars](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4171)\n\nDeep talks and sillier moments—there were more memories for Shiori to add to her archive. A strange feeling lingered inside her.\n\n[**_Ruined_**](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6148)\n\nIn the last dungeon, a voice called out to Shiori.\n\n\"_Don't let anyone leave alive_.\"\n\nA call that Bijou, the demon dogs, and Nerissa answered as they glowed with an eerie light and flew. Mad, sinister laughs echoed throughout the dungeon's library as the possessed attacked their friends with ruinous magic... Shiori felt fine, taking a moment to observe everyone's panic while adding a book to her collection. Still, Shiori did have to join in on the fun, [cursing one in particular with a vicious memory](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6446) before they were eventually saved and the darkness seemingly purified.\n\nFinally, The Curse.\n\n[An attractive one](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6687), but unfortunately, betrayal was limited only to the heroes who played the game. The narrative dictates that this boss must be beaten. Which was soon attained [but at a temporary cost](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6977). Soon the Outlander and Iphania appeared to thank everyone for their heroic deeds. Libsetal was saved, and a familiar grey doll. Fia. The doll gifted to the deceased King had finally found her way back to the Princess's arms.\n\nOne important event was left: The ~~Constipation~~ Party. All was well; [Fuwawa's catering](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7271) was superb, delicious food lined each framed plate, the Roa's field of flowers brought life to the venue, and Bijou's lanterns brought light into the sky. To Shiori's relief, Bijou was also well—the gas, not a child, and the curse had dissipated. A certain hero finally learned of [expecting news](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7930) as well. Soon, the party, and the birthing bed (yes, a birthing bed), were ready.\n\n_Baby included_. [The Hot Pink One was in labor](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8883). In a questionable display of entertainment, IRyS gave birth, buckets of water desecrating the previously wonderful picnic venue, to the attendants' disgust. Sadly, or not, the ~~chick~~ baby [was gone too soon](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=9845) by the Fuzzy One's claws as fire burned the picnic blanket while a fight broke out between the guests. Finally having had enough, [Shiori stepped away](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10172) to start the last diary entry. As she entered the Library, Shiori saw a distressed Ina. The goddess's infidelity had finally come to light, and the hero questioned whether the not-so-dearly departed child was hers. Shiori could only offer her sympathies, witnessing the Hot Pink One's questionable actions beforehand.\n\nBut not to worry, for there is a joyous occasion to be had—a wedding! Between Roa and Kiara.\n\nThroughout the day and the previous ones, Shiori had witnessed and supported Roa's *purr*suit of love. It was fraught with [great challenge](#edge:raora-liz) that culminated in Roa's defeat. But, from the ashes sprouts [forth another love: Kiara](#edge:raora-kiara).\n\nShiori would walk the beautiful businesswoman down the aisle as the crowd cheered for the new couple's happiness. She worried for a moment that this may have been a ploy to steal Elizabeth's attention, as the knight was Kiara's best woman, Roa assured her that this was true happiness, something that Roa would reaffirm later as she declared to [fight for herself](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10949). Shiori congratulated Roa, promising to complete [the commissions](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8350) soon and send them their way.\n\n[Group Photo! Huzzah!](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10859)\n\nSwept up by the flow of events, Shiori shared her feelings with Bijou. Insecure since their relationship was unbalanced by what Shiori remembered and what Bijou couldn't. But that didn't matter, not to Bijou. She promised Shiori that she would be the only one Bijou would love. Taking heart the lessons from the past, they would take it slow, and when the time comes to talk, they shall. Shiori accepted.\n\n[Ring of Promise](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11132)\n\nThe ring now decorates their door as a precious blue flower guards [their home, GothRock](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11372). A cheeky kiss from Bijou had Shiori chuckling fondly as her wife scamped about, bringing her brother with her soon after Nerissa's arrival. The two witches then swiftly decided to have Bijou join as a witch-in-training.\n\nIt was a day filled with many, many events to write down. As Shiori submitted her diary for the day, something caught her eye:\n\n[**_Betrayal_**](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11957)\n\nAn entry written by her own hand, filled with pain. It detailed the Knight's anger, Shiori's sorrows, and ultimately the decision to move on from their relationship. There was more to this; Shiori needed Gonathon's side to... this event. They met in the Library, where Shiori read her entry to Gonathon—[though they couldn't seem to find a private place to talk](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=12352).\n\nGonathon confirmed that not everything written was true; she might have been furious, but she could never lay a hand on Shiori. Never. Shiori learned more about their relationship. Of their hastiness and then Gonathon's hesitance to continue this romance. But Gonathon affirmed that the kindness Shiori showed her, _him_, was always there—every day. Though her memories were gone, [something lingered in Shiori's heart whenever she met Gonathon](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=12655). A bittersweet feeling that left tears in its wake.\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"I can not quite recall it, but I can feel it\" by TomYumKung_Art](https://x.com/TomYumKung_Art/status/1922095825062117883)\n\n[\"Maybe I'm not as kind as you thought\" by Yog](https://x.com/MassiveYog/status/1923695201052393918)",

Even though she may leave her friends behind, she knows that one day in the distant future, she will run into them again.

Surprisingly, she didn't look bothered; in fact, it rather seemed intentional that she allowed them to find it.\r\n\r\nAs if it were an invitation to a baptism of a transformed being.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[CORRUPTION](#embed:https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=8881)\r\n\r\nSo far, all of the dungeons had been conquered but one– the Heart of Ruin– the source of ruination, corrupting the whole of Libestal.\r\n\r\nThe heroes prepared, making sure they were fully equipped to ensure victory.\r\n\r\nAnd when the time was right, they entered the dungeon… Until…\r\n\r\nNerissa noticed something was different. She had been corrupted! Yet she was not alone, as a few other members-- Shiori of the Nyavella, the Fuzzy One, the Fluffy One, and Princess Bijou-- had been infected by the Stains as well.\r\n\r\nHow they were chosen was unknown. One thing was clear, however: it was beyond their control, and it was up to their friends to save them… or, perhaps, take their lives if worse comes to worst.\r\n\r\nAnd as expected of the heroes, they did their best in winning their friends back as they attempted to purify them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**SOMETHING PERSONAL?**\r\n\r\nFate was such a trickster. Having been possessed, the corruption guided Nerissa to [haunt](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9100) Roa Pandora, enabling her to see through the secrets of her heart. The corrupted “witch” finally confirmed and confronted her about the woman’s growing feelings for Lady Bloodflame and the jealousy she harbored for her blossoming relationship with Lady Bloodflame.\r\n\r\n_“You stole the Red Knight”_\r\n\r\n_“I stole no such thing,”_ she quipped back.\r\n\r\n_\"You... evil witch! I knew you were evil from the very beginning\"_\r\n\r\nRoa Pandora struggled in fighting for her sanity, while the raven one laughed at her demise.\r\n\r\nAfter quite some time, the big cat was finally able to get out of her possession… Only at the cost of another person—[Lady Bloodflame](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9228).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**THE FIRE THAT PURIFIES?**\r\n\r\n_“Come to your senses!”_ the knight shouted.\r\n\r\n_“Come to my senses?_ I think I came to those a long ago”\r\n\r\nIt did not take long for the valiant knight to overcome the possession. Was it because of divine protection? Perhaps the “witch” has learned the Red Maiden’s true feelings by entering her mind and so could not truly hurt her? Maybe it was the blue flames of the scarlet warrior that consumed the corruption?\r\n\r\nBefore they knew it, the pure knight had [\"cleansed\"](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9259) Nerissa and won her over to their side again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**THE HEART OF RUIN**\r\n\r\nYet, such was just the beginning... As the heroes had yet to face the heart of Ruin and bring to an end the evil it had caused.\r\n\r\nEntering the [final](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9412) dungeon, the warriors fought in all their might, side by side, even those that had been corrupted once. Together, with their own skills and the power of their bonds, the Shining Stars had successfully defeated the The Curse, saving the world once more...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**SHATTERED MIRROR**\r\n\r\nDespite all the celebrations, Nerissa couldn’t seem to find the same joy she had from the beginning.\r\n\r\nShe had already been purified, right? And yet… her heart still felt empty as a [void](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=14765). As if there was a growing shadow engulfing all the light and happiness within her. As if buried in eternal winter, her soul became numb. Perhaps, devoid of love, even.\r\n\r\n_“You see, my heart is still dyed black.”_\r\n\r\n_“I have no intention of ‘saving’ anything.”_\r\n\r\nThis looming darkness, wherever its roots came from, she finally embraced as her own. Whether it was just an illusion or the reality, it mattered no longer.\r\n\r\nShe had accepted this form.\r\n\r\nThe monster that had been trapped in the mirror has finally broken free.\r\n\r\nAfter all, _NOTHING STAYS PURE_...\r\n\r\n## Fanart\r\n\r\n[\"Nerissa Ravencroft 🎼\" by SHAF](https://x.com/shafpng/status/1886083673935798700)\r\n\r\n[\"Witch\" by yuri_kyanon](https://x.com/yuri_kyanon/status/1921582803809886659)\r\n\r\n[\"My reflection is that of a forgotten stranger\" by Eli](https://x.com/Elisbian_/status/1920609369328079156)\r\n\r\n[\"The one they call The Witch\" by Hexcaster1636](https://x.com/lancaster_1636/status/1924872752890077294)\r\n\r\n[rkgk by Magho](https://x.com/M_Agho/status/1920808679089009020)\r\n\r\n[\"Nothing stays pure\" by ArizaZarigueya](https://x.com/Hanaswing/status/1921134059658330192)",

Bijou shares her recent conversation with others, which leads them to believe that perhaps it's just [constipation](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=y5yjkh4NAX9clGIW&t=399), or perhaps a weird virus; only time could tell. Still, she desired to meet her beloved, and Shiori wanted to give her food, so they agreed to meet at the archiver's house.\r\n\r\nBut upon reaching the archiver's door, she's first met with Gonathon G. Bijou quickly realizes that the archiver has no recollection of the knight. This forces her to intervene and have a private chat with him. Bijou tells him that Shiori was considering temporarily deleting her memories of him, and now she knew that it worked.\r\n\r\n[Well this is awkward](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=TuIqi8kS_tcjKH5u&t=851)\r\n\r\nOnce Bijou notices that her onii-chan woke up, she immediately wants to show her the [preparations](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=ASbpOoYyeE-xFFaZ&t=3584) for the party, and HPO notices that the sign saying \"ITS GAS\" is too visible, so Bijou takes it upon herself to hide it.\r\n\r\nAs she's placing the final touches, people are gathering at the wagon to face the Heart of Ruin. In the meantime, Fuwawa report the same stomachache as Bijou and Mococo.\r\n\r\n_\"IT COULD BE GAS, IT COULD BE GAS THO, I CAN'T TELL\"_\r\n\r\nAnd in the end... It was not gas... Nor a pregnancy but a secret third thing. The Curse. The curse has inflicted Shiori, Fuwawa, Mococo, Nerissa, and Bijou.\r\n\r\n[May the lands burn](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=59l0U4sYULFe2bYR&t=5230)\r\n\r\nThrough its powers controlled their minds and forced them to attack and hunt their allies, but with the combined power of the heroes from beyond the stars, they managed to purify them.\r\n\r\nWith the power of the revelations in one hand and the potato in the other, the heroes manage to defeat the formidable foe and [save Libestal](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=MuH6a3gYsGGU4iHY&t=6043) from the Stain. They quickly meet with Princess Iphania, and there is no betrayal this time; they have done it, they've changed fate. And as they're speaking, they notice a doll next to them, the same doll Iphania has given to her father, and one they were familiar with, Fia.\r\n\r\nImmerkind seems to be doing okay, and so is Fia at the Library. This left them puzzled, but without more hints to go by, they decided to wait for the banquet for answers. Now, there was something way more important to them, Bijou's onii-chan's pregnancy/gas reveal party.\r\n\r\nThe picnic starts innocently enough, there is food, decorations, fireworks, music, and happy guests. The Hot Pink One manages to confess her feelings to NinoIna, her eternal consort, and she feels the same.\r\n\r\nAs they are all gathered to see the miracle of birth and/or the liberation of gas, Bijou starts to reveal the sign hidden in bricks, and they all can see it says \"ITS GAS.\" Not only is it gas, but, as she also tells everyone, the pink wool behind reveals it's a girl, a gassy girl!\r\n\r\n[It's Gas!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=oFCqx7ndLwdT4gdb&t=8748)\r\n\r\nSadly, things quickly go south. As the baby is taking her first steps, Mococo kills her, and HPO is heartbroken and finds herself in denial. Then, soon after, a fight erupts between Bijou's stepmother, Queen Tam Gandr, and her onii-chan (see [Hot Pink One-Tam](#edge:irys-kronii)).\r\n\r\n[Maps... maps... I love maps...](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=i-m4qvVv7hVV7F09&t=12638)\r\n\r\nBijou finds herself lost in this conflict; she realizes her sister is leaving her onii-chan, and a duel is set between Gonathon and the Hot Pink One, with concerning stakes. If the princess' brother were to lose, someone would have to cut open her stomach. With no one else willing to fulfill this task, Bijou decides to take it upon herself... Maps... Maps... Maps... Maps are the only true...\r\n\r\nAnd so, the duel starts. And while the goddess tries her best, she quickly finds out she's no match for the knight, and it is time for her punishment. Bijou gets close to her onii-chan and starts the excruciating process, she cuts, and cuts, and cuts. Reaping everything out, making sure there is nothing left inside. And at the end of this, she finds inside a single thing... A... Soul...? Alcohol...?\r\n\r\n[Girl you got that in you?](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=gbQWcwUyuRlq2Gzd&t=9631)\r\n\r\nThere's little time to think about it, because a wedding was going on at that moment between [Shakira and Roa](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=pz0kfmf9vTMEW-NB&t=9791) Pandora, huzzah! What a joyous occasion! However, Bijou is a bit confused, as she thought her boss was interested in Lady Bloodflame.\r\n\r\nThey have a quick talk, and Roa tells the princess that she has decided to seek what was best for her and find someone who had eyes for her. This inspired Bijou.\r\n\r\nShiori seeks her out, she wants to talk about the future. Bijou desires to be with her, but the witch expresses worries of taking advantage of her, as the princess has not yet regained all her memories.\r\n\r\nWithout time to lose, Bijou runs to buy a ring, a ring not to propose, but to promise her beloved that, no matter what, she only has eyes for her. Bijou doesn't mind being used, as long as they can be together. And Shiori accepts the ring.\r\n\r\n[Rock hard again](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=ti6H09S9SrEnuLNp&t=10106)\r\n\r\nThey teleport to the witch's house, set the ring on display, and rename it to The Home of Gothrock, as they will now live together.\r\n\r\nBijou leaves her home once more to talk with her onii-chan, which led the little princess to stand in the middle of the conflict between her step mother and her brother once more. Tam, deciding she no longer wishes to keep wasting her time arguing, leaves, leaving Bijou and the Hot Pink One alone.\r\n\r\nIs it then that her brother is determined to convince Bijou the princess that the queen only desires to use her. However, Bijou is reluctant to believe this.\r\n\r\n[Jaslighting](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=fuv5o4ggw4tby11g&t=13403)\r\n\r\nWithout being able to choose a side, Bijou can only run and cry. Why must the people she loves fight? Why must there be conflict everywhere? Bijou did not know, the only thing she knew for sure...\r\n\r\nIt was maps.

            "content": "**A New Start for a Weary Heart**\n\nThe day started like any other, with Gonathon doing his rounds and visiting companions. But upon arriving at Shiori’s home, the Humble Knight was met with a [sobering discovery](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=482): the witch he had grown close with had no memories of him and greeted Gonathon as a stranger. For most, such a revelation would leave them numb or furious. But the Humble Knight responded only with a gentle greeting and a brief explanation of who he was.\n\nPerhaps deep down, he recalled going through this before and had grown used to it. Or maybe he accepted Shiori’s choice as justified. Whatever the reason, after a short conversation with Bijou and Shiori, the melancholic knight learned Mordan Ramsey had mistakenly purchased the book and hurried off to find her.\n\n[To Gonathon: Ooopsies](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=1177s)\n\nThankfully, the absent-minded therapist quickly realized her mistake and left the book for Gonathon at the knight’s treehouse. Cradling it in his hands, Gonathon [read it](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=1555) and learned that Shiori had hidden several important items for him being the treehouse. Swiftly collecting them, Gonathon had no time to read their contents as Shiori—now calling him “G”—contacted him for assistance in the newest resource area, a request he was happy to oblige.\n\n[A Chance to Begin Again](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=1775)\n\nMeeting the amnesiac archiver (see [Gonathon-Shiori: The Moon Sets So the Sun May Rise](#edge:gigi-shiori)), the two shared a [tender scene](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=2130) in which Gonathon reminded Shiori of their time together, and Shiori talked about Gonathon’s true self, “G.” Watching the sun rise together, they promised to meet again and parted ways. Matters of the heart would have to wait; the Heart of Ruin had to fall!\n\n[Humble knights don't look at sunsets!](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=2901)\n\nGathering with the other adventurers, Gonathon briefly spoke with Peasant the Bae about her plan to propose to Immerkind. As more friends arrived, Gonathon received many powerful items for the upcoming quest, each one a symbol of the relationships he had forged. With the tardy Tam Gandr finally appearing, the fellowship of smiths, cooks, suppliers, and jewelers descended into [the darkest of dungeons](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=4912). Through hard-fought battles, Gonathon helped purify his friends and ultimately slay the malignant Curse, seemingly saving the kingdom.\n\nReturning triumphantly, he faced his next quest: assisting Bae (see [Bae-Gonathon: A Bromance of Eternity Borne Under the Light of the New Moon](#edge:bae-gigi)). Directing Immerkind to the fated bridge, Gonathon listened as Immerkind swiftly rejected Bae, leaving the brokenhearted peasant still clutching the flowers meant for the princess-obsessed doll. Realizing Bae intended to drown herself, the mortified Gonathon [leaped into action](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=6605), succumbing to the murky depths with her several times as he pleaded for her to reconsider. Finally seeing the light, Bae swore an oath of brotherhood with Gonathon, solidifying another bond the knight had built.\n\n[Today we rise... as brothers!](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=7101)\n\nBack at the party site, Gonathon witnessed the voracious Hot Pink One demanding Tam Gandr be the godparent of her expected spawnling (see [Gonathon-Irys: Even God's Can Bleed](#edge:irys-gigi)). Tam refused, and the queen and Gonathon retreated to Mordan Ramsey's home to seek counsel (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Immortal Game](#edge:kronii-gigi)). After receiving wisdom from Mordan—including to simply slay HPO—the queen and her retainer returned to the raucous celebration.\n\n[I must answer to my queen!](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=8982)\n\nThere, the diabolical deity again slung insults at Tam, dredging up memories of the queen's time as HPO's maid. Unable to stand by, Gonathon challenged HPO to a duel. If HPO won, Tam would be forced to be her child’s godparent, but if Gonathon won, the degenerate nephilim would stop tormenting the queen. In [a stunning display](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9283), he quickly cut down HPO. After some much-deserved praise from Tam, he departed to speak with Immerkind.\n\nIn a [heartfelt, bittersweet scene](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9825), Immerkind laid out her plans to stay behind. Although Gonathon reiterated his desire not to leave his most treasured friend, he understood her decision. They promised to meet again and, after one last hearty awooo, parted ways.\n\nOnce again alone, the Humble Knight finally read the notes Shiori had left. In them, she thanked Gonathon for their time together and urged him to make choices for himself, rather than follow others blindly. She finished by reaffirming that, despite all the tragedy between them, Gonathon was still a [good person deep down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=11436s). Gonathon reflected on all his experiences in the past Libestal and concluded it would be best if he, too, went on a [journey of reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=10505s).\n\n[We will meet again!](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9925)\n\nBut his trials were not yet over. He received a call from Shiori, who revealed she had found the diaries of her past self, laying bare the trauma they had endured in their brief relationship.\n\nGonathon steeled himself and, rather than flee or make excuses, charged in to confront Shiori. He explained his side and [lamented the way he had treated her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=11316s). Having seemingly righted past wrongs, the knight thanked her, and as the two parted, Shiori gave a seemingly innocent farewell: \"See you tomorrow.\"\n\nWith the day’s adventures behind him, Gonathon tied up loose ends. He visited Bae, who was decorating her house for her children, and Tam Gandr, who was hatching [a new plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=13105s) to get back at HPO. Seeing his friends full of vigor and determination, Gonathon reflected on his own trials and vowed to keep moving forward.\n\nAfter writing his journal, the Humble Knight turned in for the night. One final day remained—and with the Curse destroyed, it would hopefully be one of celebration and rest.\n\n[The sun will always rise](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=14284s)",

But apparently, that doesn’t mean it can’t happen again. This time, though, IRyS was _certain_. She believed, truly and deeply, that what she carried was no longer just air—but life. A living soul between her and her eternal consort.\n\nHer ever-supportive brother, of course, had already begun preparing. As any good sibling would.\n\n[Gender reveal party](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=498)\n\nA gender reveal party, open to the entire kingdom. Everyone was invited to share in the joy, even if half of them [didn’t really know](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=657) _what_ the occasion was. The venue was nothing short of grand—thanks to her brother and Roa. Seats for guests, a ceremonial birthing area (yes, on the spot), and above all, a great sign floating in the sky, ready to unveil the gender of the not-yet-born.\n\nIRyS was excited—not just for herself, but for her beloved, her eternal consort, who had no idea they were expecting. She couldn't wait to see their face.\n\n[Can't wait for the moment](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=1116)\n\nStill, even with this gas-baby situation looming, she had a world to save. Duty called. She joined the others in the final dungeon, taking on world-ending threats… but her mind stayed locked on [her stomach](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=2354).\n\nOnce that small feat—saving the world—was accomplished, it was time for the real event.\n\nIRyS had already picked out [names](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=3581). Gaston, if it were a boy. Gaslonia, if it were a girl. (Tasteful.) At the venue, guests gathered. Some excited. Some confused. Some deeply, deeply concerned. And most notably, her eternal consort stood among them—surely about to be shocked and overjoyed.\n\nExcept... someone else was there too.\n\nTammy.\n\nYou know, _the other_ one IRyS had been involved with. And Tammy, invited to a gender reveal for a child between IRyS and _someone else_, was _not_ having it. Her disgust was visible. Her rage, palpable. She even asked IRyS’ brother to [knock some sense](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5189) into her. Fair.\n\nBut the show must go on.\n\nEveryone turned to the sign in the sky. It slowly revealed its message. One letter at a time.\n\n[It's a boy, it's a girl, no, it's ~~gay~~](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5636)\n\nIt was a... gas.\n\nNot a girl. Not a boy. Not an attack helicopter.\n\n_A gas_. Well, a _girl gas_, to be specific.\n\nIRyS was elated. Too elated. She went into labor right then and there.\n\n[Live birthing is crazy](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5739)\n\nWater broke. On to guests. Ew. Encouragements flew around the room: “Push! Push!” And then—pop. It was over. Except… she never saw the baby. Never held it. News came fast: Mococo had already _killed_ it. Somehow.\n\nIRyS didn’t even question it. She just felt relief, like passing the biggest gas she'd ever had.\n\nAnd then things spiraled.\n\nApparently, the child was actually [Tam and Ina’s](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=6901). Apparently, Tam and Ina had feelings for each other. Apparently, IRyS only saw Tam as a sister figure—despite their history. And Ina? Was she cheating on IRyS? No one knew what was real anymore (see [Kronii-IRyS: The Audacity](#edge:irys-kronii) and [Ina-IRyS: Turning To Another](#edge:ina-irys)).\n\nShe wrote it all down in her [journal](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=11636)—perhaps one of the last. Her account of childbirth. Of fading bonds. And a promise: if her eternal consort was truly turning away, truly seeking Tammy...\n\nIRyS would bring her back.\n\nNo matter what it took.",

Ina had no idea what the occasion was about, but knowing her consort, it could be anything.

It was a simple matter for the benevolent Queen to delay the apocalypse by twenty minutes, for she was also the Warden of Time.\r\n\r\nThe fight for the future of Libestal began when all the heroes converged, Queen Tam being the last to arrive. Upon entering the final dungeon—the Heart of Ruin—Queen Tam was greeted with a grim curse: [the Curse of Betrayal](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=452). Apparently, some of the heroes had been corrupted, turning against the forces of good, and now had to be purified.\r\n\r\nThese cursed individuals were Shiori, Nerissa, Bijou, the Fuzzy One, and the Fluffy One, all of whom began to haunt their former comrades. Queen Tam was [haunted by her stepdaughter, Bijou,](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=646) while desperately fighting against the Stains, the voice of her stepdaughter urging her to attack everyone and give in to her darkest desires.\r\n\r\nNext came Shiori, far more skilled at exposing Queen Tam’s flaws. The abusive relationships, the vanity, the pet-play allegations—[everything was laid bare](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=750) by the corrupted Archivist, as Queen Tam vehemently denied each imperfection.\r\n\r\n[\"These are just allegations!\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=750)\r\n\r\nAfter successfully purifying their companions—and surviving all the humiliation in Queen Tam's case—Her Highness and the heroes emerged victorious and proceeded to the final stage. The battle against The Curse began with Queen Tam and the heroes [immediately jumping the enemy](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=990), not even letting it finish its monologue.\r\n\r\nThe fight was long and brutal. The Curse was unrelenting and vicious with its attacks, and could heal whenever one of the heroes fell, their Revelations could barely keep up. The Queen watched as her own knight Gonathon, tanked a heavy hit and was [brought down to his knees](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=1244).\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing to fear. Queen Tam and the others [vanquished The Curse](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=1269) for good. It was a battle worthy of legends, destined to be passed down for generations.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving gratitude from the Outlander and Princess Iphania, the benevolent Queen began checking in on her subjects, starting with Immerkind, who was smitten with the Princess and likely distraught over her apparent relationship with the Outlander. The Queen also mingled with the common folk and [discovered a budding romance among them](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=1787).\r\n\r\nNow, if this were where Queen Tam's day ended, it would have been perfect. But in true Queen Tam Gandr fashion, trouble was drawn to her like a moth to flame.\r\n\r\n[\"Immerkind in distress\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=2291)\r\n\r\nOne might say there should be a way to forcefully tell the Queen to put down the proverbial shovel and stop digging, but the voices in her head were ignored like passing wind. Immerkind, clearly in distress, failed to perform a proper curtsy. The Queen, taking immediate offense, would later feel awful—classic Queen Tam—upon learning of her emotional state.\r\n\r\nAfter offering comforting words to the green knight about her situation with Peasant the Bae, Queen Tam invited her to attend the Hot Pink One's cursed “gender reveal” party. Why the Queen wanted to attend at all, no one truly knows.\r\n\r\nShe was greeted with the same bombastic sign—\"ITS GAS\"—that she had made the day before, now covered for dramatic effect. Naturally, the Queen wasted no time in digging another proverbial hole, unearthing drama like a seasoned groundhog. For reasons unfathomable, Queen Tam implied she was open to a [three-way relationship](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=2732) with HPO and her Consort Eternal, NinoIna (see [Kronii-IRyS: The Audacity](#edge:irys-kronii)).\r\n\r\nQueen Tam next found herself attending Shakira and Roa Pandora’s wedding in the Great Hall. The voices in her head noted, yet again, that she never learned. First HPO’s “gender reveal” party, and now the wedding of her previous-timeline lover. Still, she stood in silence, watching one of her “happinesses” marry another.\r\n\r\n[\"Say cheese,\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5155) she said as she had herself participate in the group photo.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the ceremony wasn’t spared from drama. Queen Tam began implying that the “gas baby” was actually hers, which spiraled when NinoIna claimed the child was born [from all three of them](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5204). One could barely keep composure while chronicling these strange Libestan happenings.\r\n\r\nThis hatched a plan in Queen Tam's mind. Why not just take NinoIna for herself? She hired Mordan Ramsey to be her [wingman](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5950) and set the plan in motion. Queen Tam and Mordan visited NinoIna, and she [immediately began gaslighting](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=6034) her to think that she does not deserve to be saddled with HPO and her baggage. Finally, the Queen was in her element and seemed to have successfully planted the seeds of doubt.\r\n\r\n[\"All according to keikaku.\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=6588)\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with her accomplishment, [Queen Tam deemed it necessary to stalk](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=6916) NinoIna's house and saw HPO lurking around. They pretended not to see each other, quite literally, much to Bijou's distress, who was caught in the crossfire between two unrelenting petty forces insulting each other through her.\r\n\r\n[\"Why did I decide to love someone like you?\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=7701)\r\n\r\nBefore retiring for the day, Queen Tam visited Mordan Ramsey, who was busy preparing the house that she would auction the next day (to which the Queen was humble enough to proclaim she could not afford anyway). It was there that she confided to Mordan and Gonathon more of what she had talked about with HPO. Perhaps in a moment of true sincerity, [Mordan Ramsey gave her the ring](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=8737) she bought and was not able to use, for she was not able to find love in this timeline, hoping that Queen Tam would be able to find some use for it instead.\r\n\r\nAfter writing in her journal and having a quick but [heartfelt reflection with Gonathon](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=9187) on what transpired that day, Queen Tam finally retired for the day.",

This horror wasn’t just a tale—they lived it firsthand, as some of their own comrades fell to the Curse and turned against them. Fortunately, through determination and unity, the heroes were able to purify and bring them back.\r\n\r\nUltimately, they triumphed. The Curse was vanquished, and with it, the corruption's grip on the world came to an end. Their goal was achieved.\r\n\r\nBut just as the dust settled, they discovered something unsettling—a doll, identical in appearance to Fia, lying motionless on the ground. What it meant, and why it appeared only after the Curse’s defeat, remained a mystery. Only time would tell what truth it held.\r\n\r\n#### Uncovered Lore Books\r\n\r\n- [Read \"Prelude of Ruin\"](#text:prelude-of-ruin)\r\n- [Read \"Song of Ruin\"](#text:song-of-ruin)\r\n\r\n#### Update NPCs\r\n\r\n- See [Fia](#node:fia)\r\n- See [Iphania](#node:iphania)\r\n- See [Outlander](#node:outlander)",

Sure, the pink one was a handful, but Ina had always handled her chaos with grace and ease. They were inseparable ever since their very first adventure.\n\nNow, their lives were about to change—forever, and for the better—as the two lovebirds stepped into a new chapter: parenthood.\n\n[The gift of life](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=3845)\n\nThey exchanged gifts, shared heartfelt words, and with the promise of new life growing between them, their connection felt stronger than ever. Hand in hand, they looked ahead to a future together... until things started getting weird. Fast.\n\nTam—Tammy—whatever you wanted to call her, couldn’t stand the sight of the Pink One cuddling and fawning over someone else right in front of her. The same Pink One who had once promised love who now had the _audacity_ to ask her to be godfather to a child that wasn't even theirs. It was an insult layered on betrayal.\n\n[She does not love you](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5979)\n\nSo Tam did what Tam had to do—she told Ina the truth. That the Pink One had been sneaking around, stringing both of them along, trying to hold onto Ina while keeping Tam in her grasp. It was a desperate attempt to sever the bond between the pink and the purple—and it worked.\n\nThings escalated fast. Tam ordered her knight, Gonathon, to \"teach the Pink One a lesson.\" But instead of accepting defeat, the Pink One turned it into a duel between herself and Gonathon. She could’ve ended it there—but no, for some _unfathomable_ reason, she added a wager: if she lost, she would have her abdomen cut open to check if the so-called child—this gas baby—was actually inside her.\n\nWhy.\n\n[Warning: Gore](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=6563)\n\nShe lost. And after that, she started losing something far more painful.\n\nTam moved in, taking advantage of the moment, slowly pulling Ina away from her. She used her [all-powerful rizz](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=6881), her charm, and her presence to win Ina over—and it worked. The Pink One watched as her consort, once hers and hers alone, began to drift further away, inching closer to Tam with every moment.\n\nDesperate, the Pink One enlisted her brother’s help to secretly spy on Ina—to know what she _really_ thought of her. And what she saw shattered her completely.\n\nIna wanted to be with Tam instead.\n\n[Unintelligible gasps of shock](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=8322)\n\nSomething within her broke. Something dark, obsessive, and primal. She would do anything to take her consort back. Anything.",

When she noticed her, the knight mentioned she was making some [fireworks](https://youtu.be/sDjysXFWYbI?t=10435), to which the Maiden replied it was a good idea and said she too would make one for herself.\n\nThe lady knight, yearning for more of her presence, stopped her from leaving, giving her quite a lot of her own. Nerissa claimed it was her first time doing it, and so did Lady Bloodflame, but she offered to test them out together on the roof. Just the two of them.\n\nAnd so they did… however, it was already morning, so they had to postpone it till evening.\n\nFate must have been too cruel, for it didn’t prove successful. Nerissa needed to gather some more ingredients, and when the sun finally gave way to the moon, she caught Elizabeth testing the fireworks with Roa Pandora.\n\nHer heart has already grown cold. She shouldn't be affected any longer...\n\n---\n\n**_\"Skin to skin.\"_**\n\nAn onsen. A place to relax and unwind. A request not to be inappropriate.\n\nNerissa and Elizabeth find themselves across from one another, chatting lightly in the comforting heat of the water.\n\nThe idea of [personal space is temporarily lost](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=11173) as Nerissa's voice dips sultry and sweet. Honeyed and sinful. The way she speaks as she inches closer and closer until they are face-to-face. If either leaned forward even just a hair, their lips might touch.\n\nAnother sweet giggle in her ear has Nerissa backing away from Elizabeth—the strawberry curse returns. Suddenly, Nerissa is getting out without warning, leaving Elizabeth scrambling to do the same and get dressed.\n\nThat voice echoed in the back of her skull for a moment.\n\n---\n\n**_Loyalty to an Evil King._**\n\nEvery angle feels like it's suffocating Elizabeth with these questions. Would she once again dedicate herself to the corrupt King? She is... a knight. Who pledges her loyalty to the King. But if he's corrupt, is it the right thing to do? Do you betray your King or follow in his shadow of darkness?\n\nThe harsh recall of memory. Nerissa asked her why she would stand by the King after he betrayed them. As he hurt them all. As she heard Mococo's pained cry her sister fell for just a moment.\n\nA question left unanswered in the end. Elizabeth doesn't know the right path for a knight. For her. Despite having experienced that path once.\n\n---\n\n**_\"You were in my home.\"_**\n\n[The sudden tone is dark.](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=11611) Nerissa sounds angry. Hurt. Elizabeth stumbles over her words a bit. \"It was to protect you! I-I wouldn't break and enter unless I had reason!\"\n\nAfter all, Elizabeth had been the one tricked!\n\n4 replaced discs. 200 gold to help fix a broken door—a rose without reason.\n\nSuddenly, a soft laugh breaks the heavy tension. Nerissa isn't angry, just teasing. Relief settles over Elizabeth's shoulders at that.\n\nAfter all, it was done to ensure Nerissa's safety. A proper knight would knock and await an answer. Not bash down a door in a brazen move without just cause.\n\n_I dare not trust your words, but you are a danger - so locked up you must._\n\n---\n\n**_\"The monster behind me now stands before you.\"_**\n\nThe recent development in their relationship would have probably made one maiden’s heart swoon. Elizabeth had started warming up to her—following her around, giving her gifts, showering her with praises, and making sure she was well and protected.\n\nShe even called her beautiful. And promised she would always stay by her side…\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nIf only the Scarlet Knight had realized a bit earlier… she would’ve folded and lowered her defenses. However, thorns have already grown on the flesh of this delicate rose. Every warm and gentle touch would sting deeper, making it ever more painful to bear.\n\nThe cards had been flipped. Elizabeth was oblivious to the menacing side of the person she was falling for. As if entranced by the siren’s sweet song, she moved according to the witch’s will.\n\nDefenseless. Vulnerable. On the palm of the monster she created.\n\n## Fanart\n\n[Fireworks by Zel Maelstrom](https://x.com/zelmaelstrom/status/1922143256164356165)\n\n[\"Onsen\" by thekaiyip](https://x.com/thekaiyip/status/1921344476032663740)\n\n[\"in the bath\" by set](https://x.com/_se_t_/status/1921155712278798577)\n\n[\"🍽️\" by soap](https://x.com/SiFXi_/status/1922715233606377622)",

She was truly a “monster,” befitting of the song titled Monster being played in the background. Forcing Queen Tam to celebrate her conception with another lover wasn’t enough—she also had to make her the godmother.\n\n[\"You sicken me...\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3072)\n\nAccompanied by her trusty knight, Gonathon, Queen Tam ran away from the scene in anger and disgust. [\"Back off, you monster!\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3146) Queen Tam said, poison in her speech. Seeking shelter in her own home, Queen Tam and Gonathon were visited by the licensed therapist (among many things), [Mordan Ramsey](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3175). It was finaly time for her long-overdue therapy.\n\nAfter a few interruptions, Queen Tam was finally able to [trauma dump](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3600), explaining all her woes, most of which seemed to trace back to a single source: the Hot Pink One. Fortunately, they had the best therapist in town.\n\n[\"Have you considered murder?\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3721)\n\nSuch was the \"based\" take by the renowned therapist/chef/real estate magnate. Murder was a question, and the answer was always \"yes.\" Just eliminate the root of her problems—HPO. The voices in Queen Tam’s head all agreed, even as she questioned the legitimacy of Dr. Mordan’s license.\n\nIt was then that Mordan revealed that HPO had three \"wives,\" insinuating that there was also something in between her and Bijou, her own brother. Of course, it was not a Libestal delicacy without a sprinkling of an additional forbidden ingredient that rhymes with [\"in chest\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3844).\n\nSpeaking of the devil, HPO called Queen Tam and begged her to attend the \"gender reveal\" party, to which pretty much everyone involved already knew what it was. [\"You made yourself into a spectacle!\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3892) Queen Tam exclaimed. And so the cursed celebration began. Bijou and Peasant the Bae unveiled the sign Queen Tam had made, revealing the “gender” of the “baby.”\n\n[\"It's ~~gay~~ Gas!\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=3959)\n\nAll this… for a long, painful divine comedy about passing gas. Hot Pink Gas. The Queen didn’t even need to be there. And yet she and the voices in her head were forced to witness the “birth” of the “gassy baby”—Just [\"Carbonated Love\"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4071). Unsightly.\n\nDr. Mordan returned with more [sagely advice](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4128): Why not confront HPO’s consort and spill the beans about their secret relationship? Scorched earth. Why should Queen Tam be the only one to suffer? Might as well make everyone involved miserable. This therapist was truly something else. Everyone knows the drill. Instead of walking away and moving on, the Queen held the proverbial shovel firmly in her hands and dug deeper, choosing to confront the consort herself, NinoIna.\n\n[\"I want problems. Always.\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4247)\n\nThings took a turn when the Hot Pink One casually [dismissed Queen Tam as just a “hobby.”](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4381) It escalated into a duel, Queen Tam’s honor on the line. Her brave knight, Gonathon, ever loyal, stepped forward—ready to challenge the Hot Pink One, a literal goddess. The conditions were set, a gruesome one involving cutting open the HPO's stomach upon her defeat.\n\n[\"Gonathon the Godslayer.\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4835)\n\nAnd of course, Gonathon wiped the floor with the puny goddess, reclaiming his Queen’s honor—and perhaps his \"aura.\"\n\n\"You must fight in mortal terms!\" the brave knight yelled as he dealt the decisive blow.\n\nWhat followed was a [scenario so bizarre](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=4854) that one would struggle to put pen to paper to describe what exactly happened - gutting HPO like a fish, alcohol somehow being the real “baby,” and a C-section pun for good measure. But unlike Queen Tam, we move on.\n\n[From \"it's over\" to a romantic \"we're so back.\"](#embed:https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5044)\n\nOn the other end, Pinky was handling Tam’s judgment the only way she knew how—like a sulking child. She ignored her, pretended not to hear a word, avoided eye contact, and pouted in exaggerated silence. To Tam, it was nothing short of infuriatingly immature.\n\n[A fly is buzzing](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=8813)\n\nIt was getting really weird.\n\nWhat _was_ clear, though, was this: the bonds IRyS had cherished were crumbling. Tam had lost all respect for her. Her eternal consort’s affections seemed to waver—possibly drifting toward the blue lady. Even her brother had grown [distant](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=10224).\n\nSomething snapped.\n\nIRyS began to spiral. Love-blind, fogged with desperation. She would not lose them.

As Gonathon began reading, casually quipping about Mordan’s little “oopsies,” fate, ever fond of irony, brought Mordan herself to [appear in proximity,](https://www.youtube.com/live/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=1554) wandering near the tree unaware she was even being spoken of. She approached the chest she had left for Gonathon, confirming the book had indeed been received.\n\n[All is well in the kingdom](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=5211)\n\n“All is well in the kingdom.

In this life, where we only get so many chances to be with our friends, perhaps the best idea is to put aside selfish desires. Selfish desires? I’m being silly; I don’t feel those things. I don’t feel emotions. Only lust for money, fo-sho. Okay, maybe not lust for money, but definitely love for my pack.”\n\nIn a previous conversation between Mordan, Shiori, and Bijou, Mordan had not realized her purchase history was visible in the market chest. Her secret deed thus exposed, she eventually confessed to buying the book in error. And yet, one wonders, was it truly an accident? Or had Mordan, perhaps subconsciously, attempted to delay Gonathon’s receipt of it? As she reflected on all that had transpired since that moment, her lingering affections for her wolf brother Gonathon, not least among them, Mordan seemed to accept her lonely role in this tragic kingdom.\n\nAround the time of the new dungeon’s opening, during a kerfuffle among the heroes of Libestal, a small gesture towards Gonathon somehow led Mordan to even deeper despair. [Offering food to Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=7889s) in preparation for the upcoming battle, she was met with silence, leading her to believe that Gonathon was giving her the cold shoulder:\n\n“Gonathon doesn’t want anything to do with me.

That’s messed up.”\n\nA simple misunderstanding or miscommunication, perhaps, but for a heart already cracked by unrequited love and perceived rejection, the sting was undeniable.\n\n[From auctions to therapy sessions](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=13010s)\n\nMuch later in the day, both Mordan and Gonathon found themselves together once more, standing before the auction block as Tam Gandr recounted her latest romantic woes. Listening intently, Mordan and Gonathon offered what counsel they could. In a quiet gesture that betrayed her own wounded heart, Mordan offered Tam a “Gorgeous Ring,” the very same she had intended to give Gonathon only days prior.\n\nSensing the heaviness in Mordan’s voice, Gonathon gently sought to lift her spirits. Gonathon, along with Tam, reminded her of all she had built in this Libestal: her chef activities, her tavern, her therapy business, and now her business as a realtor. Gonathon considered Mordan the “most qualified person in this kingdom,” even proposing she learn medicine so that she might help during emergencies, referencing the recent chaos surrounding the Hot Pink One. With so few hands available in the kingdom, Mordan acknowledges being able to fit many kinds of roles for different circumstances.\n\nAnd yet, despite her many accomplishments, there was no denying that a sadness lingered in her heart. Mordan had been unsuccessful in love, unsuccessful in previously courting Gonathon, and uncertain in her role in the kingdom, and in turn left, hoping that others might find what she could not.\n\n[“Like all things, a broken heart can be mended”](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=16989) she said softly as advice to Tam. Perhaps, just perhaps, the advice she gave was not only meant for Tam but also for herself.",

Nonetheless, Bae pushed through. She waited by the bridge, letter in hand and roses ready. Finally, Bae gave Cecilia her confession. Bae watched patiently as Cecilia read her letter, the Kind Knight's voice faltering every so often. When Cecilia finished reading, Bae kneeled and presented her flowers, answering any question Cecilia asked her.\n\n[Yes, it is you.](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4740)\n\nThere was no need to mince words or prolong a painful moment: Bae's love was for naught, for Immerkind, though thankful for Bae's feelings, must follow her own heart for the princess. Cecilia will stay in Libestal. Perhaps, one day, she and Bae may meet again and then they can talk. They parted, once friendly companions now sorely strained.\n\nTo call it \"hurtful\" would be to downplay it. For Bae, it was devastating.\n\nShe had held back for so long—keeping herself closed off from others ever since the first journey. And now, when she had finally dared to hope, dared to feel something real for someone, dared to believe in warmth again… that hope had been crushed. That warmth turned to ice.

            "content": "[\"Nice to meet you.\"](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1769) It is a phrase all too familiar to Gonathon, whether she realizes it or not. Arriving at Shiori's house, Gonathon once again faced one whom she had previously loved, but now saw as a stranger. This time, Gonathon responded almost casually, a resigned sense of acceptance filling her voice as she conversed with Shiori. Expecting to find a book waiting for her, the amnesiac archiver responded in confusion, pointing the knight to Mordan Ramsey, who had bought the book by mistake.\n\nArriving home, Gonathon found a chest waiting for her with the book inside. The book directed her to a hidden site behind her tree, where a number of items related to Shiori's now removed memories could be found. While Gonathon collected these items, she did not have time to go over them. For Shiori of the Nyavellas was now requesting Gonathon's aid in the new farm area, and, determined to not let a chance to converse with her slip her by, eagerly agreed.\n\nArriving at the farming area, Gonathon once again met up with Shiori. Gonathon demonstrated her knightly prowess to Shiori by protecting her and mining items for her. Then, under the watchful eye of the moon, the two sat together and began to converse. Shiori revealed that she did indeed remember a form of Gonathon, her \"true\" self who the archiver simply referred to as \"G.\" Questioning why Gonathon was not with her usual friends and gang, the knight responded that she was still unsure of who she was, and what she wanted for her story.\n\n[The moon sure is pretty](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4171)\n\nWith the sun's playful rays beginning to peek out from the horizon, the conversation turned to memories. [Shiori remarked](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4297) that she preferred to seal painful memories away, rather than bear their burden. Gonathon retorted by stating that, regardless of whether Shiori remembered her or not, she knew the archiver was truly kind. Realizing the burden that Shiori bore as an archiver, Gonathon stated that no one could have the answer to everything, as this was a burden too great to shoulder alone. The conversation ended on a peaceful note, with Gonathon promising to fight by Shiori and the archiver wishing to meet the knight again.\n\nFollowing the epic clash with the Heart of Ruin, in which Gonathon assisted in purifying a curse placed on the archiver, and a jovial meal at Hot Pink One's party, Gonathon finally turned to the letters Shiori had left for her. The last words the witch had left for her thanked Gonathon for all the time they had spent together and implored the Humble Knight to live not just for the sake of others, but also for herself.\n\nMoved by Shiori's words, Gonathon thought back to her time with Bae (see [Bae-Gonathon](#edge:bae-gigi)) and decided that she, too, would set out on a journey of self-discovery. And with this, it seemed that the blank slate between archiver and knight was set to have a new set of memories etched upon it, free of the dark reminders of the past.\n\nAlas, this was not to be as Shiori uncovered the diaries from the previous days, their contents revealing the blackest depths of her encounters with Gonathon. Requesting that Gonathon speak with her, it appeared that history was set to repeat itself in the most tragic way imaginable. But it was here that the noble knight truly took her first steps towards a brighter future. Meeting face to face with the Archiver once more, Gonathon owned up to the sins she had committed and apologized for the way she had used Shiori as a means of escaping the pain of her lost love.\n\n[It was my fault](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/mb91g7vQSnA?si=UZkt8f46vWLuP6Do&t=12257)\n\nMost important of all for the Humble Knight was the kindness that Shiori gave her, both before and after losing her memories. Gonathon made one final request: that the two continue to speak like this. Departing on a melancholy but fulfilling note, the two promised to meet each other at the banquet tomorrow. And thus, the tale of the fumbling knight had ended. Where the story of Shiori of the Nyavellas goes next is unclear, but one thing is certain. Their story together is far from over.\n\n[I can't recall... but I can feel it](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/mb91g7vQSnA?si=tve9IVBF0HJBYQkK&t=12800)",

Just as Gonathon found himself caught in Shiori of the Nyavella's web of intrigue, so too did Tam find herself constantly pulled back to the false embrace of the Hot Pink One. But, while Gonathon had begun to reconcile and move towards a new future with Shiori, Tam remained imprisoned in HPO's [gaol of lies and sweet nothings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=4635s).\n\nTam began the day late to what would be the most important battle the adventurers had faced yet, but despite this, both queen and retainer committed themselves bravely to the defeat of the Heart of Ruin. It would not be much later that the two would reunite, and it would once again be in unsettling circumstances. For the heroes had, for whatever reason, put together a party celebrating the supposed birth of HPO's child, and the shameless goddess, high off the adoration of her companions, demanded that Tam submit herself once again into her service as [the child's godparent](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=7523).\n\n[Gonathon defies divinity for his queen](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=7568s)\n\nFinally, at her breaking point, Tam in no uncertain terms refused HPO's advances. Meeting with Mordan Ramsey and Gonathon, Mordan and Gonathon provided advice to the distraught queen, while also revealing the reprehensible depths of HPO's depravity in the number of wives she had taken. At the party, the narcissistic nephilim began taunting the queen, proclaiming she was simply a maid.\n\nEnraged by the treatment of the queen at HPO's hands (see [Irys-Gonathon: Even Gods Can Bleed](#edge:irys-gigi)), Gonathon once again [leapt into action](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=8983). In a stunning display of knightly skill and courage, the humblest of knights slew HPO in single combat, all for the sake of his queen's freedom. Having once again defended Tam's honor, the queen thanked Gonathon for his service.\n\n[A goddess slain, a queen redeemed.](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9277)\n\nLater, Gonathon met up with Tam at Mordan Ramsey's auction. Lamenting how poor she was, Tam's bitterness began to bubble to the surface. She [spilled her guts](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=12978) to Mordan and Gonathon concerning HPO's true feelings: the immoral imp had dismissed her and the queen's love as simply one of many flings, a mere footnote in the goddess's escapades.\n\nWronged for the last time, Tam confided in Gonathon and Mordan her plan: she would steal HPO's consort eternal, NinoIna, and drag HPO down to the depths of despair, just as the queen had been. Gonathon, ever loyal, promised to meet Tam early to assist in these plans. Before parting for the day, Gonathon reminded Tam that many respected her and that, once again, she should take pride in her status as Queen of Libestal.\n\n[The most resolute of knights](#embed:https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=13750)",

Over the course of the adventure in past Libestal, Gonathon had remained devoted to the Hot Pink One, believing her to be a goddess worthy of veneration. But even zealots can be pushed too far, and the HPO would soon learn this the hard way.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Heart of Ruin, much of the day was committed to the celebration of HPO's supposed child. However, it was not enough to have undeserved love and adoration heaped on her by all in attendance; the gluttonous goddess desired something more: for Tam Gandr to commit herself to being her child's godparent.\n\n[The therapist's advice](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=8206s)\n\nTam [adamantly refused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=7533s), but HPO persisted, dredging up horrific memories of the humiliation she had inflicted upon Tam as a means of humbling the battered queen. All of this was [too much](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=7566) for Gonathon G to bear; goddess or no, HPO could not treat his queen this way.

Leaping into action, Gonathon begged Bae to reconsider, and in between many bouts of kissing the depths together, Gonathon implored Bae to choose life, for as one whom love had also cursed, she knew all too well the pain of losing it.\n\nShocked and humbled by Gonathon's display of sacrifice all for her own sake, Bae finally came to an epiphany: that it was not romantic love that she would live for, but her children and her happiness.

Luring Immerkind to the fated bridge, the humble knight left the peasant to make her heartfelt plea. \n\nAlas, it was not to be, for the zealous green one was dead set on remaining in the past (see [Cecilia-Iphania: Loyal Knight's Vow](#edge:cecilia-iphania)). While she gave Bae the consolation that she would look for her in the future, this meager offering did little to mend Bae's heart, and the distraught peasant turned to [the embrace of the ocean's abyss](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4887). Leaping into action, Gonathon begged Bae to reconsider, and in between many bouts of kissing the depths together, Gonathon implored Bae to choose life, for as one whom love had also cursed, she knew all too well the pain of losing it.\n\nShocked and humbled by Gonathon's display of sacrifice all for her own sake, Bae finally came to an epiphany: that it was not romantic love that she would live for, but her children and her happiness. Most of all, she now knew she would not be alone in this quest; she had something far more valuable than a maiden to whisper her sweet nothings: a brother, one who would stand by her to the ends of the earth itself. [Bae bequeathed the flowers](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5214) once meant for Immerkind to Gonathon, and the two exchanged a hearty, manly handshake. They vowed that no matter what, they would always be there for one another, as true brothers. \n\nSome time later, [Gonathon paid a visit to Bae's hole](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=10130) and found the once spartan side room had been transformed into a lavish sanctuary for her children. It was here Bae told Gonathon that she would be leaving on a journey of self-discovery after this. These words touched Gonathon, and she too vowed to take up her own quest. \n\nIt is curious how the memories of HPO and Tam invoked a feeling of reveration for the wannabe god and queen in Gonathon, yet Bae's memories did little to sway her opinion of the peasant. But perhaps this was for the best, for it was through deed and experience that Bae and Gonathon were bound together. While the future for both remains murky, as brothers, they will see it through together.",

Perhaps it was this difference that made Roa's inevitable heartbreak all the more pitiful.\n\nThroughout the day, Roa continued her earnest pursuit—hopeful, determined, perhaps a little desperate. Yesterday's almost-confession still lingered on her lips, and today she tried again. She offered gifts, warned Elizabeth of Shiori's [suspicious behavior](https://www.youtube.com/live/m2OG5auudrQ?si=oX6O9t543B3Kn7Ha&t=2982), did everything she could think of to win over the elusive Red Knight.\n\nBut love, unfortunately, was not something Elizabeth seemed to recognize—at least not in the way Roa hoped.\n\nHer gestures were met not with warmth, but with blank stares. Tilted heads. Awkward silences. Roa's feelings, no matter how loud or heartfelt, simply didn’t reach her.\n\nBecause within the Red Knight’s heart… there was already [someone else](https://www.youtube.com/live/m2OG5auudrQ?si=Cgu4CvT-TAqFRUmK&t=4815).\n\nAnd for all the affection Roa tried to give, the only response she received was quiet confusion—never recognition.

The two spoke too fondly, in a tone Roa rarely heard from the Knight. Only then did Roa accept that her love would never be reciprocated in the way she had dreamed.\n\nDespite not noticing Roa's affections, the Red Knight [cared very much](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=453) for her comrade, showing concern whenever the cat feigned illness. Not once did Elizabeth doubt Roa's words; the trust she had in her was apparent.\n\n...Quite anti-climatic isn't it? Well, she immediately got married to another, in the same day no less (see [Shakira-Roa](#edge:raora-kiara))\n\nYay for happy ending?",

It had been a while since they caught up and chatted, and it felt nice and familiar since Nerissa had regained all her memories. Much to Shiori’s surprise, Nerissa had no problem with the memory she had given to the raven; she believed it had some truth to it. Unlike the knight Lady Bloodflame, she was not so hostile and quick to call Shiori a liar.\n\nWith this in mind, Shiori thought it best to tell Nerissa about the confrontation Lady Bloodflame had brought upon her. The blue raven did not know of the Scarlet Knight's actions, telling the two-toned witch that she did no wrong. In fact, one should not view Shiori so negatively for her memories as she had remembered them.\n\n**_Are you truly a witch?_**\n\nNerissa confirmed, indeed she was a witch. Unsure if she was one before, she knew now that this is who she is. If that is how the people perceive her to be, then a witch she shall be. The two witches agreed, the world is cruel. Thus, Shiori now had a fellow witch! How lovely to know that there is someone who shared much more in common than she once thought.\n\n**_The Covenant_**\n\nShiori offered Nerissa a pact—like a good neighbor, State Farm is there! They had both agreed, forming the first witch coven in Libestal. They would look out for each other, for their own kind. Both were open to recruiting other witches, the more the merrier! The two witches believed it would be beneficial to everyone, both glad they could come to such an agreement.\n\nAs they departed, Nerissa wished Shiori luck on her party planning, and Shiori wished Nerissa luck on her toxic yuri with the not-so-noble knight, Lady Bloodflame.",

It gave the place a vibrant, inviting charm—cheerful and fluffy, just like its owner.\r\n\r\n[Cafe complete!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9A1cO7jL0jw?t=2950)\r\n\r\nAnd just like that, it was done. Everything—_everything_—was complete. From having nothing to becoming the wealthiest; from being unknown to bringing smiles to countless faces with her cooking. Fuwawa had come so far, and she was endlessly grateful for everyone who had supported her along the way.\r\n\r\nStill, something tugged at her heart. A subtle feeling, hard to explain, but it centered on four others—Nerissa, Mococo, Bijou, and Shiori. There was something special about this group. A deep resonance. Enough for her to imagine them not as passing allies, but as something more—something lasting. A group, a bond, a chosen family that would weather all storms together.\r\n\r\n[Rebellion](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/9A1cO7jL0jw?t=3304)\r\n\r\nShe penned her [final diary entry](https://www.youtube.com/live/9A1cO7jL0jw?t=3729), wrapping up her journey in Libestal with warm memories and hopeful thoughts. That lingering feeling, though—about those four—would soon prove to be more than just a whim.\r\n\r\n(See [Princess–Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander))",

Other times, it sounded like a ticking time bomb she couldn't cut the wires of—and it was only getting louder each time...\n\n[BREAK A HOLE IN THE WALL!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/-vv8XkRzP_Y?si=eUBNUW75IS9WfTnU&t=581)\n\nShe knew that the others were going to worry about her.

Her sister, Elizabeth, pulled her aside to check on her ~~(and talk about [touching feet](https://www.youtube.com/live/-vv8XkRzP_Y?si=iXAkiwtkoJKM9kmh&t=1277)).~~\n\nMococo joined everyone in a [picture to remember! ](https://www.youtube.com/live/-vv8XkRzP_Y?si=2LGw4sR2aKf6GdFD&t=1682)Shortly after, she received her first flying lesson and took a [photo with Gacharms](https://www.youtube.com/live/-vv8XkRzP_Y?si=3LsvcJs-3dmLcsFd&t=1966)—and one more just by [herself.](https://www.youtube.com/live/-vv8XkRzP_Y?si=PoQVz0TTgHhBVXLD&t=2243)\n\nAs the sun set in the distance, the doggy jeweler found it hard to sleep.

Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame.\r\n\r\n[Spilled ink, soaked in sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=-HpFkakfPqE6y6EO&t=363). Written words of emotions across pages filled with lies. Fragile memories sold for coin. Works of a true witch.\r\n\r\nIf the ink speaks the truth, then [let me forget](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=9ftHdvHFDe7BKzLe&t=410). Let me live in a world where the truth is the lie and the lie is the truth.\r\n\r\nWhat is fear? Not for oneself, but for someone else. What quells the flame of concern?\r\n\r\nNerissa's possession of her body had instilled in me a fear that I was too late. Was purifying her enough? Had the time I spent calling her a witch caused so much damage that she turned?\r\n\r\nShe is the light of my flame. The flickers of emotions, the lick of heat against my skin. She is the rose above the thorns that cut.\r\n\r\n_\"What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other word would smell as sweet.\"_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs day breaks, Elizabeth seeks out Nerissa without hesitation. When the knock on the door goes unanswered, she moves to check the windows, disappointed not to see her present. A quick call remedies the situation.\r\n\r\nThey joke about the music, the looping track that still drives Elizabeth crazy. An invitation inside with a quick pass to hold the ring given to her days ago. Proof that she's not a witch—it's nothing more than a magic trick with looping discs.\r\n\r\nIn the back of her mind sits the warning from Kiara about apologies and corrections, yet her tongue sits too heavy to speak the words still.\r\n\r\nBack upstairs in Nerissa's home, she notes the roses and ring frame on the wall—gifts she had given. Taking the ring off the wall, Nerissa wears hers to match the one Elizabeth is wearing.\r\n\r\n_Promise rings. Nothing more._\r\n\r\nThen Nerissa requests a spar, something they've been doing daily now. And yet, Elizabeth makes an even stranger request: to go gambling (see: [Nerissa-Elizabeth: Finding Shelter in the Shadows of Hope](#edge:liz-nerissa)).\r\n\r\nBack at home, a [heart-to-heart with Kiara](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=oGPHYYz-3nlKro3Y&t=4582) reveals their shared nature as knights—both in thought and action. A reminder that Kiara is moving out is painful for Elizabeth, but she’s happy for her friend.\r\n\r\nBut Kiara doesn’t let things slide. She asks about Nerissa, about the blue that feels like it lights the flame of her chest. What is she to Elizabeth? A few [joke names](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=E3oALHLYZAo5suDE&t=4950) are tossed around: Princess of Blue, of Gambling, of Sound, of… Potato Salad?\r\n\r\n\"Princess of her heart,\" Kiara says.\r\n\r\nThe words catch Elizabeth off guard, but she doesn’t deny them. Red in the face, she tries to accept that Nerissa is just another person close to her heart.\r\n\r\nWith the chat with Kiara concluded, Elizabeth moves to find Nerissa once again, replicating something unique to them.\r\n\r\n[“Juliet, Juliet!”](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=wW_PnKZylMBJiFeK&t=5150)\r\n\r\nThough neither remembers the lines fully, it is a cheerful memory for them. Romeo and Juliet. Elizabeth and Nerissa.\r\n\r\nWith the banquet in mind, Elizabeth realizes she needs fireworks! Nerissa offers her paper and money to buy the gunpowder to make them. Quickly running to the castle store, she buys gunpowder and paper before returning to Nerissa again. Never too far from her side.\r\n\r\nWhen Nerissa gives her the paper, she starts to leave before running back to kiss her on the cheek and swiftly leaving. No words are said or given about the kiss, but it doesn’t seem to bother the knight.\r\n\r\nEven still, with the banquet closing in, Elizabeth wishes to stay and not return to the future.\r\n\r\nAnd moments before, Elizabeth asks Nerissa again, [“Are you okay?”](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=aVt1IOPOs86fL63N&t=6456)\r\n\r\nTo make it in time, Elizabeth uses magic and teleports for her princess to make it in time. And the banquet begins (see: [Princess-Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander)).\r\n\r\nElizabeth is shocked by Nerissa's change. She has sworn herself as a knight to the other. Will she bend the knee and break her word as a knight? Or will she give in once more to what seems to be corruption, as she had done for the king?",

Oh, it's [the Hot Pink One again](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=289). We're having a spat. They looked to be fine at first, but then the goddess magically disappeared from the Queen's eyes, becoming little less than wind—a rather noisy one.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of fresh air, Fuwawa, the blessing that she truly is in this world, shared some of [her wonderful cooking with Bae.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=390) Though Bae would have to wait to eat the tart, she was nonetheless enthused by the gift.\r\n\r\nAn auction! After days of preparation, Mordan Ramsey's auction was finally underway. Eyeing one house, Bae offered her price... [a joke!](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=637) All seemed jolly, but it seemed the occasion left Ina the Hero in a dour mood. In a grave _InaJustice_, [Ina's design](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=719), the architectural design of her own home, was stolen! The chef had copied Ina's house, from the bricks used to the window design. Seeing this unfold, Bae quickly stepped in and added a title to her name. (And another line to the _chart_.)\r\n\r\n[Lawyer The Bae](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=847)\r\n\r\nIt was a fierce case, fought bravely for less than 5 minutes. A totally proper, patented patent, not written on a scrappy piece of paper, changed the course of the trial. With this revealed, the chef went on a run... for a few steps. Since there was no court to truly prosecute a crime, it was but a silly moment for everyone.\r\n\r\nNow, time to remember this chapter with pictures!\r\n\r\n[Group Photo in the Library](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1190)\r\n\r\nShortly after the photo, Bae's two Promise members were still fighting. Bae watched as they walked while trading barbs and insults. To her shock, Bae learned that the Hero had [**_dumped_** the goddess.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1370)\r\n\r\nNot having one last group photo with her fellow suppliers would be amiss. Though Bae and Cecilia were still rather awkward after the rejection, they were still cordial. It was during their talk that Bae found out [there were only three suppliers](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1413) in the whole kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Bae's Vow](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1497)\r\n\r\n[Suppliers' Splendid Snapshots](#embed:https://youtu.be/IWNcqsQxuWo?t=5380)\r\n\r\nThey ventured back to where they first mined. It was a perfect spot to capture their last meeting before going their separate ways. Gonathon agreed; he might be a humble knight, but Bae's brother was a truly talented photographer. Capturing multiple angles, suggesting poses, and encapsulating the candid moments truly exemplified his experience with the camera.\r\n\r\nBae returned the favor, taking photos of Gonathon and his fellow pack in front of Mordan's Tavern... shortly after [Mordan's prank faded,](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1921) their [photo was taken.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2097)\r\n\r\nAs Bae left, one of the houses in the auction caught her eye. An interesting one, a 7LDK (seven bedrooms, a living room, dining room, and kitchen), was up for sale, though... [its roof seemed to be quite avant-garde](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2234) Shiori and Bae competed to buy the house before the writer remembered that Bae has kids now (one of whom was hers and Bijou's) and gracefully bowed out. But not before Bijou upped the price to 2,000 gold.\r\n\r\n[A Home to Return](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2357)\r\n\r\nAs the co-parents talked, Bae told them of her plans to finally leave this accursed Libestal and run back to the woods, this time bringing Khaos and Chaoz with her. There, Bae will teach [them the way of the Peasants.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2484) Truly, Bae is the Peasant Parent (PP) that stepped up.\r\n\r\nAs she went home to gather her kids to bring them to the banquet with her, Mococo came by to visit. The demon dog curiously looked over Bae's supplies and home. Still a supplier at heart, Bae would trade a few of the colorful fireworks, the same ones she painstakingly suffered to create, with Mococo.\r\n\r\nNow, with the kids in tow, Bae left the home that brought her much.\r\n\r\n[Bothering IRyS for the Last Time (in Libestal)](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2838)\r\n\r\nAfter destroying IRyS's property, breaking her jukebox, and setting off fireworks inside her shop, Bae finally questioned IRyS on what happened between her and Kronii yesterday. [Bae immediately doubted IRyS's answer,](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2984) knowing Kronii was mostly reasonable at times and IRyS was IRyS. Still, today was their last day, and amends would be attempted for a group photo. Bae extended the olive branch to her Queen, which was reciprocated.\r\n\r\n[The Promised Photo](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=3302)\r\n\r\nAnd of course, a final diary entry. A final message... GOODBYE LIBESTAL. With that, Bae was done.\r\n\r\nHuzzah! The banquet is here! Fireworks were shared and fired within range of flammable materials in an enclosed environment. Joy was had, and the celebrations resounded throughout the halls.\r\n\r\nAll was right!

Through the suffering she endured, her perseverance paid off: Roa finally achieved the happiness she sought. There was little Roa could add to make her life better. But, as she watched Mordan build another house for the auction, [the chef suggested](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=596) a new house for the newlyweds.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Roa was too broke to afford a new house. With the Gacharms' charms now obsolete, Roa turned to the jobs available. As she pondered by the Quest Board, Gonathon came by to congratulate her on her marriage. They traded pleasantries; Gonathon teasing Roa about her \"special night\" with Kiara, and Roa, in turn, asked if Gonathon had a special person in his life, to which he replied 'no.'\r\n\r\nNow with a wife to support, Roa was back in the Remnant Fields, fulfilling her quota per quest taken. There, Roa met Bijou, who mentioned experiencing a strange dream last night. One where strange creatures stayed in her head. Roa mentioned that she, too, had a similar dream. Perhaps the [memory commission](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=1027) Roa received from Shiori would offer some clues.\r\n\r\nRoa headed to Mordan's Tavern to meet Kiara and learned that there was a suite for the two of them. To celebrate their marriage and each other.\r\n\r\nA scenic view, flower petals scattered around, music to set the mood, and some nice drinks. Specifically, invisibility potions. Kiara also received her... special fanfiction from Shiori earlier:\r\n\r\n[Mamma Mia, this is too spicy.](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=2460)\r\n\r\n[##############](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=2627)\r\n\r\nTrue love is rather impure at times, some would say. What transpired in the tavern could be left to your imagination, and a description of any sort wouldn't capture the insanity of this... moment.\r\n\r\nAfter the romantic pet play passed between the two, they soon began a discussion about purchasing a home at the auction for their family. They toured the houses, noting which ones they liked, favoring the larger first house in particular.\r\n\r\n[A New House for 9,000 Gold!](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=4306)\r\n\r\nWith their efforts combined, Kiara and Roa won the auction for their dream house! Though the price was driven up by Bijou and, in her excitement, even Kiara herself.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, a day in Libestal would not be complete without a controversy of some kind, as the hero Ina accused Mordan of copying the architectural design of Ina's home and thereby profiting from Ina's intellectual property.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, to commemorate their journey, the heroes started taking pictures. Roa took one with [the whole group](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=4843) and another with her [Gacharms Co.](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=5136)\r\n\r\n[The Pink Panthera.](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=5271)\r\n\r\nA small moment of respite, Roa started reading the memory she obtained from Shiori. It told her of strange, Gatorade-colored, furry beings begging for jetpacks from their mama and their rather peculiar love of cucumbers and pineapple on pizzas.\r\n\r\nSince there was still time before the banquet was due to start, Roa spent a little bit more time with her friends, bonding with the Hot Pink One, purchasing some cake from Fuwawa's cafe, and adding some [decorations](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=5725) to her new home.\r\n\r\n[The One Happy Couple of the Story.](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=5924)\r\n\r\nA little [gacha](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=6977) didn't hurt either, since the money would be useless after today. She managed to win a few statues too, one of which was a familiar jade figurine.\r\n\r\n[A Gift to Elizabeth and Congratulations to Nerissa](#embed:https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=7124)\r\n\r\nAnd now to the banquet.\r\n\r\n(See [Princess–Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander))",

Even so, she wondered what to do with the money she had earned. Perhaps she could buy another ring and marry someone special, but she had long decided that married life wasn't one for the therapist.\n\nInstead, she thought that she should expand her hand-built neighborhood into a little town called [Mordanville.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=840)\n\n---\n\nINSPIRED OR COPIED?\n\nWith no more time to spare, Mordan started the bidding war for the three houses she had built. That is, before [home inspections revealed holes in the walls](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=4991), which Mordan immediately patched up.\n\nThe first house was a small one-bedroom property. Nothing too special. The bid started at 500 coins, and it went to Gonathon, her fellow wolf, for 2672 coins. The second one was slightly bigger. It was a 2LDK with a mini front yard. That one went to the couple in the front. (See: [Kiara-Raora: And so, Sesbian Lex.](#edge:raora-kiara))\n\nThe last house was the biggest of them all. It was akin to a mansion with seven bedrooms and--------\n\n[**_STOP THE AUCTION!_**](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=5528)\n\nA voice in the crowd commanded Mordan's attention. It was Bijou and her very own legal team. The jeweler accused Mordan of plagiarizing Ina's house; from the brick foundation to the stone rooftops, it was almost the same in look—which was definitely not true! Mordan called for the original patent of the purple one's house plan.\n\nThe patent that Ina soon showed seemed to be drawn on a napkin—something Mordan loudly mocked.\n\n_[“You look like a napkin!”](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=5648)_\n\nIn the end, Bae bought it for 2000 coins.\n\n---\n\nMordan knew that she would miss these moments with everyone, and she needed to cherish them the best she could. Thus, she took a picture with [the chefs](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?si=6XoSGMMzfTlRSZ0V&t=6193) and another with the rest of [the wolf pack!](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?si=uNJIZEhlu-vuZzXE&t=6784)\n\n[Last diary entry!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?si=uNJIZEhlu-vuZzXE&t=7627)\n\nAs fireworks lit up the twilight sky, the banquet had begun—but sadly, even laughter couldn't silence the fate that was fast approaching.\n\n(See [Princess–Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander))",

            "content": "A writer's work was never done; a book must end for another to begin and Shiori's script, too, will soon conclude. It is with this in mind that Shiori found herself writing once again, finishing her last commissions. Only a few remained—Kiara's rather [_suggestive_ fanfiction](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=553) and Roa's memory.\r\n\r\n[Read \"Kiara x Roa Snu\"](#text:kiara-roa-snu)\r\n\r\n[Read \"Cucumber\"](#text:cucumber)\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the newlywed couple's _spicy_ story, Shiori left for the Library to obtain another blank journal for Roa's memory. There, Shiori met her own wife, Bijou. They talk about how the banquet will be magnificent; nothing about it shall be dyed red, but if there will be red, it will be the red of love and hearts! Only trays of joy shall be served—not be*tray*als. [Things will be fine.](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=764)\r\n\r\nIn a quiet space, Shiori saw a memory; blue, furry, cat-like beings begging for jetpacks in her mind's eye. How they were upset when denied, but quickly rejoiced over the mention of cucumbers. She saw the bemused frown on the Pink Panther's face as she admonished the #########s. An occurrence that happened quite often to Shiori's amusement.\r\n\r\nWith commissions done, Shiori delivered each to their respective owners, earning a nice tip from Kiara. Kindness given deserves kindness in turn, so Shiori gave Kiara some of her own [home cooking](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=1548). From the start to near the end, the phoenix had been one of the kinder knights to Shiori, compared to two particular knight. Shiori enjoyed Kiara's company, taking the time to listen to Kiara fretting about her wedding knight and giving out suggestions: some vegetables are rather... _potent_.\r\n\r\n[It's the Heart, Not the Hips.](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=1615)\r\n\r\nThere wasn't much left for Shiori to do. A few quests and cooking filled was had. Shiori learned that Mordan would later host an auction for the houses she was building the past few days. The chef was certainly a better house-builder than a therapist, in Shiori's eyes. For a brief mischievious moment, Shiori considered pranking Mordan by placing some jukeboxes underneath the houses but dismissed the thought. Shiori Nyavella _was_ a kind witch.\r\n\r\nThe picnic with Cecilia was also rather nice, the two trading small talk over the _complicated_ relationships and resulting dramas. About how each person was the hero of their own story; it was their tale while others were but a part of it. Such as Roa attaining her own happy ending with Kiara after days of turmoil. Even the Hero Ina had [her own struggles](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=4091), Shiori accidentally eavesdropping as Ina wrote a letter to her own paramour. But in the end, they were part of a larger, grander epic.\r\n\r\nShiori's own tale was winding down. With her beloved Bijou, they watched Mordan's auction unfold. Friends bought houses to stay and build a new start to their lives. Shiori wondered if they should buy a house of their own, but Bijou refused. She looked at Shiori fondly, saying she was content and happy with the GothRock they already had. A tender moment that was briefly interrupted by another scandal: Mordan Ramsey was accused of intellectual theft by Ina. A scandal that was soon dropped since our heroes have limited run time.\r\n\r\n[A Memory to Save...](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=5266)\r\n\r\n[A Recipe for Recollection](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=5616)\r\n\r\nTheir time in Libestal wouldn't be complete without commemorative photos. One with everyone in the Library where their adventure started and another one with all the chefs together, giving their congratulations to Fuwawa's success afterwards.\r\n\r\nBijou popped out [from a hole](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6167) to Shiori's surprise. It was just a hole, albeit a rather deep one. One where the two conspired to possibly create a tunnel of love that could be used to prank others, hiding ticking noises to disturbed the residents that lived above the future tunnel. A prank they immediately hushed by Mordan's and Bae's arrival. Bae planned to buy one of the houses and though Shiori and Bijou first attempted to outbid her, both of them withdrawed, [remembering that Bae has kids now](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6411), one of which was their own. And they have visitation, though Bae would soon leave with the kids after the banquet to Shiori's surprise.\r\n\r\nAs one last prank, Shiori and Bijou sneaked into Mordan's Tavern where they criticized its lack of proper bedding. Their tresspassing was [soon noticed](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6716) but not to worry, since had their magic map. Soon the two of them met with with fellow witch Nerissa. The three of them agreed that three for a Witches Coven was not enough, [they can indoctrinate more](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6824) and add to their numbers. The Fluffy and Fuzzy Ones, in particular, were a splendid choice. Libestal was strange and chaotic land. And they can count on each to protect themselves. Though their memories, barring Shiori's, of before Libestal were fragmented, there was a... gravity that pulled them to each other.\r\n\r\n[Advent of Rebellion](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6938)\r\n\r\nThere were still a few things to remember from Shiori and Bijou's short stay. They lingered. Their GothRock shouldn't be remiss, it was a home that saw many moments. Even the outside toilet may be missed. And to make the [final entry special](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=7478), Shiori grabbed the diary in the latrine for that final smelly majestic use.\r\n\r\n[A Picture with ~~Gonathon~~ Gigi](#embed:https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=7270)\r\n\r\nFinally, the not-red banquet had begun! Shiori watched as everyone cheered as the second part of their journey was officially over, letting out \"Huzzahs\" and firing fireworks into the flammable decor of the Great Hall. She enjoyed the moment for just that. A moment. Jubilation and \"wooden shovels\" consumed the conversations Shiori could hear, though that didn't matter for long. Soon, Shiori Nyavella's role will end, and a new one will begin.\r\n\r\nA scream echoed through the castle, throughout Libestal.\r\n\r\nA malicious voice thundered through the halls.\r\n\r\n(See:[Outlander-Iphania](#edge:iphania-outlander)).\r\n\r\n**_Nothing Stays Pure_**\r\n\r\nIt was cute to see the heroes swear to try and save the world after failing... was it twice now? Pitiable. Shiori watched the Time Warden, or lovely _Queen Tam Gandr_ in this tale, promise Fia, the original _Iphania_, a brighter future. To try to overturn the Chains of Fate once more.\r\n\r\nWell, we can't have that now, can we? Repeating the same story so soon would be rather... stale. A good continuation needs a little change to set up a new arc with new challenges for our _beloved_ heroes to face. But like with every story, an antagonist is needed.\r\n\r\nEvery hero has a villain—be it herself, nature, or _another_.\r\n\r\n\"You think you can just set things right... Fix what's broken?\"\r\n\r\nShiori Nyavella tried her best to be kind to those around her; though she was a bit mischievous at times. Some appreciated her kindness, but there are those the Archiver's eyes lingered on a few of Shiori's... former friends; there are those who were un*JUST*ly cruel to Nyavella.\r\n\r\nHer eyes glowed as she turned to the three goddess-like beings, avatars who were part of a Council that became a Promise, who stood against Advent. Her gaze caught, and she smirked. It looks like her little coven of witches, Shiori's Advent, _won't_ be quite alone in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n**Bonds** forged yesterday are now **broken** today.\r\n\r\n**_\"Who's...

This would be the final day she would spend with them before they all returned to the future. A bittersweet farewell loomed on the horizon.\n\nBut the day itself? It was beautiful.\n\nShe shared pleasant, heartfelt moments with her friends, including a lighthearted [picnic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyufI3aiCB0&t=1301s) with Shiori. Laughter, warm food, fresh air—it felt like peace. Yet, even in such serenity, Cecilia discovered that the Hot Pink One had been [slandering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyufI3aiCB0&t=2940s) her name behind the scenes. The sting was there, but it couldn’t dim the brightness of the day.\n\nLater, Gonathon fulfilled a promise that had long been in the making. From Mordan’s house auction, they secured Cecilia a home—a gift, a symbol of their bond. Together, they stepped inside its empty halls, letting their imaginations roam as they decorated the space in cheerful daydreams. It wasn’t just a house. It was a future—one Cecilia had never let herself hope for.\n\n[New House!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/LyufI3aiCB0?t=3272s)\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, Cecilia prepared for the final banquet.

There was laughter, closeness, a warmth that wrapped around her like a favorite song. It was everything she'd ever wanted—a storybook ending.\n\nYes, the journey had been long, chaotic, emotional. But she had made friends. She had found meaning. And, for a time, she was happy.\n\nAnd so, as the final banquet began, Cecilia promised herself one thing: she would enjoy it to the fullest.

Awake in the dead of the night, [staring back at her portrait](https://youtu.be/MXqotm_8_Hc?t=228), entranced, she drowned in the deafening silence of a seemingly peaceful evening. Deep within, there was a storm brewing. All that pain she suffered from unrequited love... the anxiety that crawls into every bit of her nerves… The jealousy that stabbed her in the back gradually coalesced to form a maelstrom that could wreak havoc on anyone who stood in her way.\r\n\r\nShe was ready to exact revenge.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**BLOOD IN THE BREEZE**\r\n\r\nBreaking from her own \"spell,\" she went about her way, [killing the remnants of the Stains](https://youtu.be/MXqotm_8_Hc?t=483) that were left after the salvage of Libestal, destroying everything that came across her. Even an innocent cow was not spared from this woman’s rage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**GAMBLING WITH FATE?**\r\n\r\nOf course, nothing was more satisfying than spending time gambling after a hard day’s work. It was like opium—a drug that excited all her senses. The risk of losing and gaining had been quite the hobby for her. Much like losing oneself in the name of love. This time, it seems, it had become stronger than ever before.\r\n\r\nShe placed her lot—first, on all colors except blue. Although there was more to it than merely placing one’s bets. For she talked with the voices more audibly now that it did not matter if someone heard her. And her words… sounded deep and allegorical as she compared the persistence of colors at the strike of luck with how one persists in the hands of fate.\r\n\r\n_“What is it you’re hoping for?”_\r\n\r\nNerissa felt rather than heard the words, her eyes fixated, determined, ahead. The color cannon was now loaded, and the voices continued to rise in volume as they placed their bets on the last surviving color… Inwardly, she argued and questioned why, despite all impossibility, some voices still insisted on asking for \"red.\" Why, after all, keep holding onto hope? Why keep praying for miracles? When blue is inevitable. A destiny that could hardly be defied.\r\n\r\nAnother round went by; the voices continued to risk everything for the slightest chance of victory, while Nerissa kept denying herself any form of optimism, fully convinced that she could not escape her fate… that she did not need any saving.\r\n\r\nBut what if salvation comes in the color of scarlet? Brave. Persistent. Full of hope.\r\n\r\nHer telekinesis device rang. It was a call from Lady Bloodflame. The fair knight asked her whereabouts, and as soon as she learned where, she immediately went up to meet her. As if providence was trying to prove the “Witch” wrong, “Red” stormed in to snatch her away from despair.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**LIKE A BURNING SUN**\r\n\r\nElizabeth came, and a light flickered in the jet-black room in her heart. That tiny flame, could it consume the darkness clouding her soul? The fair knight kept coming closer, and every time it felt like a scorching sun burning through her skin. It was not pleasant; thus, she tried to remain cold and distant. Unreciprocating her advances.\r\n\r\nWill she truly be able to resist the knight's sweet gestures? Or would she finally show weakness and yield to her first love? (see: [Nerissa-Elizabeth](#edge:liz-nerissa))\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**RENEGADES**\r\n\r\n“_It seems like everyone is getting their happy ending_,” Nerissa muttered.\r\n\r\nHer feelings were rather ambivalent, as if perhaps she was unsure about her own ending. Was it malice, forming deep within her heart? Or maybe it was uncertainty, the victory over the Heart of Ruin feeling unsatisfactory or incomplete to her? There was something odd about it all, afterall. All the clues she had gathered seemingly pointed to a different direction. Perhaps that last tome might have held more answers, if only she could have deciphered its obscure language.\r\n\r\nOne thing was for certain, however- something was wrong, and it was up to her to act on it.\r\n\r\nRight before the victory banquet started, Nerissa [met up with Shiori Nyavella who happened to be with Princess Bijou](https://youtu.be/MXqotm_8_Hc?t=7518), who then claimed to have just become a witch. The jeweler expressed her desire to learn more from them, and the two were \"kind\" enough to accept her as apprentice. Shiori inquired if it would just be the three of them, to which Nerissa replied perhaps they could recruit two more. Thus, they called the Fluffy One and the Fuzzy One, for certainly, no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nFrom henceforth, they shall be called \"Coven Rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nWould this coven be just another harmless faction? Or would they be a threat to the renewed peace in Libestal?\r\n\r\n(see [Iphania-Outlander](#edge:iphania-outlander))\r\n\r\n## Fan Arts\r\n\r\n[\"naow\" by Chaku](https://x.com/DiChwis12652/status/1922518834847625230)\r\n\r\n[\"-Advent-\" by Haaro](https://x.com/haaro_69/status/1922094444339462652)\r\n\r\n[Untitled by BRASILEIRoo0](https://x.com/BRASILEIROO0/status/1923024077683347585)",

Though, surprisingly, new bonds formed as well.\n\nIt wasn’t a day without some [eavesdropping](https://www.youtube.com/live/C6kmnHsopgM?si=avfoBgSKUq9BJzvQ&t=268) either. She had woken up on Shiori’s bed again, coming off a dream about watching Pokémon movies. Shiori was already up, writing someone’s commission in the center of the room. Bijou warped away just as she finished to avoid getting caught.\n\nShe comes across Shiori anyway in the Library. They theorize what may happen at the banquet; surely nothing bad will happen, right? …Right?\n\n[Would be a shame if something happens](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/C6kmnHsopgM?si=AMA62ai2XxdOzql9&t=610)\n\n---\n\nBijou realized she had not completed the Library’s lore archives for herself, so she set off to collect the books she had missed. She was essentially taking a walk through memory lane through the areas the warriors had wandered this past week. Upon collecting them all, she started reading them out loud to herself and the voices in her head.\n\nImmerkind also came by while she was reading. The delusional knight was fully aware that they would leave this point in time soon. Bijou assures her that everyone’s memories of each other, the Libestans, and the adventures of the past week will be remembered.\n\nThat was her reasoning for collecting all the books she could find, after all.\n\n[Reading the Library Lore Archives](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM)\n\n---\n\nLater on, Bijou happened to stop by the Hot Pink One’s house, [overhearing](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=3830) a talk between her and Immerkind. Seeing her at the door, HPO immediately asked why she was next to… “the murderer” (Mococo was next to her outside, referring to yesterday’s “incident”).\n\nAs if the trauma of yesterday wasn’t enough, the HPO got a letter… from her consort. Queen Tam also showed up at this time, though IRyS [demanded](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4028) that her brother stay away from her.\n\nBijou started to feel suffocated in the tense atmosphere. She clutched her map to cope, but even that didn’t feel like enough. As if by magic, the appearance of the fluffy one was able to calm her down. Her presence alone was able to soothe her.\n\n[Headpat me! Headpat me!](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4066)\n\n---\n\nOne [auctioning session](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4531) later, Mordan also had the bright idea of taking a group photo before the banquet, anticipating the end of their time in Past Libestal.\n\nTheir first stop was the **Library**, where this chapter started. Without Fia, they would not have been saved from the false Libestal and taken back in time. Bijou was called out for being short and thus was put front and center. She was the one to take the picture though!\n\n[A photo for the archives](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5062)\n\n---\n\nBijou then called the jewelers for a group photo at [Gacharm](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5232). Though it was Roa’s business in the end, the sparkling gem pulled a lot of weight on her own. She developed the gacha ticket system, and she worked tirelessly to craft and mine for the charms they sold. Arguably, the success of the business came from her—the literal jewel of the company.\n\n[Tiny treasures, infinite pleasure!](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5552)\n\n---\n\nThe time of the banquet drew closer.\n\nA brief detour after led Bijou and down a [random hole](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5970) someone seemed to have dug down. They went further down and were surprised by how far down they could reach. Shiori noticed this too. She theorized a plan for the future to make a secret tunnel system under everyone’s homes. Perhaps for another time, on another adventure.\n\nSince everyone was busy taking pictures, Shiori and Bijou [visited the tavern](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6508) one last time. It was only cut short as Mordan drew near. Though they didn’t get to see The Basement, their bond seemed to have improved from their short visit.\n\nSoon after, Shiori got a call from Nerissa to meet up. They do so near the wagon. Now, as a member of her coven, Bijou expresses great eagerness to learn her witchy ways sometime in the future.\n\nIt was brought up that they could try [recruiting](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6725) some innocent ones. Fuwawa and Mococo came to mind immediately. Fuwawa’s worth as a chef was proven near the end of the week, while Mococo was all about the money from the start.\n\nArguably, they could use a little guidance. The fluffy and fuzzy ones were summoned, and together they all formed an alliance. From that day forward, they all vowed to protect one another. The Coven “Rebellion” had been formed. The voices in their heads stirred, almost as if this particular group of five was destined to be!\n\n[An **Advent** of something new…](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6784)\n\nTo commemorate this moment, they took a [group photo](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6895) together; they were among one of the last to gather for one. Tam, Immerkind, and Gonathon helped take photos for them as well.\n\n_”The banquet will begin in 5 minutes.”_\n\nNow of their own coven, Shiori and Bijou said their farewells to the Building Area, and by extension their house. Bijou decided to carry her egg and one of Shiori’s seeds with her.\n\nShe took a pit stop at the outhouse before they left for the banquet. …But she took this as an excuse to “love maps” one last time, overhearing a photo op between Gonathon and Shiori. Even as she was summoned to the Great Hall, she decided to sneak in [one last journal entry](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=7324) and a selfie with her knight Immerkind before leaving.\n\n---\n\nThe banquet was finally about to happen. The warriors gathered at the [Great Hall](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=7428), practically jumping in their seats in excitement. Everyone said their last goodbyes in advance; for Bijou, she bid farewell to her sister.\n\n…This was their final moment of peace. Their celebration would be interrupted by divine forces beyond their control.\n\n(See [Outlander-Iphania](#edge:iphania-outlander))\n\n---\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\nNothing stays pure forever, they say.\n\nOur innocent former princess… may not be so pure after all, after what she’s gone through this past week. _...So much for reform._\n\nWe’ll see what the next chapter brings.\n\n[M̷͕͎̤͔̒̄͗́͊͝ͅā̵̧̺̙̞̭y̷͕̐ ̶̫̺̝̥̐͗̃͑̀͝t̷̯̦͔̥͉̋̈́͘h̴͕͐̀̅̚͝e̵̛̬̲̙̠̜͗̏̈́̑̄ ̵̨̨͉͈̩͍̐͊͛l̴̩͇͒́̿̓͘͜͝ǎ̷͓̙̬͕̝͉͆̈́̊̄̓n̵̙̻͒̈́̐͐d̴̲̬̊s͕̱̫̘͓͕̼͍͙͐ ̶̫̺̝̥̐͗̃͑̀͝b̶̥̅͛̆͑͘̕u̵̩̩̣͙͎͊̾r̸̹͉̳̯̙̹͛̅̈̐͗͂n̸̡̦̜̎̈́͝](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=8151)",

            "content": "**Justice is Blind**\n\nThe day started almost eerily calm for the Humble Knight. With a few hours to burn before the victory banquet, Gonathon busied himself by unearthing the final tomes of lore that still eluded her abount the kingdom. His thoughts drifting back to Immerkind , Gonathon decided that the best way he could help his lovesick friend was to win a house for her in Mordan Ramsey’s upcoming auction.\n\nSwiftly winning the auction and gifting Immerkind the house, the two shared a heartfelt conversation in which they once again reaffirmed the vows of the pack. They were quickly joined by Tam Gandr and Mordan Ramsey, and, following a rousing rant by the queen on their victory over the Hot Pink One, [the wolf pack gathered all of its members for a final photograph](https://www.youtube.com/live/IWNcqsQxuWo?si=Px7ylmWgbXcz0b0J&t=5630), a memento of the unbreakable bond they shared.\n\nFollowing one last adventure to collect lore with Tam and Immerkind, Gonathon encountered Elizabeth and Roa. Despite Roa, Liz, Immerkind, and Gonathon having no discernible link in this world, the four could not deny the innate kinship they felt and decided to take a picture together, proclaiming themselves [the Knights of Justice](https://www.youtube.com/live/IWNcqsQxuWo?si=hHBQWw5ZJWqYlvRD&t=6812).\n\nAfter that, Gonathon paid a visit to Shiori of the Nyavellas (see [Gonathon-Shiori:](#edge:gigi-shiori)). Face-to-face once again with the one who he had shared so many memories with, Gonathon shared one final conversation and took a photograph with her, a melancholy but optimistic final note on their adventures together. Or at least, that’s what it appeared to be.\n\nAs Gonathon entered the banquet hall, he was approached by the Outlander, who thanked him for all the work he had done. The mysterious cloaked figure revealed [his secret identity as the Watcher](https://www.youtube.com/live/IWNcqsQxuWo?si=QUzhHUS977EJwG4c&t=7325) and earnestly proclaimed why he wanted to save Princess Iphania, his beloved “sister.” Alas, as if on command, a shrill scream was heard.\n\nRushing to the scene, Gonathon was horrified to find the princess and the Curse—seemingly no worse for wear following their previous battle—was standing over her corpse. The malignant entity taunted Gonathon before fleeing, leaving the shaken knight to parse what had just occurred.\n\nMeeting with the mysterious Fia, Gonathon was struck with yet another shocking revelation: that the catlike being was in fact Princess Iphania! Setting aside the question of how Shiori could have known about Fia's secret identity, Gonathon vowed to fix the world he had come to love alongside his companions and forge his own path into the future.\n\nBut the question was, would these companions stand alongside him? For upon regrouping with the other adventurers, the most stupefying twist of all was revealed: Fuwawa, Mococo, Nerissa, Bijou, and their leader Shiori had turned their backs on the cause they had fought so hard for and had going rogue. Locking eyes with Shiori, the Archiver offered yet another seemingly simple choice: [“Are you with us?”](https://www.youtube.com/live/IWNcqsQxuWo?si=DDxWY6Ijue3gNRMc&t=7711)\n\nSo ends the second journey of Gonathon G. Throughout his many trials, the Humble Knight has learned the importance of choosing his own path and not simply living as the mindless pawn of others. Despite losing the memories of the one he held most dear, Gonathon remains committed to fighting for what he believes in. But now, with many of his friends, including the one who showed him so much kindness, seemingly standing against the cause he had fought so long and hard for, will the Humble Knight be able to stand firm? Or will he succumb to the temptations offered to him by these malefactors and sink to even greater depths?",

(see [Hot Pink One–Ina: So Long, Consort](#edge:ina-irys))\r\n\r\nThe [lingering tension](https://www.youtube.com/live/kwmxMSD8tTU?t=1098) from the previous day with Tam also hadn’t dissipated. In fact, it only escalated.

Instead, she spent her final hours in the kingdom wandering, sharing light moments with the others.

            "content": "The Queen woke up with fire in her heart and vindication in mind. It was _on sight_ for the Hot Pink One, and she wasted no time telling Immerkind that it was, in fact, HPO who had spread rumors about her being [“far from kind”](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=264) right from day one. Naturally, the kind knight took offense and immediately started grilling the Hot Pink One. The Queen took this distraction as an opportunity to read a letter she’d received from Nino Ina. There was nothing like reading a heartfelt letter while your enemy was getting flamed in the background.\n\nBut alas, one could not win it all. NinoIna chose not to take up the Queen’s offer to leave HPO and be with her—for NinoIna did not wish to stray from [the path of a righteous hero](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=296). The Queen looked up at the sky exasperatedly, let out a deep sigh, and began taking out her frustration on HPO once more, who had somehow managed to save face with Immerkind. To this, the Queen remarked,\n\n[“You couldn’t save OUR relationship now, could you?!”](#embed:https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=342)\n\nOne squabbling session later, Tam decided to take part in the auctioning event.\n\nPeople say bravery requires one to be afraid of doing something but do it anyway despite the fear. Whatever possessed the Queen, it certainly was not bravery when she placed a bid of [ten thousand coins](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=785) at Mordan Ramsey’s auction—despite only having a little over a thousand to her name. Perhaps it was her newly regained bravado after her perceived triumph against HPO. Or maybe it was just good old-fashioned fear of missing out on flaunting her authority. The latter seemed more likely, as she backed out the moment it became clear she might actually _win_.\n\nWhile checking out the new home that Immerkind and Gonathon had won from the auction, Queen Tam brought them up to speed on NinoIna’s response—her decision not to be with either the Queen or HPO. This, in a technical sense, handed the win to Queen Tam, since HPO was now fated to live alone. An [empty and petty win for a petty queen](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1052). But one thing she _did_ have that HPO didn’t was the camaraderie and undying support of her fellow wolves in “the Wolfpack.” And so, she, Immerkind, and Gonathon howled in unison.\n\n[“Take a gander at my pettiness.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1261)\n\nNext on the Queen’s agenda was a photoshoot with the other heroes who had helped save the world. Naturally, this included the Hot Pink One—and the Queen wasted no time engaging in their usual routine of shenanigans. She wanted the chair HPO was sitting on. She also remarked about the Hot Pink One having no one left by her side, all while [laughing evilly](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1446).\n\nAfter that came a photoshoot with her [fellow Suppliers](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1774)—Peasant the Bae and Immerkind—courtesy of Gonathon. It was then that the Queen realized there were only three of them in the group. This was followed by yet another shoot, this time with her fellow wolves in the Wolfpack: Gonathon, Immerkind, Shakira, Mordan Ramsey, and Nerissa. They shared their [final howls](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2252) together as Peasant the Bae snapped their photo.\n\nPerhaps driven by a lingering sense of adventure—or simple curiosity about the Kingdom of Libestal in this timeline—Queen Tam formed one last adventuring party with her trusty knights Immerkind and Gonathon. Together, they ventured into the [Remnants of the Antigonian Aerie](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2481) to search for ancient tomes chronicling the kingdom’s lost history. Midway through their journey, the Queen received a [“spam letter\"](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2587) from the Hot Pink One.\n\nAs they continued their small quest, Immerkind and Gonathon began discussing their hopes for the [next grand adventure](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2760): saving Libestal’s griffins from extinction. Gonathon even suggested traveling further back into the past to do just that. The Queen, on the other hand, just wanted to go home. After all, she likely had better things to do than save some random majestic creatures.\n\n[“I... I would love to go home.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2810)\n\nOn their way back to the kingdom for the victory banquet, Queen Tam stumbled upon an [unusual gathering of people](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3089) having their pictures taken: Shiori, Nerissa, Bijou, the Fuzzy One, and the Fluffy One. As far as the Queen knew, the only thing these people had in common was that they’d all been cursed to fight the heroes in the final dungeon and had to be freed from corruption.\n\nStrangely, this inspired Immerkind to do the same. She and Gonathon sent messages to Roa Pandora and Lady Bloodflame, inviting them to take photos [“for justice,”](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3170) as Gonathon put it.\n\nThen the Queen felt it too—deep in her heart, or perhaps from the abyss where the rest of her missing memories lay dormant—[a strong urge to gather Peasant the Bae and even the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3218) to capture their moment as well. The feeling must’ve reached Peasant the Bae too, because she was already calling the Queen with the same idea.\n\nAnd so, on a deserted street—against a backdrop of the vast blue sky fading into space, the lush greens of nature, and the majestic structures of a thriving civilization—the three had their group photo taken.\n\n[“…a promise to keep forever.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3460)\n\nAt last, it was time for the victory banquet. There, Queen Tam and the others enjoyed [fireworks supplied by Peasant the Bae](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3675). The sense of accomplishment was palpable, and spirits were high as the celebration commenced. Soon, the Outlander stepped forward to personally thank each hero for their bravery—for saving him and the kingdom from their grim fate.\n\nThat was when the gears of destiny started again, and the fate of the heroes reached a turning point. (see: [Outlander-Iphania: The Chains of Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander)).\n\nQueen Tam Gandr could scarcely believe what was unfolding before her. Just as a newfound determination to save the world stirred in her chest, a betrayal cracked the bond the heroes had built. And as the [advent of seemingly wicked intentions](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=4199) came from the five individuals who sought to rebel, the Queen felt her strength drain from her body—and was claimed by slumber once more.\n\nOnly time will tell when the Queen shall rise again.",

And so she extended her hand, asking them to stand with her in one final fight—to defy the impossible, and to create a future beyond fate’s design.\r\n\r\nMost of them answered her call.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nBut not all.\r\n\r\n[Nothing stays pure forever](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?t=7224)\r\n\r\nFuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori did not.\r\n\r\nSomething had changed within them. A darkness stirred, quiet at first, now fully bloomed. The warmth they once carried, the joy they once spread—it had twisted into something colder, sharper. A fire not of hope, but of rejection. They had no interest in saving the world nor the Outlander. \"Eventually, the people you trust... the people you admire... they all turn on you.\"\r\n\r\nThey were done trusting. Done hoping. They would forge their own path—one shaped not by fate, nor by gods, nor by promises. They declared it proudly.\r\n\r\nA rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnd they welcomed anyone who might wish to join them.",

As the heroes celebrated their hard-won victory over the corruption at the banquet, the Curse—somehow still alive—struck again, emerging from the shadows to slay Princess Iphania.\r\n\r\nBefore the heroes could react, a mysterious and cryptic being appeared—one that seemed to shatter time and space itself. It condemned the Outlander and the heroes for defying fate, asserting that their actions went against the grand design.\r\n\r\nBut just as it prepared to strike them down, Fia intervened. She pulled the heroes into another time leap within the Library, narrowly escaping the entity’s wrath.\r\n\r\nHaving now recovered all of her memories, Fia revealed a painful truth: in her past life, before becoming the keeper of the Library, she had been Iphania. She too had met a tragic fate. The Curse had hidden a fragment of itself inside her beloved doll, waiting patiently until the moment of triumph to reemerge and take her life. But before she fully perished, her soul fused with the doll, allowing her consciousness to persist. Drifting through time and space, she eventually arrived in the Library, becoming its keeper.\r\n\r\nNow, knowing the past could no longer be changed, Fia resolved to shift her focus to the present—and the future. She declared her intent to face the Outsider head-on and asked the heroes to stand with her once more.\r\n\r\nMost agreed. But **Mococo**, **Fuwawa**, **Bijou**, **Nerissa**, and **Shiori** refused. As if once again touched by the Curse, the five broke away, rejecting Fia’s plan and declaring they would follow their own path instead.\r\n\r\n#### Updated NPCs\r\n\r\n- See [Fia](#node:fia)\r\n- See [Iphania](#node:iphania)\r\n- See [Outlander](#node:outlander)",

The eyes that once sparkled at the sight of the fair knight were dimmer, no longer full of the luster of a maiden freshly in love.\n\nThe Red Knight was not completely clueless to the changes in her demeanor, however. Once again, [she noticed the strange device](https://youtu.be/b-jTHH6GK5w?t=980) in Nerissa's home had been playing all night, so she set out to investigate. Realizing that Nerissa was absent, she immediately called her. In response, Nerissa confirmed she was at the Lucky Lounge and agreed to meet up with her to stop the underground music.\n\nSpending the day together, Lady Bloodflame tried to improve her connection with Nerissa, suggesting they could play the lucky game together first. The Raven agreed, and together the pair bonded once more, though their feelings and fates were now just as intertwined with their gambled fortunes.\n\n[\"Maybe you are my lucky blue.\"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=SGFe8V8u909-nM1L&t=2025)\n\nWould red persist and rekindle their mutual flame?

But what seemed to be a simple promise to meet again before departing the past Libestal together would soon prove to be much more ominous than Gonathon could possibly imagine.\n\nFor much of the day, Gonathon and Shiori were perplexingly separate from one another, with Gonathon busying herself with collecting lore and assisting Immerkind with securing a home, and Shiori conversing with others and staying close to her home. It was only as the banquet drew near that Knight and Archiver would reunite, with Gonathon requesting a [picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWNcqsQxuWo&t=6859s) of just the two of them. Departing for the time being, the two agreed to meet up at the victory banquet.\n\nFollowing the horrific slaying of the Princess Iphania at the banquet, the heroes once again encountered Fia the cat. It was here that a shocking revelation was made: that Fia was in fact the Princess! This in turn raised a foreboding question: were Shiori's comments about the princess and Fia being one the previous day a mere coincidence, or did the archiver know more than she was letting on?\n\nResolving to do whatever it took to fix the world, Gonathon and her companions seemed set to embark upon a new journey... that was until five sinister figures made their presence known. Now standing in opposition to their former friends, Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and their leader, Shiori of the Nyavellas, unmasked themselves as malefactors. It was here that Shiori presented the heroes with a question: [\"Who's with us?\"](https://youtu.be/IWNcqsQxuWo?t=7795)\n\n[The line is drawn.](#embed:https://youtu.be/IWNcqsQxuWo?t=7747)\n\nAnd with this, the second chapter of Gonathon and Shiori's stories came to a close. With these sudden revelations, several quandaries begin to surface. Did Shiori remove her memories to spare herself the pain of them, or was it to prepare herself for her betrayal of Gonathon? Would Gonathon be able to resist the Archiver's offer, given the oath she swore to her? And who exactly was this \"G\" that Shiori claimed was another version of Gonathon?\n\n## Fanart\n\n[\"BROKEN BONDS\" by harutimu](https://x.com/harutimu_415/status/1921663069068906634)",

And for the longest time, he accepted that.\n\nBut then, he met Princess Iphania.\n\nDespite the overwhelming despair that surrounded her kingdom, she never gave up. She defied fate, fought to her last breath, and inspired hope in even the most desolate hearts. Her unwavering resolve moved the Outlander, and he began to question everything he believed in.

But a question lingered in his mind: how did they know all this? How did they seem to already understand the truths he had just now revealed?\n\nHe never got an answer.\n\n[A small talk before the turning point](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?t=6695)\n\nTheir conversation was shattered by a sudden, piercing scream.\n\nRushing to the source, they found Iphania collapsed on the floor—lifeless.

The fact that Fia, the doll, was once Iphania’s beloved companion before mysteriously gaining “sentience.” Even Shiori had managed to piece it together long before the truth was revealed.\n\nStill, the revelation came amidst tragedy. Yet even then, the Princess’s resolve never wavered. She was determined—to save the world, the universe, and the ones she held dear.\n\n(see [Iphania–Outlander](#edge:iphania-outlander))",
