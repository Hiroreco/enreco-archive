A crazy red woman? Whatever she was didn’t matter—her mere presence was enough to plunge everything around her into chaos. She was energetic, she was powerful, she was chaos itself. With a roll of her dice, reality bent to her will, granting both her and those around her whatever wishes they desired.",

        "info": "### Description\n\nReleased on May 3, 2025, *MONSTER* is the official theme song for the second chapter of **ENigmatic Recollection**, featuring Gigi, Ina, Kronii, and Shiori.\n\nAn intense electronic rock track infused with disorienting, jazz-inflected harmonic instability, it perfectly captures the project’s chaotic, high-stakes lore. Lyrically, it explores the **erosion of identity** and the struggle to confront the **inner “monster”**—not an external enemy, but the darkest, fragmented side of oneself screaming from within.\n\nVisually speaking, the song is strikingly well-animated, filled with subtle symbolism tied to the overarching story of the second chapter—most notably, the final sequence where four cards representing the heroes are shown, and only Shiori’s is turned over, by her own hand.",

As she reminisced and reflected, her thoughts grew deeper and more contemplative—about herself, about those around her, and above all, about what it truly meant to be a knight.",
