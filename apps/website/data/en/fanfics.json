And there was definitely nobody in particular that the Grim Reaper had ever explicitly thought about marrying and/or running a restaurant with, despite the name the persistent, cheeky little skeleton voices in her head kept throwing out at her.-A tournament to win the hand of Libestal’s most eligible tavern keeper is brewing, with plots, conspiracies, and shenanigans aplenty. The problem is, no one actually bothered to consult Calli about it.Being an unwilling tournament prize is the least of her troubles, though. As she and Kiara navigate a strange dungeon in the wastelands, Calli is faced with memories of a past life she’d rather forget. Now, she must unravel the painful truth of why Reapers can’t fall in love in order to rewrite her destiny.A tale spanning two lifetimes: a romantic tragedy, and a comedy of errors in which true love eventually prevails.",
