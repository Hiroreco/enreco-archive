Though her whereabouts after the first chapter are uncertain—having not appeared in the second journey—many hold onto hope for her return in future stories.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Jyon Watson, Amelia Watson\n**Guild:** Jade Sword\n\nJyon wasted no time causing a stir with her chaotic antics. On her very first day in the kingdom, right after the King had summoned the heroes in hopes of salvation, Jyon hatched a plan to assassinate him. Naturally. Her reasoning? She mistook “Revelation” for “Revolution” and believed the King to be evil, especially since he appeared to bear a \"stain\"—on [his pants](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?t=7108), of all places.\n\nWord of this great conspiracy quickly spread, reaching the ears of Gonathon, the ever-loyal knight who was determined to stop and expose Jyon at all costs. But instead of conflict, fate had other plans: by the second day, the two were happily married, after an exchange of diamonds.\n\nJyon was adored by all. With her cheerful energy and iconic “Bonk” from her Revelation, she brought laughter and light wherever she went. It was no wonder the orange knight fell head over heels for her.\n\nBut just as their love story bloomed, tragedy struck. After conquering the [Ancient Sewers Dungeon](#entry:ancient-sewers-dungeon-entry), Jyon regained her past life’s memories as Amelia Watson—at the cost of forgetting her current self and, more painfully, forgetting Gonathon. The orange knight was heartbroken. Yet Amelia's pain ran deeper, haunted by a sense of having lost something precious—something she couldn’t quite remember.\n\nThrough the guidance of the voices in her head, nudges from those around her, and the lingering feelings buried deep in her heart, she didn’t regain her lost memories—but she found the courage to start anew. Moved by the knight’s steadfast love, Amelia chose to rebuild their bond from scratch. Together, they wove themselves a new [happy ending.](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=12776)\n\nThis marked the close of her chapter—for now. She set off to take care of something important, but the door remains open, if only slightly, for her return to the world and to the knight who still waits.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- One of the Ancient Sewers Dungeon's rewards was the Warp Crystal. This crystal was stated to have been made by Ame.\n\n[Ame](#easter:easter-ame)",

Though her journey with the others was cut short when she was taken back to Atlantis, the memories she made—with her friends and the voices in her head—will remain forevermore.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Gawr Gura\n**Guild:** Scarlet Wand\n\nGura was among the most excited to embark on this strange adventure. She lit up whenever she discovered new things—new mechanics, fascinating dungeon designs—clearly enamored by the thought and creativity behind it all. She regularly expressed admiration for the creators of these intricate feats.\n\nShe was also savage and sassy, delighting in poking fun at others, especially Tam and [Jyon Watson,](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=Zjtfn-It4RAxI-V-&t=7423) _especially_ Jyon. Gura seemed to sense that the two had some sort of preexisting bond—not the romantic kind, but the sort where you’d buy a box of lemons just to leave it in front of the other’s door for no reason. She also loved to mess with Gonathon, fully aware that the knight was head over heels for Jyon.\n\nGura was the founder, or at least, the first member, of the “Appointed Point” cult? Association? Something along those lines. She was the first to don the long, red scarlet hat that became the signature of her [guild](#entry:guilds-entry) and wore it with pride, often boasting about its power and the responsibility that came with it. Thanks to her initiative, the Scarlet Wand members became one of the most united groups.\n\nThough she remained awake and active for a large part of the kingdom's journey, she somehow managed to dodge most of the chaos caused by the other heroes. That didn’t stop her from causing some of her own though, like building a [gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?t=4184) behind a convenience store. For reasons.\n\nShe regained her past memories after conquering the [Ocean Temple Dungeon](#entry:ocean-temple-dungeon-entry), recalling herself as a princess, well, perhaps a commoner, depending on who you asked, from Atlantis. In her past life, she had stolen the all-powerful trident and fled to the surface, bored of the life beneath the sea. But fate caught up with her. Eventually, the dwellers of Atlantis came and took her back—though not before she bid one final farewell to her fellow heroes.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- When the heroes were teleported back to the white box at the end of Chapter 1, Gura sneakily managed to return to Libestal. This was, of course, not supposed to happen, and she was quickly brought back into the box by the gods.\n\n[gura](#easter:easter-gura)",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Memories:** [Recollected](https://youtu.be/j8I3gqJV1NU)\n**Revelation:** [Rest In Peace](#entry:rest-in-peace-entry)\n\nMori Calliope, now with the memories of a disciple of Death itself, didn’t go around slicing people’s lifelines or doing anything grim like that. In fact, she was a woman of many talents—a tavern owner, therapist, auctioneer, builder, you name it. Dedicated to her craft, she was always willing to serve the community, as long as it brought happiness to others.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Mori Calliope\n**Guild:** Jade Sword\n\nCalli was one of the few whose reason for being transported to this enigmatic universe was known—and in typical fashion: she got hit by [a truck.](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?t=331) Timid and somewhat more reserved than others, she tried to avoid chaos whenever she could, mostly keeping to herself. She eventually recalled her past self as Mori Calliope, a reaper, a disciple of Death, after conquering the Underworld Dungeon.\n\nCalli was a woman of justice, standing firmly for what was right, a trustworthy ally for those on the same path, like Elizabeth. Still, she made quite a name for herself by running a tavern called **Death Do Us Part**, which didn’t just serve food—it offered divorce services, too. Seeing how the kingdom was bursting with love, she recognized an opportunity, fully expecting those couples to fall apart in the end. Naturally, the married folks were appalled… until they actually lined up for her [services](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=11280) on the last day.\n\nCalli also played a critical role in the battle against the corruption on the final day. As all hope seemed lost, she was the one who managed to concoct the [cure](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?t=8835) that ultimately saved everyone—really putting her culinary skills to the test. Her tavern bustled with activity, which made the pink tavern owner very happy. Perhaps it was her true calling to bring people together, whether through food, comfort, or even paperwork.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Mordan Ramsey\n**Job:** Chef\n\nThe reaper’s second journey began with a duty already resting on her shoulders. Along with Shakira, she was chosen as one of the “Lore Keepers,” tasked with recording the heroes’ daily adventures for the archive.\n\nUnlike many others, she retained all her memories from the previous journey. So, she thought, why not build another food establishment? Being a chef again felt only natural. Adopting the name _Mordon Ramsey_, she opened a new restaurant that doubled as an inn—offering both meals and lodging—and even included a secret fight club where she and her [“Wolf Pack”](https://www.youtube.com/live/uX0rZYSrb4Q?si=ygzF1V3H5aVxDjwl&t=6658) occasionally held sparring sessions.\n\nThat wasn’t all. Calli also put her other skills to work by opening a therapy stall, offering a listening ear and wise counsel to troubled hearts for a modest fee of 300 coins. This service quickly proved indispensable; as the kingdom’s chaos escalated, more and more people [flocked](https://www.youtube.com/live/ABO6qUKDBG0?si=zw4PRzXBRiyCgpjw&t=14246) to her for help—so many, in fact, that the therapist herself began to wish she could get therapy.\n\nNaturally, Mordon found herself tangled in a few shenanigans, too. She almost ended up in a romance with Gonathon through a blind date setup, if not for Shiori swooping in to reclaim the knight. Even so, Calli poured her heart into interacting with others and making things for them. Her care shone through especially when she spent countless days and nights building houses to [auction off](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=5528) to those still without a roof over their heads.\n\nShe was, after all, a woman of many talents—one deeply invested in the happiness and well-being of her friends.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- In Chapter 1, Calli’s tavern actually cost her more than it earned, since she was constantly handing out free meals and discounts—most of her “customers” were too broke to pay.\n- Every single divorce Calli officiated on the last day of Chapter 1 was to untangle Bijou’s messy web of relationships.\n- In Chapter 2, Calli became notably wary—and downright fearful—of Shiori, who kept meddling with her businesses and saying unsettling things. Just the goth’s presence alone was enough to send chills down her spine.\n\n[calli](#easter:easter-calli)",

Despite her occasional mishaps, she consistently followed her mind and heart, no matter the cost.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Tanakisha Karia of the Oranges, Shakira, The Savior of the Lesbians\n**Guild:** Amber Coin\n\nTanakisha Karia’s destiny was clear from the moment she awoke: to save the ~~lesbians~~ Libestans. Embracing such a heroic calling, the orange lady always tried her best to stand on the side of justice. She reported potential [scams](https://www.youtube.com/live/qKlzaYirN88?feature=shared&t=1129) to Queen Tam Gandr, shielded her friends from deceit, and openly challenged misdeeds. When Nerissa kept pestering Elizabeth to gain her affection, Shakira didn’t hesitate to [call her out.](https://www.youtube.com/live/3cr3DLpyB60?si=lQ_VjUGHZ9A1G2r7&t=13330)\n\nLife could feel lonely in her guild. The Amber Coin had far fewer members than most, especially after one wandered off to the woods and another switched guilds. Still, she pressed on undeterred.\n\nShe rarely entertained nonsense from anyone, always confident and unwavering in her judgment. Yet by journey’s end, this phoenix found herself yearning for someone to love and come home to. She showed interest in a certain [humble knight,](https://www.youtube.com/live/3cr3DLpyB60?feature=shared&t=21557) but his heart was already taken. In the end, she learned to keep moving forward on her own.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Shakira, Kiara Takahashi\n**Job:** Smith\n\nKiara held her head high in Chapter 2. Assigned a new role as a “Lore Keeper” alongside Mordon Ramsey, she eagerly embraced this new life and its responsibilities.\n\nWith her special role, she felt even more compelled to help others however she could. She became something of Elizabeth’s “sugar mommy,” providing materials, lending a hand, guiding the ever-confused knight who struggled to settle in—she even built her a forge. The kind-hearted orange also helped make a fluffy chef’s [dream come true:](https://www.youtube.com/live/wCysZh57Hcc?si=amYBd0PYc_tTX567&t=18155) seeing Fuwawa’s dishes left unsold day after day, she stepped in and bought nearly all of them.\n\nShakira’s curiosity and playful spirit thrived too, as she happily threw herself into others’ antics, acting as the kingdom’s camerawoman and bearing witness to countless [dramas.](https://www.youtube.com/live/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14970)\n\nSometimes, though, her eagerness to help caused trouble of its own. With only the best intentions, she arranged a blind date for Mordon Ramsey and Gonathon—unwittingly setting off a chain reaction that sent Gonathon and Shiori’s relationship into a [tailspin.](https://www.youtube.com/live/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8832) She also ended up playing a part in sparking the kingdom’s infamous “In-bread Incident.”\n\nHer relationships this chapter were far more entangled than in the first, where she largely kept to herself. She even developed a crush on Immerkind… who happened to be her cousin. Perhaps a sign of just how starved for romance she was after her lonely first journey.\n\nNaturally, that didn’t pan out. But when Shakira hit her lowest point, feeling alone in a kingdom overflowing with romance, she found hope in an unexpected place: a certain beeg cat. In a sudden, heartwarming turn, Kiara married Roa, her newfound admiration [blossoming](https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=eGpYwslFn09813CQ&t=13080) into love. Her second chapter closed on a truly wholesome note. She’d finally earned the happy ending to her love story—what more could anyone want?\n\n## Trivia\n\n- The name **Shakira** was actually suggested by Gonathon, since Tanakisha Kiara was a bit too much of a mouthful to read.\n- Shakira often boasted about her ability to speak “the language of the gods,” otherwise known as **German**, proudly one of only two in the entire kingdom who could.\n\n[kiara](#easter:easter-kiara)",

Hard-working, always on the grind, empathetic, and calm, she stood in stark contrast to the chaos around her. She also had a wife who was almost her complete opposite.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** NinoIna\n**Guild:** Cerulean Cup\n\nIna began her journey with a more reserved demeanor than most. Despite being placed in the same [guild](#entry:guilds-entry) as some of the most eccentric individuals in the kingdom, she remained calm and collected throughout. She quickly bonded with others, most notably entangling herself with the [Hot Pink One](#entry:irys-entry), whom she declared her eternal consort as early as Day 2, and with Bijou, whom she lovingly regarded as a sister—bonded over the shared memory of a \"wooden shovel.\"\n\nUpon conquering the [Eldritch Horror Dungeon](#entry:eldritch-horror-dungeon-entry), she recovered memories of herself as Ninomae Ina'nis, a priestess who cared for and tended to lingering souls, sending them off with a smile.\n\nShe was always there when others needed help, standing by during conflicts and supporting her guildmates. Toward the end of the first journey, she became one of the key heroes in halting the corruption, discovering the cure, and saving others, especially her sister, from the [depths of darkness.](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=4490)\n\nIna proved herself to be loyal and dependable, both to her guild and to her beloved. Even when the latter occasionally hurt her feelings, Ina’s empathetic heart led her to forgive. She gave gifts, love, and even gracefully accepted the Hot Pink One’s desire for romantic \"side chicks\" without resentment.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** NinoIna\n**Job:** Jeweler\n\nIna maintained her calm and collected nature into the second journey. While everyone else was out scamming each other or stirring up chaos at the start, she spent her time quietly farming [potatoes](https://www.youtube.com/live/BkJIFGhpKIY?si=TOOasp2g_o_oVHFp&t=6891) by her humble abode.\n\nShe upheld her sisterly bond with Bijou, and this time didn’t need to save her from any corruption. Her path seemed to promise a peaceful, steady journey once again… until the final days.\n\nThe Hot Pink One, still Ina’s consort for the majority of the story, began to test the limits of Ina’s patience with her growing chaos. From the sudden announcement of her pregnancy, to escalating tensions between her and Tam Gandr (her other romantic entanglement), to Tam asking Ina to be her lover instead, and then the Pink One demanding that Ina be hers and hers alone—it all became too much for the potato-loving jeweler.\n\nAnd so, Ina made a [decision](https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=723): she would set off on her own journey—a path of reflection, seeking enlightenment, and asking herself where things had gone wrong… and whether her relationship with the Pink One was still something worth holding onto.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- In both instances where Ina found herself caught in the crossfire of affair and romance drama—first with the Gonathon and Pearl situation in Chapter 1, and then with the Tam Gandr situation in Chapter 2—it was, unsurprisingly, her consort, the Hot Pink One, who was the root cause behind it all.\n\n[ina](#easter:easter-ina)",

Wherever she went, confusion and drama followed—especially of the romantic variety. A magnet for affairs, this pink enigma drew women in just as easily as she pushed them away, thanks to her ever-perplexing personality.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Hot Pink One\n**Guild:** Cerulean Cup\n\nIn the first chapter, the Hot Pink One maintained an aloof, detached demeanor, mostly meandering through her days with an air of nonchalance. Memory loss or not, she remained herself, often ridiculed for the absurdities that escaped her mouth.\n\nShe soon wove herself into the kingdom's shenanigans. Despite her relative inactivity compared to others, she quickly carved out a notorious reputation as a \"side chick magnet.\"\n\nAs early as Day 2, she had already claimed a wife—NinoIna—and, despite professing [eternal loyalty](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?t=9715) to the purple one, continued to gather more women into her orbit—four more, to be exact. She even attempted to ensnare a fifth: a memory-lost [blonde](https://www.youtube.com/live/pH9lSCrTVMY?feature=shared&t=1792) searching for her beloved. A reminder that the pink one was a member of [Cerulean Cup](#entry:guilds-entry), the supposedly empathetic guild.\n\nCall it karma or collapse, but eventually, her polycule of side chicks unraveled, with only her eternal consort remaining at her side.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Hot Pink One, IRyS\n**Job:** Chef\n\nIf Chapter 1 was wild, Chapter 2 showcased the full extent of the Hot Pink One’s chaotic energy. Even though she'd lost her memories again, her personality remained intact—just as eccentric as ever—with her web of relationships becoming even more tangled.\n\nStill known as the Hot Pink One, she took on the role of a chef specializing in chocolate cakes. She also recovered memories of her past self after conquering the [Star Site: Elpis](#entry:star-site-elpis-entry)—recalling herself as IRyS, the embodiment of hope, albeit a drunken one.\n\nAnd as each day passed, the pink one's entanglement with others grew more and more complicated.\n\nNew threads formed: romantic, platonic, and confusing, sometimes all three. She shared mouth-to-mouth meals with a pink cat, declared best friendship with Immerkind (or so the green one claimed), and became part of a peculiar cult known as the \"Inbread.\"\n\nHer familial side blossomed—with Koseki Bijou as her [brother](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=s8GiS__Q7mOaFuB_&t=436), endlessly devoted to her throughout the journey. Ina, her eternal consort, also remained steadfast as her romantic partner. And Tam Gandr, a new and passionate love interest, stood by her side, someone to constantly banter back and forth with.\n\nEverything was going great, until the last few days.\n\nNear the end, to escalate her already chaotic life, the pink one claimed to be pregnant. Bijou even hosted a gender reveal party, unveiling the baby’s gender as [“Gas”](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5739)—since many suspected she was simply gassed up, not pregnant. The events that transpired afterwards shattered her bond with Tam, who then concluded the Hot Pink One wasn’t worth it. That led to an affair between Tam and Ina, which in turn led to Ina embarking on a journey of enlightenment, leaving the pink one devastated and spiraling into a yandere-like state.\n\nFor anyone following the story from her perspective, it was easy to lose track of the actual objective everyone came here for.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- Unsurprisingly, as of Chapter 2, the Hot Pink One holds the record for the most romantic (or ex-romantic) partners: Bijou, Nerissa, Shiori, Amelia (for about a minute), Ina, and Tam.\n\n[irys](#easter:easter-irys)",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Memories:** [Recollected](https://youtu.be/aSFZwinYaaU)\n**Revelation:** [Chrono Surge](#entry:chrono-surge-entry)\n\nTam Gandr, now fully remembered as Ouro Kronii, was infamous in the kingdom for her oppressive charisma, razor-sharp tongue, inflated narcissism, and most of all—her endlessly boasted, self-proclaimed status as Queen.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Tam Gandr\n**Guild:** Cerulean Cup\n\nThe name Tam was given by Gonathon, an acronym for _The Azure Maiden_. \"Gandr,\" the surname, was proudly self-appointed. From the moment she met the [King of Libestal](#entry:outsider-entry), Tam twisted his request for aid into a royal proposal and immediately crowned herself Queen.\n\nOn the first day, she was already amassing devoted followers. [Gonathon](#entry:gigi-entry) stood as her most loyal knight, ready to defend her at every turn, whether she was being accused of illegitimacy or stirring up conflict herself by flaunting her so-called royalty. Usually, it was the [latter.](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=9013)\n\nBut for every follower, Tam earned herself a rival. Elizabeth was the first to call out Tam’s “fake” queen status, while Raora positioned herself as a competing royal. And to be fair, their suspicions were justified. Tam had no claim, no proof, and worst of all—no money. She was _broke_, constantly pretending to be rich, boasting about her 8 billion coin fortune while barely scraping together [8 actual coins.](https://www.youtube.com/live/JcRcTRedS_8?feature=shared&t=4242)\n\nYet beneath the ironclad ego and tyrannical tone, Tam was, at heart, a caring queen. Knowing her journey would only last three days—far shorter than others—she spent her time supporting her guildmates: building a base, sharing what little she had, and standing up for them when needed. And yes, there was even space in her allegedly cold heart for a potential romance. She fell for the Hot Pink One, but that crush ended in [disappointment,](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared&t=8234) as the pink maiden was already promised to another.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Tam Gandr\n**Job:** Supplier\n\nTam began her second journey with no memory of the first one. Gone was the commanding queen; in her place stood someone quieter, more withdrawn, content with grinding in solitude and basking in the peace.\n\nThat peace didn’t last.\n\nAfter reclaiming her memories at [Star Site: Chronos](#entry:star-site-chronos-entry)—where the Warden, Ouro Kronii, reawakened within her—Tam was pulled back into chaos. Her fumbling knight Gonathon brought [drama](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=vXgt9AUn-I4rIQ5o&t=11385) to her door via a complicated telenovela-like story with Shiori. Cecilia publicly framed her as a tyrannical queen. Things got so bad that even her therapist asked if she’d considered murder as a reasonable solution.\n\nYet the most tumultuous arc was her relationship with the [Hot Pink One](#entry:irys-entry). Fate had seemingly given them a second chance. Early on, the two bonded, exchanged cheesy nicknames like “Tammy” and “Pinky,” and formed a surprisingly sweet connection.\n\nAs time passed, however, the pink lady began to dominate the dynamic, treating the once-queen as her maid, her toy, and her personal _hobby_. The breaking point came during a gender reveal party for Pinky’s nonexistent child. With a straight face, she asked Tam to be godfather to her and Ina’s kid.\n\nThat was it. Tam [snapped.](https://www.youtube.com/live/CUh9eciJil4?t=7701)\n\nShe cut ties, took revenge, and made a bold play for Ina herself. In a dramatic reversal, the oppressed queen reclaimed her crown—not through royalty, but by clapping back hard and laughing as she came out on top.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- Tam was the poorest of all the heroes in Chapter 1; she was also the only person who never managed to surpass the 1,000-coin mark.\n\n[kronii](#easter:easter-kronii)",

A hardworker with a little chaotic gossip touch, when Bae sets a goal in mind, whether it be love or gold, she _will_ put her all in it. Though her romance isn't as chaotic as _others_ _cough cough IRyS_, Bae spreads Chaos of the non-romantic variety when the opportunity presents itself.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Peasant The Bae\n**Guild:** Amber Coin\n\nJust like her newly found companions, Peasant The Bae found herself whisked away to the land of Libestal with nary a memory. Scared and confused, it took Bae much of Day 1 to get used to her duties as a hero, but, ultimately, this was a profession she would reject. Bae was not a hero, they chose the wrong rat for she is but a humble, simple peasant! Deep into the woods the Peasant ran, missing much of the fights, adventures, and complicated relationships (See any relationship chart from Chapter 1) during this time. And sparring herself the grief of understanding the romance in the kingdom.\n\nHowever, one can only escape their fate for so long; Bae would be found, and dragged, back to the Libestal to her [grievance](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=1529). Sometimes when the world asks for you, even when you don't answer the call, the call would call truck-kun to have you dragged back... _What? The King was the enemy?_ Bae knew that the Monarchy was the true enemy all along! [Down with the King](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=4833).\n\nOn the bright side, Bae got a [nice peasant hat (with a gold coin)](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=1844) for her troubles.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Peasant The Bae\n**Job:** Supplier\n\nChapter 2's Peasant the Bae certainly had more colour to her story. From rags to riches, Bae toiled and worked for her gold, culminating in her own successful business, [\"tHE dUMPSTER\"](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=14135). Bae seizes any opportunity to sell her wares or offer her services to any customer her way. Soon, \"Peasant\" became much more than a status of her previously lack of wealth, [\"Peasant\"](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=1511) is an honourable title Bae wore.\n\nFrom little gossips that casually slanders the royal body that governs the kingdom, putting the 'libel' in *Libel*stal, to heartfelt connections, Bae truly connected with others more in this Chapter. Though her [growing love with Immerkind](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4571) that unfortunately ended in heartbreak, it nonetheless gave way to a [Brotherhood stronger than obsidian](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5292). Bae would find a steadfast friend in Gonathan G as he remained by her side during the most trying time of her life.\n\nIt wasn't just friendships Bae found; Bae found kids. Abandoned, she took them under her wing and cared for them, even to the point of a custody dispute with Bijou and Shiori. Luckily, and at the expense of Mordan Ramsay, [State Farm was formed](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13328) between this small disfucntional family plus Gonathan.\n\nBut who was \"Peasant The Bae\" truly? In the midst of the games of the Chaos Dungeon, fragments of memories would soon return... Bae worried at first, would she still be \"Bae\" if she remembers? As the Stain King fades in defeat Bae remembers... She wasn't a peasant, Bae was CHAOS HERSELF. Even with her identity recovered, Bae swore to remain [Peasant The Bae](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=5680) in honour of the brat who took her beloved Box. That Charlie...\n\nThough some memories were recovered, it was only some. A few questions lingered in Bae's mind, especially about a certain mysterious Mother whose advice Bae still remembers post-amnesia.\n\n#### Mother\n\nThroughout Chapter 2, Bae has constantly made references to a mysterious figure in her memories whom she simply called \"Mother\". \"Mother\" has offered many words of wisdom to Bae before she mysteriously disappeared from Bae's life. Unfortunately, even with the return of some of Bae's memories, the origin of \"Mother\", who she truly was, remains a mystery. Perhaps \"Mother\" was \"Brother\" in the form of Charlie? Whoever she, or he, is, it remains to be seen if Chapter 3 will unveil this mysterious character.\n\nNotable wise words from Mother found in Chapter 2:\n\n[\"Mother always said, if you have nothing... you have nothing.\"](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2111)\n\n[\"Day 2 Diary 2 entry: Mother always warned me...\"](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=11052)\n\n[\"Mother always warned me, with love comes heartbreak\"](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=733)\n\n[\"Not a quote but Mother skipped a certain lesson for Bae\"](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=7171)\n\n## Trivia\n\n- Despite only being around for two days and showing little interest in the kingdom, Bae somehow ended up with more coins than Tam in Chapter 1, narrowly avoiding the title of the kingdom’s poorest.\n- When Bae wore the Stain Hat in Chapter 2, it caused quite a stir. Many feared she was falling to corruption like so many did in Chapter 1—especially since she kept complaining about headaches while wearing it. Thankfully, she turned out fine.\n- Bae takes great pride in her title as “Peasant” and was quick to put anyone in their place if they dared think it was something shameful.\n\n[bae](#easter:easter-bae)",

Regardless, her mark on the tale remains indelible.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Ceres Fauna\n**Guild:** Scarlet Wand\n\nFauna embodied the ideals of her [guild](#entry:guilds-entry), intelligence and curiosity, though exactly how she applied those traits to the betterment of the kingdom remains a hot topic. As early as Day 2, she boldly declared her intent to abandon all kingdom-related duties and instead live life as an \"NPC,\" launching her personal venture: [_FaunaMart_](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared&t=176).\n\n[FaunaMart](#entry:storylines-entry) rapidly became a household name, if not quite for the reasons Fauna might have hoped, thanks to its flagship product: _lottery tickets_. Rumors and accusations of scamming ran rampant, but Fauna, ever the determined entrepreneur, remained unfazed.\n\nShe worked tirelessly to build her business, gaining many customers through persistence and savvy marketing. Among them was a particularly enthusiastic Mococo—perhaps _too_ enthusiastic—who eventually turned around and sued the store for murky, legally grey reasons.\n\nFauna’s empire even faced direct competition when a rival shop, _NanaEleven_, appeared and swiftly stole her entire customer base. Most would have crumbled. Fauna, instead, confronted her rival—only for the two to unexpectedly reconcile and join forces, shaking hands to form a [business alliance.](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=1516)\n\nTo Fauna, FaunaMart _was_ her world. Even as the world teetered on the edge of collapse, she kept her store running with an [“End of the World Sale.”](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?t=142) Whether her business-minded obsession made her a proper hero was debatable, but her heart was undeniable. She was admired by those around her, especially by Nerissa, who appreciated her sincerity, creativity, and kindness... even with the alleged scamming.\n\nHaving now vanished with the profits in hand and fleeing interrogation from the authorities, the kingdom can do little but salute the green-thumbed CEO for all she’s done. Wherever she is now, one thing is certain: FaunaMart lives on—in memory and in legend.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- Despite rejecting allegations of scamming her customers, Fauna didn't realize during the first few days of running the lottery that the magical system she used to generate random numbers was flawed. In other words, she had, albeit accidentally, scammed her customers by producing rigged results.\n- Although Fauna ran the largest business in the kingdom, she was far from being the richest.

Mischievous, adorable, and unwaveringly committed to whatever she set her sights on—no matter how silly, or how much pain it caused others. A truly special gem.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Koseki Bijou\n**Guild:** Cerulean Cup\n\nBijou was unpredictable, _very_ unpredictable. Which was saying something, considering the existing chaos caused by the other heroes. But Bijou’s unpredictability was on a completely different level.\n\nJust a few days in, she’d already managed to get herself a wife—[Shiori](#entry:shiori-entry)—whom she loved dearly... only to dump her on the final day, leaving her with a child.\n\nShe also acquired a mother. Two, actually. And got involved in a polygamous relationship with three other women, all while wearing a wide colon-D smile on her face. A smile she often used to get what she wanted—after all, who could say no to that cute, [pleading expression?](https://www.youtube.com/live/oVguNTPnDww?feature=shared&t=1902)\n\nShe claimed to be of royalty, a princess, because of the crown she wore. Whether she was truly royal was up for debate, considering she acted like a literal toddler: always up to mischief, constantly messing about.\n\nBut when it came to commitment, Bijou didn’t mess around. Early on, she set her sights on a goal—not saving the world or anything trivial like that—but acquiring [a hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?t=22515). She dedicated entire days and nights, hoarding money, gambling her life away just to afford more gacha boxes. All because she saw someone else’s hat and got jealous.\n\nThat hat, as it turned out, would shift the entire narrative, not just for her, but for the whole kingdom. It was a _Stain hat_, and over time, it slowly corrupted its wearer’s mind until they were consumed completely. Bijou was its first victim. She dubbed herself the _Stain Princess_, spreading chaos across the kingdom, corrupting the land with fire, writing cursed tomes titled _Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame x Nerissa Ravencroft_, and dragging others into corruption alongside her.\n\nUltimately, with the combined efforts of the remaining heroes—most notably her sister, NinoIna—the corruption was purged, and Bijou was saved. She realized how painful it was to be shackled by something beyond her control. In response, she [severed](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=13345) her ties to the polygamy situation, and to Shiori as well.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Koseki Bijou\n**Job:** Jeweler\n\nIn this second chapter, the mischievous gem maiden had lost all memories of her previous journey. So naturally, she did what made perfect sense: declared a random stranger—[the Hot Pink One](#entry:irys-entry)—as her [brother](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=eLLiweZ183nhGJCJ&t=2233).\n\nShe was obsessed with this “onii-chan,” wagging after her whenever she was near, snuggling up to her like an actual little brother asking about her school day (don’t question the gender dynamic here). She cared so much about her that she was even willing to leap off a cliff beside her during her darkest moment. She even organized an entire gender reveal party in her honor. Once again, Bijou's dedication and commitment were front and center.\n\nIn contrast, her so-called brother had done virtually nothing good for her. If anything, she caused her more familial trauma than comfort, to the point where the poor gem had to rely on _maps_ as her coping [mechanism](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=fuv5o4ggw4tby11g&t=13403).\n\nBijou also served as a diligent employee at the Gacharm business, a loyal wingwoman and sidekick for her boss, Roa, and a loving sister to Ina—once again, the two reunited from their past journey. Tam also became her mother, simply because Bijou wanted her to be. Déjà vu?\n\nShe even attempted to atone for her past mistake of abandoning Shiori and their child. This time, she managed to mend their fractured bond.\n\nIn short, Bijou was kind and diligent toward everyone around her. It felt as though she was doing her best to redeem herself, for falling to corruption, for hurting those she cared about. She had turned over a new leaf, no longer driven by blind greed.\n\n…Which made the final twist all the more shocking.\n\nAt the end of the journey, Bijou—along with Fuwawa, Mococo, Nerissa, and Shiori—turned against Fia and the remaining heroes.\n\n_“The darkness in the heart always takes over, nothing stays pure,”_ the gem maiden [said](https://www.youtube.com/live/C6kmnHsopgM?t=8151).\n\n## Notable Writings\n\n- [Read \"Fire and Flight (Volume 1)\"](#text:fire-and-flight-1)\n- [Read \"Fire and Flight (Volume 2)\"](#text:fire-and-flight-2)\n- [Read \"Fire and Flight (Volume 3)\"](#text:fire-and-flight-3)\n\n## Trivia\n\n- By playing the music disc \"Violet\"—as a prank to mess with Ina, Bijou accidentally made one of the most iconic moments that defined Chapter 1, between Gonathon G and Amelia Watson.\n- Many others had a habit of calling the gem princess \"Biboo,\" which usually prompted Bijou to correct them.\n\n[bijou](#easter:easter-bijou)",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Memories:** Not Recollected\n**Revelation:** [Resonant Strike](#entry:resonant-strike-entry)\n\nNerissa Ravencroft—more precisely, Nerissa _Juliet_ Ravencroft—was a kind and hard-working maiden, always eager to lend a hand to those in need. She had a playful tendency to flirt, meaning every word even if it was all wrapped in teasing banter. Yet her heart undeniably saved a special place for one particular knight in red, a bond that became the talk of the entire journey.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Nerissa Ravencroft\n**Guild:** Scarlet Wand\n\nLike many others, Nerissa’s story began in confusion: dazzled, unsure of her purpose. But she quickly found her footing and threw herself into her new life with remarkable zeal. Among them all, she might have been the most diligent: grinding quests, gathering materials, and, of course, making mountains of potato salad. It all led to her becoming the richest, most resourceful soul in the kingdom.\n\nAnd she didn’t do it to flaunt her wealth, though she’d admit her deep pockets felt good, but because she genuinely wanted to support those she loved. Her dedication was most clearly seen as FaunaMart’s number one (and only) employee. Nerissa respected the green CEO so much that she spent countless days gathering resources to build the shop, stock it, and watch over it when Fauna wasn’t around… even if that earned her a mental scar or two whenever a certain [feral pink doggo](https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?t=1251) tried to chase her down for scamming.\n\nMore of her heart showed in how she helped Gonathon mend ties with his beloved, acting as his number one [wing-woman.](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=2806)\n\nCuriosity was also a defining trait, she proudly embodied the clever, inquisitive spirit of the Scarlet Wand. She explored nearly every corner of the kingdom, speaking to countless citizens, uncovering secrets that others missed. She even [theorized](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=12299) early on that the king was evil, a claim later proven true. Truly, the Scarlet Wand’s reputation for wit was in good hands.\n\nYet for all her maturity and responsibility, Nerissa’s composure often crumbled in matters of the heart. No, not in the many-questionable polygamous ties she shared with four other women, but rather in her growing closeness with one particular scarlet knight: [Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame.](#entry:liz-entry)\n\nThey began as strangers, then came curiosity. From that, playful exchanges, then teasing, misunderstandings, chaos—at one point even her “death” and ghostly revival—all colored by Nerissa’s admiration and respect. She delighted in flustering Elizabeth, the poor knight often branding Nerissa a witch, half in jest, half in exasperation.\n\nBut beneath it all, their playful jabs turned genuine. Without either fully admitting it, something deep and unspoken blossomed between the blue and the red. An invisible thread tied them together.\n\nAt the climax of their journey, when the kingdom fell to corruption, Nerissa herself succumbed. And who [saved](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?si=W9a6h2OXmkOQk3JU&t=7287) her? None other than the shining knight in red. From that moment on, Nerissa knew: this one—this one was a keeper.\n\n---\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Nerissa Juliet Ravencroft\n**Job:** Chef\n\nIn Chapter 2, the blue maiden began once more with a blank slate. Her past was gone, her very name forgotten. So she set out searching for answers, asking her fellow heroes if they knew who she was. Most were just as lost as she was. All except, of course, Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame.\n\nEven with her memories in fragments, Nerissa’s diligence never wavered. She balanced her work as a devoted chef, crafting yet another mountain of potato salad, with her supposed role as a hero, all while getting caught up in the kingdom’s many antics. She even joined the so-called “Wolf Pack.”\n\nHer boundless curiosity stayed with her. Once again, she explored nearly every corner of the kingdom, read through the library’s countless tales, and uncovered stories others overlooked.\n\nBit by bit, her [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/5sWjzbacGUY?si=KUn5fSB0crLgmamn&t=12079) returned. They were hazy, but they were hers—precious glimpses of who she was and what had shaped her. She longed to cherish them all: the Scarlet Wand, the corruption, the moments of joy, and the depths of pain.\n\nAbove all, she yearned for her name. Early in her journey, she asked, “Who am I?”\nIt was Elizabeth who answered her, without teasing or nicknames.\n\n> “Nerissa Ravencroft. Or you also called yourself ‘Juliet,’ I guess.”\n\nIt sounded [right.](https://www.youtube.com/live/XfZh_3xb7i0?si=xVwBE_o5TFb2HfsC&t=5287) Being close to Elizabeth felt right. As more memories of the red knight returned—the witch accusations, the teasing, the moment Elizabeth saved her—Nerissa promised herself she would never forget again.\n\nFrom then on, she sought out Elizabeth’s company even more. They sparred, exchanged gifts, placed their portraits side by side, and shared the same roof. Elizabeth didn’t push her away; she smiled, [bonded](https://www.youtube.com/live/vMdhvi8dHN4?si=JeT3qPPFMnB0yoCr&t=6692) with Nerissa, and seemed to genuinely enjoy it. Even calling her a “witch” was now done with playful affection.\n\nIt was bliss, and Nerissa wanted more.\n\nThen something inside her cracked.\n\nA misunderstanding on the fifth day led Nerissa to believe Elizabeth hated her. It crushed her, stirring something deep inside, a painful clarity of just how important the red knight truly was to her. Even after the confusion was cleared up, Nerissa’s fixation only deepened. Every thought [revolved](https://www.youtube.com/live/MXqotm_8_Hc?si=owgU25DUzPfslUZl&t=1192) around Elizabeth. Her tone changed, her eyes never strayed from the knight. She wanted Elizabeth completely. It was as if a sea of blue was closing in around a fragile red flame. A chilling aura settled around Nerissa. She would not, could not, ever forget Elizabeth again.\n\nBy the journey’s end, Nerissa, along with Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, and Shiori, chose to reject Fia’s plea and carve their own path, setting themselves against the other heroes. How Elizabeth might react, and whether their fragile, growing bond could survive this choice, only time would tell.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- In Chapter 1, Nerissa was the only person to amass over 50,000 coins on her own, making her the richest individual in the entire kingdom.\n- In Chapter 2, Nerissa nearly gave up her work as a chef because no one was buying her food.\n- (Out of character) During a Chapter 2 post-analysis stream, Nerissa expressed that she would like to be called Nerissa Juliet Ravencroft within the ENreco universe, to distinguish herself from _the_ Nerissa Ravencroft.\n\n[neri](#easter:easter-nerissa)",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Memories:** Not Recollected\n**Revelation:** [Bookmark of Memories](#entry:bookmark-of-memories-entry)\n\nShiori was possibly one of the most intriguing heroes. Weird, quirky, unpredictable—her surface was all eccentricities, but underneath lay secrets, depth, and a quiet, unnerving awareness. Hints were dropped all along that she retained not just her own memories, but fragments of everyone else's as well. There was an aura to her—of someone who knew things others didn’t, things she _shouldn’t_.\n\nThis omniscient undertone came to full light in Chapter 2, culminating in a shocking heel turn at the end of the journey alongside four others.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Shiori Nyavella\n**Guild:** Scarlet Wand\n\nIn the first chapter, Shiori appeared to be little more than the oddball who kept to herself. She hovered on the fringes, avoided drama, asked bizarre questions, and said strange things that raised eyebrows and caused, at times, [psychic damage.](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=8760)\n\nShe floated like a leaf in the wind, constantly swept into relationships she never agreed to. Betrothed to Bijou? Sure, until Bijou dumped her on the final day and left her with a baby to raise alone. Dragged into a polygamous relationship with four other women? Yes—only to see it crash and burn at the end.\n\nShiori just wanted a simple life. But fate had other plans.\n\nAmidst the chaos, however, she found herself intrigued by Gonathon G—a sincere, loyal knight devoted to his Pearl. Something about his earnestness stirred something in her. She tried to win him over, but when she saw his heart already belonged to someone else, she let it go, quietly and respectfully.\n\nAll of that might sound like harmless, comedic fluff, but those distractions obscured a deeper thread. Throughout the journey, Shiori dropped [cryptic remarks](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?si=Tv8iBK5Q96G63XiA&t=6689) suggesting she had never truly lost her memories at all—that she was merely playing along.\n\nIt all came to a head in one final statement:\n_“But the question is: Did I really have amnesia?”_\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Shiori Nyavella\n**Job:** Chef\n\nChapter 2 began much like the first: Shiori was still odd, still drifting, still spouting peculiar lines. But this time, she chose to be more present, more deliberate in her interactions. She made stronger bonds, opened up, got involved. For some, it was refreshing. For others, like poor Mordan Ramsey, it was a nightmare, as Shiori [terrorized](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=Y_mj_z_Qpgx2OJKj&t=11795) the tavern owner endlessly in every way possible.\n\nBut this new openness led to one of the chapter’s most significant romances: her relationship with [Gonathon](#entry:gigi-entry). Fate had seemingly offered Shiori another shot at the orange knight—now with no memories of his past beloved, who was no longer around.\n\nWhat started as manipulation, tricking him out of coins, slowly bloomed into affection. Gonathon’s kindness chipped away at Shiori’s walls. She cooked for him, made a shared room, and [genuinely cared.](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=GgmAIeHBDZrl4Pmq&t=7857) It was sweet, quiet, and in stark contrast to her whirlwind past.\n\nBut just as she was ready to take the next step, Gonathon faltered. He hesitated, depended too much on others, and never made his own choices. His devotion felt more like obligation than love. Shiori gave him chances—many of them—but, when it became clear he wouldn't change, she made the painful decision to step away. They returned to being friends… or so it seemed.\n\nIn truth, Shiori took things further: she _wiped_ him from her memory entirely.\n\nBecause yes—Shiori could manipulate memories. Whether she could do it to others was unclear, but she could certainly do it to herself.\n\nBeyond being a butter-churning, beet-eating chef, Shiori held another secret identity: _an Archiver_. She took on writing commissions, often silly \"fanfics,\" but hidden among them were the “Memory” commissions. These were not fiction. These were truths—recollections of real [memories,](https://www.youtube.com/live/tJ_YXGE3o2w?si=7ajFqe3fWIHtWYs2&t=11107) forgotten or buried.\n\nSome found these tales amusing, while others found them disturbing. Some doubted their veracity. But Shiori insisted: _she never lied. Everything she wrote was the truth._\n\nShe knew.\nEverything.\nEven things no one else remembered.\nEven things she was never _supposed_ to know.\n\nAbout the _scripts_ that guided their lives.\nAbout the events playing out in the kingdom, behind the curtains and beyond the veil.\nAbout the _story_.\n\nAnd perhaps it was this knowledge that drove her final decision.\n\nWhen Fia called on the heroes to fight the Outsider, five of them refused: Nerissa, Bijou, Fuwawa, Mococo, and Shiori. Standing at the front of this rebellion, it was Shiori who spoke first—declaring their rejection of Fia's plea and sparking a new chapter of resistance.\n\n## Notable Writings\n\n- [Read \"Sea x Lovers\"](#text:sea-x-lovers)\n- [Read \"Sea x Lovers\"](#text:chicken)\n- [Read \"Sea x Lovers\"](#text:cucumber)\n- [Read \"Sea x Lovers\"](#text:gyatt)\n- [Read \"Sea x Lovers\"](#text:pickles)\n- [Read \"Sea x Lovers\"](#text:the-princess-1)\n- [Read \"Sea x Lovers\"](#text:the-princess-2)\n- [Read \"Sea x Lovers\"](#text:the-cell)\n- [Read \"Sea x Lovers\"](#text:tam-x-tam)\n- [Read \"Sea x Lovers\"](#text:kiara-roa-snu)\n\n## Trivia\n\n- Shiori has a habit of referring to others not by their actual names, but by quirky, often oddly specific titles. For example, she calls Nerissa \"the birded one\" or _\"the tall lady,\"_ Gonathon \"the fumbly one,\" and Mococo \"the belly button girl,\" among others.\n\n[shiori](#easter:easter-shiori)",

Rarely dragged into the dramatic antics of others, she remained a hardworking and honest doggo who dutifully completed her tasks and quietly warmed the hearts of those around her.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Fuwawa Abyssguard\n**Guild:** Jade Sword\n\nThough she began more lost than most, Fuwawa showed a strong will to grow, learning as she went. With the help of Elizabeth, her trusty bread lady, she found her footing and steadily carved her own path. She never gambled, never stirred up conflict—just focused on her quests. This made her a sharp contrast to her fuzzier counterpart, [Mococo](#entry:mococo-entry), who frequently got into trouble. Fuwawa spent much of her time keeping an eye on her until she finally got so fed up that she [gave up](https://www.youtube.com/live/cYvEiwlPkW0?feature=shared&t=2121) trying altogether.\n\nToward the end, Fuwawa found unexpected joy in chickens. It began when she tended Elizabeth’s small flock of chicks, and soon, she developed a deep connection with them. But when corruption took hold of the kingdom, tragedy struck. Time and again, her beloved chicks were slaughtered, despite her best efforts to protect them. Eventually, Fuwawa herself fell to the corruption.\n\nYet with the help of her comrades, the corruption was vanquished, and Fuwawa returned to normal. Peace was restored, and once more she gathered a new flock of chicks, her happiness complete… until Mococo accidentally murdered them all. [Again.](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?t=7268)\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Fuwawa Abyssguard\n**Job:** Chef\n\nCarrying the same warm-hearted spirit into the second chapter, Fuwawa took on the role of a [chef](#entry:jobs-entry)—not for power or glory, but simply because she wanted to make others smile through her cooking. With that goal, she wasted no time building a cozy little café, hoping it could become a space where people could come together in a kingdom rife with drama.\n\nShe worked hard, gathering ingredients and crafting dishes with care. Things, however, didn’t go as planned. For days, not a single dish was sold. Her café was quiet, ignored. She began to feel invisible, thinking the other chefs were just too good. With no involvement in anyone else's wild adventures, Fuwawa began to wonder if her dream had been too naive. [Loneliness](https://www.youtube.com/live/geV0HyX5LUA?si=LCtvw4QaRwM0kijj&t=11917) crept in.\n\nBut then at the end of Day 4, a kind [orange lady](#entry:kiara-entry) gave her the boost she needed. Word spread of the wholesome chef and her heartfelt dishes. People flocked to her café. Her food sold out. The fluffy one was [overjoyed,](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=0iZ1c9GCaj656Svv&t=546) and not only that, she was commissioned to prepare a grand buffet for the kingdom’s gender reveal party.\n\nIt felt like the perfect ending.\n\nBut then came the twist.\n\nOn the final day, Fuwawa, along with Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori, turned away from the other heroes. They rejected Fia’s wish and chose to follow their own path.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- Fuwawa's chicken flocks in Chapter 1 were murdered, rebuilt, and murdered again—a total of six times.\n- By Chapter 2, Fuwawa had amassed over 60,000 coins, becoming the richest person in the kingdom and surpassing Nerissa's Chapter 1 record of around 50,000 coins.\n\n[fuwawa](#easter:easter-fuwawa)",

Notorious for her lottery addiction in Chapter 1, she was helpless before the thrill of gambling. One of the most chaotic and shameless of the bunch, she would do just about anything to line her pockets.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Mococo Abyssguard\n**Guild:** Jade Sword\n\nMococo’s journey began from a vulnerable place. Before Elizabeth promised to be her protector and big sister, she was terrified of this strange new world, easily frightened and desperate not to be left [alone.](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=4128) But with her friends’ support, she slowly found her footing, working hard and living up to her role as a hero—though that didn’t last long.\n\nBy the second day, she had discovered [FaunaMart’s lottery tickets](#entry:storylines-entry). It started with just a couple, but soon grew to hundreds as the doggo blew through her funds despite everyone’s concerns. What began as harmless fun spiraled into an addiction. Mococo became a problem herself, extorting friends for more money and [straining relationships.](https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?t=1251)\n\nYet there were glimpses of something more to her. Her obsession with money led her to understand she actually needed to _work_ for it—do business, hustle. Her sister and friends were still the most important things in her life. Underneath it all, Mococo was terrified of being alone. Eventually, she managed to quit gambling (at least until NanaEleven tempted her back).\n\nBy the journey’s end, she fell to the corruption—first swayed by Bijou’s influence and by far the most afflicted of all. She hurt others, ravaged the lands, slaughtered animals and crops, which led everyone to pull away from her—the very thing she dreaded most. Even Elizabeth, whom she adored most, looked on with [wary eyes.](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?si=N5N4vgyOALaXs9db&t=1610)\n\nBut with everyone’s help, Mococo was saved.

Determined to do better, she vowed to work hard, stay off the gambling—well, mostly—and repay those who once helped her.\n\nAnd she did. As a dedicated jeweler and loyal employee of Gacharms, she kept herself busy and, with no lottery around, was spared from falling feral again. Sure, the gambling didn’t vanish completely, but it was far less destructive this time.\n\nHer chaotic nature persisted, though. Eavesdropping became a new hobby—on one occasion she overheard Mordon’s therapy session and decided to open her own [therapy business.](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=-ZizHO6g5xCSHEr9&t=9493) Never mind the lack of credentials: her sessions consisted of “uh huh, yeah, just follow your heart,” delivered like a true pro. But hey, for dirt-cheap prices, you got what you paid for.\n\nToward the journey’s end, Mococo started feeling... off. A creeping sickness, a gnawing sense of something wrong. On the final day, it proved true. As if seized by a mysterious force, she, along with four others, defied Fia and the rest of the heroes, choosing to carve their own path instead.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- Mococo seems to have it out for chickens: she slaughtered Fuwawa’s entire flock in Chapter 1, and later killed the Hot Pink’s “child”—which happened to take the form of a chicken—on sight in Chapter 2.\n- Her relentless pursuit of wealth made her the third richest hero by the end of Chapter 1 (just behind Fauna and Nerissa), and one of the top earners again in Chapter 2, with coin totals hitting the five-digit mark both times.\n- She bought a whopping **452 lottery tickets** in Chapter 1 (447 from FaunaMart, 5 from NanaEleven). From it, she only won 710 coins at FaunaMart, 500 coins at NanaEleven (whose tickets were free), but walked away with a 10,000-coin settlement from Nerissa during the lottery fiasco. In the end, she netted a profit of 6,740 coins.\n- When Cecilia requested a 5% cut from the 10,000-coin settlement for her legal services, Mococo handed her 180 coins—a mere 1.8%. Cecilia didn’t question it.\n\n[mococo](#easter:easter-mococo)",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Memories:** Not Recollected\n**Revelation:** [Thorn of Order](#entry:thorn-of-order-entry)\n\nElizabeth had always been a knight through and through. From the very first day of her journey, she stood unwavering—just, strong-willed, and devoted to what was right. She fought against wrongs and injustice with unwavering conviction. Yet beneath that armored resolve lay a caring, loving heart that always looked out for others. This was especially true when it came to a certain blue maiden, whose very presence sent the red knight’s heart fluttering time and time again.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame\n**Guild:** Jade Sword\n\nElizabeth began her journey with a conviction that would define her character throughout, even with no memory of who she once was. She embraced the mantle of a knight—dutiful, responsible, compassionate, and loyal to her [King.](#entry:outsider-entry)\n\nBut as noble as she was, Elizabeth was also terribly clumsy and somewhat clueless when it came to the inner workings of the kingdom. The systems were far too advanced for a classical knight like her, and more often than not, she ended up needing help instead of giving it.\n\nStill, her spirit mattered most. Her genuine care and kindness made her a dependable companion to many. She was the ever-trusty guardian of the two doggos, a reliable comrade to her guildmate Calli, and the first to stand up to Tam for her arrogance. She even [adopted](https://www.youtube.com/live/oVguNTPnDww?feature=shared&t=1902) Bijou temporarily, just because the gem maiden asked her to.\n\nShe did it all because she believed it was her duty as a knight. It was what she should do—what her King would want.\n\nBut not everything she did stemmed from duty.\n\n[Nerissa Ravencroft.](#entry:nerissa-entry) Just the sound of that [name](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?t=1716) was enough to make Elizabeth’s heart race and her face flush with the color of strawberries. Witchcraft—that’s what Elizabeth called it. She deemed Nerissa a witch for making her feel this way, and because of that, decided it was her _duty_ to “monitor” her. But was that truly her King’s will, or was it her own?\n\nElizabeth played a major role in liberating the kingdom from corruption on the final day. But just when it seemed the fight was over, the truth shattered her world. The King she had loyally served was revealed to be evil—a deceiver who had manipulated them all. Elizabeth was devastated; her beliefs and ideals were turned upside down.\n\nAt first, she hesitated, insisting that the King was still her ruler. But upon witnessing her comrades get hurt, she made a choice: to no longer fight for a king, but for her friends—and for [herself.](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?t=17881)\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame\n**Job:** Smith\n\nElizabeth’s new journey saw her unchanged in spirit—still kind, still helpful, still firmly righteous. And yes, still struggling with the kingdom’s systems. Like last time, with support from friends like Shakira, she began to manage.\n\nOne noticeable thing about her this time—she was more relaxed compared to before. She'd sneak around, peeking in on others' shenanigans by making herself invisible (well, sort of), eavesdropping on their conversations. She’d tag along and [banter](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=50KJ0NQbXZVnvoL6&t=8749) with those she felt close to, like Cecilia and Roa, and even joined in on bizarre, chaotic events—like the kingdom’s gender reveal party.\n\nShe started journaling all of it in a series she called _Knight Logs_, chronicling her experiences, recalling her last journey, and, of course, detailing her continued “monitoring” of her “Juliet,” Nerissa Ravencroft.\n\nThis journey marked clear progress in that “monitoring” relationship. The endless bickering and witch accusations from the first chapter gave way to bonding moments—sparring, gambling, hanging portraits beside one another, and writing heartfelt letters. It was a [deepening connection.](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=0WJ6A3s8dUHs0eLF&t=8123) Though the witch accusations? Those stayed.\n\nThen came the twist. At the end of the journey, Nerissa, along with four others, turned against the heroes to follow her own path. Elizabeth’s reaction was left unspoken, left for the next chapter. Was it anger? Shock? A sense of betrayal? Whatever it was, Elizabeth would want a happy ending. For herself. For everyone.\n\nThrough this journey, the scarlet knight came to understand more of what it _truly_ meant to be a knight.\n\nA knight needs no glory, no praise—only purpose. The more she fulfilled that purpose, the more she began to wonder about her life before all this. A life where—\n\n> \"My heart was whole. Where I was not afraid of my own name. Where I did not flinch at the sound of my own sword.\"\n\nShe couldn’t remember that life—not fully. But she could feel traces of it, perhaps in lingering memories or in words from those who knew the truth, even if she wasn’t ready to [accept it.](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=6E-r2kSyXFeSXW_-&t=24060) But no matter what her past held, one thing remained certain—one truth that would never change:\n\n> \"And yet still, I rise.\n> I lend my sword to those who need it—even if it means I break a little more with every swing.\n> Kindness need not feel soft to be real.\n> Sometimes, it is simply what remains when everything else has burned away.\"\n\n## Notable Writings\n\n- [Read \"Knight's Log 0001](#text:liz-journal-c2d1)\n- [Read \"Knight's Log 0002](#text:liz-journal-c2d2)\n- [Read \"Knight's Log 0003](#text:liz-journal-c2d3)\n- [Read \"Knight's Log 0004](#text:liz-journal-c2d4)\n- [Read \"Knight's Log 0005](#text:liz-journal-c2d5)\n- [Read \"Knight's Log 0006](#text:liz-journal-c2d6)\n\n## Trivia\n\n- As of Chapter 2, Elizabeth is the only one who has not missed a single day in this enigmatic journey.\n\n[liz](#easter:easter-liz)",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Memories:** Not Recollected\n**Revelation:** [Automaton Assault](#entry:automaton-assault-entry)\n\nCecilia was an enigma: a theorist, a contrarian, a knight who only served royalty, and a chaos enabler wherever she went. Always stirring up wild theories and pouring oil onto already chaotic fires, she had a knack for yapping endlessly on the spot. Anyone foolish enough to argue with her had virtually no chance of winning.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Cecilia Immergreen\n**Guild:** Scarlet Wand\n\nCecilia’s journey in the first chapter was a little different from most. She wasn’t one for manual labor to earn money or goods—instead, she preferred shortcuts, [leeching](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=3020) off others with shameless ease. Need money? She’d \"borrow\" it and promise to pay it back (spoiler: she never did). A hat for sale? She’d offer a live performance and a couple of junk items in exchange. Weapons? Tools? She was “far too busy” to get them herself. Easy, quick, and sweat-free.\n\nShe was, after all, a member of the [Scarlet Wand](#entry:guilds-entry), a guild grounded in intelligence and curiosity, and she embodied both traits. As early as the second day, Cecilia was already spouting [conspiracy theories](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=3869) about the kingdom, the king, and the grand scheme behind it all. Many thought she was crazy—until her theories turned out to be true.\n\nThat sharp green mind of hers landed her many questionable \"opportunities.\" Penniless from her aversion to work, she advertised herself into a slew of roles: German teacher for her guildmates, marketer for FaunaMart’s lottery, and even a lawyer for a feral dog threatening to sue the aforementioned lottery. A conwoman with no licenses in any field, yet always ready to lend a hand. Better Call Doll!\n\nIn the latter half of the journey, Cecilia claimed yet another title: Koseki Bijou’s knight. The moment she learned the gem girl was of (self-proclaimed) royal status, she swooped in. Not out of loyalty, but with a scheming mind, planning to use the princess as a puppet and eventually rule the kingdom from the shadows. Her plan nearly [worked:](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=5496) she even performed a supposed ancient ritual to gain control of the princess. But before she could take it further, time ran out.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Cecilia Immerkind\n**Job:** Supplier\n\nWith her memories lost once more, Cecilia awoke feeling... slightly different. Perhaps deep down, she sensed how manipulative she’d been in the past. A flicker of change prompted her to take on the name “Cecilia Immerkind.” Whether she truly became kinder is up for debate, as her personality remained mostly intact.\n\nNow more of an enabler than an instigator, she roamed freely, making chaotic situations even worse—calling Tam a tyrant, poking her nose in Gonathon and Shiori’s relationship drama, and becoming one of the sparks that ignited the infamous [incest scandal](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?t=18700s) on the third day.\n\nShe also built stronger, more layered relationships this time. She remained loyal to the Wolf Pack, claimed to be best friends (allegedly) with the Hot Pink One (whom she dubbed \"Oliver\"), and continued to serve as Bijou’s knight.\n\nBut nothing stood out more than her unwavering love and devotion for the kingdom’s princess, [Iphania](#entry:iphania-entry). From the moment she laid eyes on her, Cecilia was awestruck. She swore allegiance, made countless efforts to earn her favor, and held firm to her [feelings](https://www.youtube.com/live/I75IWfMGVgM?t=7144) throughout the journey.\n\nAnyone who stood between her and the princess, like the Outlander, was an immediate rival. She even considered abandoning the Wolf Pack just to stay by the princess’s side. When Peasant the Bae, someone who once bickered with Cecilia but eventually warmed up to her, confessed her feelings, Cecilia rejected her on the spot. Because in Cecilia’s heart, there was only the princess.\n\nIn the end, her love was never reciprocated. Heartbroken but resolute, she upheld her vow to protect the princess. Even when tragedy struck on the final day and the princess was slain by the Curse, Cecilia pressed on. And when she learned that Fia, the Librarian who had guided them all along, was Iphania herself, still alive and well in the [Library,](#entry:library-entry) it gave her all the reason she needed to keep fighting.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- Despite her vast web of connections in Chapter 1, Cecilia had never once interacted with Peasant the Bae—who, in fact, was the only person she hadn’t interacted with at all. Which made it all the more surprising when, in the second chapter, the latter developed a crush on her.\n- In both Chapter 1 and 2, Cecilia was the only one who did not build herself a house nor a store.\n\n[cecilia](#easter:easter-cecilia)",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Memories:** Not Recollected\n**Revelation:** [Gremlin Grenade](#entry:gremlin-grenade-entry)\n\nThe humble knight known as Gonathon G. has faced many trials and tribulations during his adventures in Libestal, but has never once abandoned his dedication to helping those in need. Gonathon was committed to fighting for his beloved Queen and the people of the kingdom, as well as the many friends he made during his adventures. While hardly a stranger to heartache and loss, Gonathon's unbreakable resolve to do what was right and his steadfast humility would see him through many challenges, even those from the most unlikely of places.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Gonathon G.\n**Guild:** Cerulean Cup\n\nWhile legends would tell that Gonathon G. was a humble knight of stalwart heart and noble deed, the truth of the matter is that his tale was marked by missteps and indecision.\n\nFor much of the first chapter of his adventure, Gonathon was labeled as an easy mark by those who sought to exploit him. His hard work and dedication saw him amass a hearty fortune in gold, and many others, including those he saw as friends, would [manipulate and exploit him for money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB2jUKUsxtE&t=6008s). Yet, despite these often obvious ploys, Gonathon remained committed to helping others and wished to bring out the best in them.\n\nAlong with his desire to assist others, Gonathon’s strongest quality was his deep devotion to those he deemed important. First, there was [Tam Gandr](#entry:kronii-entry), the upstart and self-proclaimed queen of Libestal. Despite leaving only a few days after the journey began, Gonathon remained loyal to her to the very end, even going so far as to build a massive statue in her honor. Even as others demeaned her, attempted to usurp her position, and even defaced the statue Gonathon built, the humble knight [remained dedicated to the one he saw as a queen worth serving](https://youtu.be/oygFzGlMT28?t=2979).\n\nIn addition to Tam, Gonathon’s relationship with [Jyonathan Watson](#entry:ame-entry) would define his days in Libestal. Starting as a target of Gonathon’s suspicions, Gonathon and Jyonathan would soon fall in love and become married—a stalwart diamond and a gentle pearl. Alas, [tragedy](https://youtu.be/oygFzGlMT28?t=9378) would strike the Pearl in the form of amnesia brought about by the recovery of her past memories. Worse still, a crestfallen Gonathon appeared to simply accept the loss of his Pearl. It was here that Gonathon’s kindness to others would bear fruit, as his friends intervened and exhorted him not to give up on his Pearl. With friends at his back and love in his heart, Gonathon was able to [break through to Jyonathan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvRIdaH107U&t=12776s), and the two shared a tearful reunion as the first chapter of their adventure came to a close.\n\nDespite many fumbles along the way, Gonathon would prove not only that he was a loyal and devoted friend, but also that deep down, he was capable of fighting for his own beliefs, and not simply blindly following the desires of others.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Gonathon G.\n**Job:** Smith\n\nThe second chapter of Gonathon’s adventure would see even more triumph and heartache. Going into this new adventure, the humble knight was seemingly once again afflicted with amnesia, and the loss of the memory of his Pearl would serve as the core of his struggles.\n\nDespite his mental malaise, Gonathon would go on to help many people and inspire his friends to stay true to themselves. Although he viewed himself as a simple servant of the queen, he would form and lead the [Wolf Pack](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=2105), composed of his closest friends and allies. Along the way, he would motivate Cecilia Immerkind to embrace her love for Princess Iphania, drive Tam Gandr to accept her role as queen, [strike down the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9279), and bring a heartbroken Peasant The Bae back from the brink of despair. The position of blacksmith was a natural choice for Gonathon, as it allowed him to provide upgrades to his companions' gear, allowing him to protect them in spirit.\n\nAt the same time as his humility and everlasting loyalty shone through, so too did his naivety and inability to make his own choices. Nowhere was this more apparent than in his relationship with [Shiori of the Nyavellas](#entry:shiori-entry). Unable to recall his Pearl, Gonathon sought to mend the hole in his heart by supporting and courting Shiori. Regardless of his pure and noble intentions, Gonathon’s [failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSPi8sTHdAY&t=12003s) to decouple his dedication to his queen from his desire for love led him to [fumble](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=16262) several times in his interactions with Shiori. While the two eventually reconciled, this heartbreak would leave a lasting impact on Gonathon, and finally push him to [take more agency](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=10507) in his life.\n\nWhile the future remains murky, particularly given the climactic conclusion of Chapter 2, Gonathon has come out of his adventures in ancient Libestal determined to fight for what he believes in and right his past wrongs.\n\n## Notable Writings\n\n- [Read \"A Knight's Tale\"](#text:a-knights-tale)\n- [Read \"A Knight's Wish\"](#text:a-knights-wish)\n\n## Trivia\n\n- In Chapter 1, Gonathon was able to have some level of interaction with every other member, an impressive feat considering this included Bae the Peasant, who was absent for all but the first and final day.\n- In both Chapters 1 and 2, Gonathon's attempts to build massive structures ran into snags due to being unable to build above a certain elevation. This was the case for his Tam Gandr statue in Chapter 1 and the World Tree house in Chapter 2. Interestingly, both cases were also references to members of Promise, Ouro Kronii and Ceres Fauna, respectively.\n- Gonathon's gender being male was due to Gigi Murin's misunderstanding that she was playing an amnesiac version of herself rather than a unique character. Even after learning this, she decided to stick with having Gonathon be referred to as he/him.\n- If one had a nickel for every time Gonathon’s love interest forgot about him, they’d have two nickels—which isn’t a lot, but it’s oddly enough that it happened twice.\n\n[gigi](#easter:easter-gigi)",

She was a hard-working big cat who dabbled in many different endeavors and, for some reason, constantly sought out romantic partners.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Raora Panthera, Mario\n**Guild:** Amber Coin\n\nRaora’s journey began with a memorable interaction with [Tam Gandr](#entry:kronii-entry), the self-proclaimed queen of the kingdom—whose name Raora could never quite pronounce. That exchange marked the beginning of what would become a defining trait of Raora’s character: she believed _she_ was the rightful ruler of the kingdom, not Tam, thus sparking a playful [rivalry.](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared&t=13146)\n\nThe difference between the two queens? Raora actually put in the work. She genuinely cared for her guildmates and even built a castle with designated rooms for each of them.\n\nShe was also a loving mother to two, Bijou and Ina. Her affection showed in the way she tried to rescue Bijou from corruption and how deeply moved she was when the two sisters clashed in battle.\n\nFor the most part, Raora did her own thing, occasionally dropping in on others’ chaos. And that rivalry with Tam? It came full circle—by the end of the journey, the two were married. From enemies to lovers.\n\nDid she become queen in the end? That remains unclear. But in her heart, and in the hearts of those close to her, she already was.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Roa Pandora\n**Job:** Jeweler\n\nThe pink cat’s second journey began with a new name, Roa Pandora, and no memories of her previous adventure. But that didn’t stop her from immediately chasing a bold goal: to open the kingdom’s largest jewelry shop, where everyone would come to buy the finest charms. The shop would be called _Gacharm_, and its slogan? “Tiny treasure, infinite pleasures!”\n\nWith the help of her diligent [employees](https://www.youtube.com/live/i54lsw-XjDA?t=692) and her own tireless dedication, Roa managed to bring her vision to life early in the journey.\n\nThis time around, her web of relationships became even more tangled. Unlike in the first chapter, Roa actively involved herself in others’ affairs—sometimes _literal_ affairs. She became the third rose to bloom between Tam and the Hot Pink One, ultimately contributing to the collapse of their relationship. Then, her attention shifted to a certain red knight, [Elizabeth.](https://www.youtube.com/live/m2OG5auudrQ?si=8Q0YfMORv-AQL_qj&t=11014)\n\nDespite her efforts, Elizabeth’s heart already belonged to another.

      "content": "## Overview\n\nIphania—now known as Fia—was once the Princess of Ancient Libestal, and now serves as the keeper of [the Library](#entry:library-entry), the timeless sanctuary that lies beyond space and time. It was she who rescued the heroes from the destruction of the [fabricated world](#entry:libestal-ficta-entry), pulling them into the past not only to save their lives, but to ask a favor: to help her prevent [the Outsider](#entry:outsider-entry) from ever coming into existence.\n\n## Details\n\n### Backstory\n\nLong ago in [Ancient Libestal](#entry:libestal-ancient-entry), the kingdom was ruled by Princess Iphania, the last of her royal bloodline. Both her parents, along with many close to her, had perished from the spreading corruption. The world was falling apart, and the Book of Prophecy foretold nothing but doom.\n\nDespite the grim prophecies, Iphania refused to yield to despair. She continued to fight with unwavering resolve—even if it meant defying fate itself. Her unshakable will moved the heart of **the Watcher**, a divine observer tasked only with watching worlds play out.\n\nBreaking his oath, the Watcher disguised himself as a swordsman, **the Outlander**, and fought to save the world at her side. Together, they succeeded: the Curse was slain, and the source of corruption destroyed.\n\nBut fate was cruel. A fragment of the Curse survived, hiding itself inside Iphania’s cherished doll. At the moment no one expected, it reemerged and struck her down. Though her body perished, Iphania’s soul lingered, clinging to the very doll that had caused her demise, and which now bore her spirit within.\n\nAs the world crumbled into ruin, her soul drifted through space and time, eventually finding refuge in the Library. The sanctuary preserved her essence, though in exchange, she could never leave. Taking on the name **Fia**, a nickname once given to her by the Outlander, she became the Library's eternal caretaker.\n\nBound within those walls, Fia could do little but reflect—on her kingdom’s fall, the Outlander’s punishment, and the cycle of despair that led to **the Outsider’s** creation. She longed to save them both but was powerless. That is, until she saw them—the heroes, her Shining Stars.\n\nWith new hope, she summoned them into the past, to a time one week before the pivotal moment of her world’s doom, praying they could succeed where she could not.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\nUpon first meeting the heroes, Fia explained the truth: the King they once knew was a fraud, the Outsider, who sought to destroy the universe. She asked for their aid, though she herself could not recall all the details, having lost fragments of her memory due to the strain of time travel.\n\nShe asked the heroes to help her recover what had been lost.\nAnd so, they did.\n\nTheir journey took them through Ancient Libestal, where they met Iphania’s past self—a princess still fighting to defy destiny. Through dungeons, Star Sites, and battles, the heroes slowly pieced together Fia’s lost memories. With clarity regained, she proposed a new path: let the heroes take up the Outlander’s burden of saving the world so that he would not be punished, and the Outsider would never be born.\n\nThe heroes shared the truth with Iphania, who, alongside them, convinced the Outlander to relinquish his fate. He agreed. And the plan worked—they defeated [the Curse](#entry:heart-of-ruin-entry) and saved Libestal.\n\nBut just as victory was within reach, fate struck again.\nThe Curse reemerged during the celebration banquet, slaying Iphania in one final, merciless act.\n\nThen, a higher and far more cryptic being appeared—shattering space itself. It condemned the Outlander for abandoning his divine role, and the heroes for interfering with fate. Their punishment was imminent.\n\nBut Fia intervened, pulling the heroes back into the Library once more and leaping through time to escape the entity’s grasp. With this final time jump, all of her memories returned—her life as the Princess of Libestal, her tragic death, and how she came about as the current Librarian.\n\nHistory had repeated itself. Once again, she failed to break fate.\n\nYet even now, she refused to give in. This time, rather than change the past, she asked the heroes to help her change the future. To do what they still could—here and now—and carve a new path forward.\n\nMost of the heroes agreed without hesitation.\nBut not all.\n**Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori** chose to stay behind, unable—or unwilling—to follow Fia any further.",

      "content": "## Overview\n\nThe Outsider was the one who first summoned all the heroes to the fabricated [Kingdom of Libestal](#entry:libestal-ficta-entry), posing as the benevolent king and deceiving them into freeing him from his ancient bindings. A being consumed by hatred and resentment toward the forces that once imprisoned him, he sought nothing less than the destruction of the universe as revenge. The heroes were the only ones standing in his way.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\nNineteen heroes were summoned to the Kingdom of Libestal by its seemingly kind and gentle ruler. The king pleaded for their strength to save his realm from the growing threat of the Stains. His demeanor was compassionate, his motives appeared noble—and it was all a lie.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Stain King, the monarch revealed his true identity. The so-called calamity had been orchestrated by him, and by defeating it, the heroes had unknowingly broken the seals on his prison. No longer bound, he shed his disguise and revealed his true form—**The Captive** (later known as **the Outsider**).\n\nHis intent was clear: to destroy all of existence as retribution for his imprisonment. But through the combined efforts of the heroes, he was ultimately struck down. However, as he fell, the very world began to collapse into the void. In the final moments, a mysterious entity intervened, pulling the heroes from the brink of annihilation.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\nThe heroes were pulled back in time by **Fia** to the ancient era of Libestal, an age before the Outsider’s existence—in hopes of preventing his tragic birth altogether.\n\nDuring their journey, they encountered a wandering, nameless swordsman, **the Outlander**, who was on his own mission to destroy the Heart of Ruin, the wellspring of corruption plaguing the land.\n\n#### The Nameless Swordsman\n\n**The Outlander**\nDriven by purpose and haunted by knowledge, the Outlander fought to rid the world of its impending doom. However, during an expedition into the [Stronghold of Ruin](#entry:stronghold-of-ruin-entry), he was overtaken by the corruption and sealed within. The heroes, dispatched by Princess Iphania, were able to conquer the dungeon and free him.\n\nDespite his rescue, the Outlander remained distant, skeptical of their resolve. He believed the burden of salvation fell solely upon him. Unbeknownst to him, that belief would lead to his downfall.\n\n**The Watcher**\nEventually, his true identity was revealed: he was **The Watcher**, a member of the Collective, tasked only with observing worlds unfold—never intervening. Yet he had broken this sacred code. Inspired by Iphania’s bravery despite her doomed fate, he chose to abandon his post and rewrite the outcome, assuming the role of a nameless swordsman in order to defy destiny itself.\n\n**The Outsider**\nFor this defiance, he was punished by the _Higher Being_—imprisoned for eternity within a fabricated reflection of the very kingdom he tried to save. As centuries passed, resentment turned to madness, and from that despair, the Outsider was born.\n\n#### The Price for Defying Fate\n\nAfter learning his fate and seeing the strength of the heroes firsthand, the Outlander relinquished his role. Trusting them with the task of saving the world, he stepped back. And they succeeded, slaying [the Curse](#entry:heart-of-ruin-entry), destroying the Heart of Ruin, and restoring peace.\n\nBut fate, it seemed, was not so easily undone. In a cruel twist, the Curse reemerged in its final moments and struck down Princess Iphania. The Outlander, devastated by grief, faced judgment once again. The mysterious Higher Being, who had been watching from beyond, declared that his betrayal of the Collective was irreversible. Imprisonment awaited him still. The cycle could not be broken—the Outsider would still be born.\n\nNow, with the universe at stake and the truth of the past fully unveiled, the heroes must face their greatest challenge yet: stopping the Outsider once and for all.",
