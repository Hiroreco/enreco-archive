      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Memories:** Not Recollected\n\nFuwawa Abyssguard was one of the few \"normal\" heroes amidst the chaos. Rarely dragged into the dramatic antics of others, she remained a hardworking and honest doggo, dutifully completing her tasks and quietly warming the hearts of those around her.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Fuwawa Abyssguard\n**Guild:** Jade Sword\n\nThough she began more lost than most, Fuwawa showed a strong will to grow, learning as she went. With the help of Elizabeth, her trusty bread lady, she found her footing and steadily carved her own path. She never gambled, never stirred up conflict—just focused on her quests. This made her a sharp contrast to her fuzzier counterpart, Mococo, who frequently got into trouble. Fuwawa spent much of her time keeping an eye on her until she got so fed up that she gave up trying altogether.\n\nToward the end, Fuwawa found unexpected joy in chickens. It began when she tended Elizabeth’s small flock of chicks, and soon, she developed a deep connection with them. But when corruption took hold of the kingdom, tragedy struck. Again and again, her beloved chicks were slaughtered despite her best efforts to protect them. Eventually, Fuwawa herself fell to the corruption.\n\nYet, with the help of her comrades, the corruption was vanquished, and Fuwawa returned to normal. Peace was restored, and once more she gathered a new flock of chicks—her happiness complete… until Mococo accidentally murdered them all. Again.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Fuwawa Abyssguard\n**Job:** Chef\n\nCarrying the same warm-hearted spirit into the second chapter, Fuwawa took on the role of a chef—not for power or glory, but simply because she wanted to make others smile through her cooking. With that goal, she wasted no time in building a cozy little café, hoping it could become a space where people came together in a kingdom rife with drama.\n\nShe worked hard, gathering ingredients and crafting dishes with care—but things didn’t go as planned. For days, not a single dish was sold. Her café was quiet, ignored. She began to feel invisible. The other chefs were just too good, she thought. And with no involvement in anyone else's wild adventures, Fuwawa began to wonder if her dream had been too naive. Loneliness crept in.\n\nBut then, at the end of Day 5, a kind orange lady gave her the boost she needed. Word spread of the wholesome chef and her heartfelt dishes. People flocked to her café. Her food sold out. The fluffy one was overjoyed—so much so that she was commissioned to prepare a grand buffet for the kingdom’s gender reveal party.\n\nIt felt like the perfect ending.\n\nBut then came the twist.\n\nOn the final day, Fuwawa, along with Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori, turned away from the other heroes. They rejected Fia’s wish and chose to follow their own path.",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Memories:** Recollected\n\nThe Hot Pink One, now remembered as IRyS, was a whirlwind of relationship chaos wrapped in a deceptively carefree shell. Wherever she went, confusion and drama followed—specifically of the romantic variety. A magnet for affairs, this pink enigma drew women in just as easily as she pushed them away, thanks to her ever-perplexing personality.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Hot Pink One\n**Guild:** Cerulean Cup\n\nIn the first chapter, the Hot Pink One maintained an aloof, detached demeanor. While others got swept up in the kingdom’s wild affairs, she mostly meandered through her days with an air of nonchalance. Memory loss or not, she remained unapologetically herself—often ridiculed for the absurdities that escaped her mouth.\n\nStill, despite her relative inactivity compared to others, she quickly carved out a notorious reputation as a \"side chick magnet.\"\n\nAs early as Day 2, she had already claimed a wife—Nino Ina—and, despite professing eternal loyalty to the purple one, continued to gather more women into her orbit. Four more, to be exact. She even attempted to ensnare a fifth: a memory-lost blonde searching for her beloved. A reminder that the pink one was a member of Cerulean Cup, the supposedly empathetic guild.\n\nCall it karma or collapse, but eventually, her polycule of side chicks unraveled, with only her eternal consort remaining at her side.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Hot Pink One\n**Job:** Chef\n\nIf Chapter 1 was wild, Chapter 2 showcased the full extent of the Hot Pink One’s chaotic energy. Even if she'd lost her memories again, her personality remained intact, as eccentric as ever, with her web of relationships becoming even more tangled.\n\nStill known as the Hot Pink One, she took on the role of a chef specializing in chocolate cakes and gradually recovered her memories—recalling herself as IRyS, the embodiment of hope, albeit a drunken one.\n\n[Recollection - IRyS](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uaWaQg4pnM)\n\nAnd as each day passed, the pink one's entanglement with others grew more and more complicated.\n\nNew threads formed: romantic, platonic, confusing—sometimes all three. She shared mouth-to-mouth meals with a pink cat, declared best friendship with Immerkind (or so the green one claimed), and became part of a peculiar cult known as the \"Inbread.\"\n\nHer familial side blossomed—with Koseki Bijou as her brother, endlessly devoted to her throughout the journey. Ina, her eternal consort, also remained steadfast as her romantic partner. And Tam Gandr, a new and passionate love interest, stood by her side, someone to constantly banter back and forth with.\n\nEverything was going great, until the last few days.\n\nNear the end, to escalate her already chaotic life, the pink one claimed to be pregnant. Bijou even hosted a gender reveal party, unveiling the baby’s gender as “Gas”—a result of many suspecting she was simply gassed up, not pregnant. The events that transpired afterwards shattered her bond with Tam, who then concluded the Hot Pink One wasn’t worth it. That led to an affair between Tam and Ina, which then led to Ina embarking on a journey of enlightenment, leaving the pink one devastated, spiraling into a yandere-like state.\n\nIf anyone followed the story from her perspective, it was easy to lose track of the actual objective everyone came here for.",
