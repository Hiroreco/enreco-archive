Though her whereabouts after the first chapter are uncertain—having not appeared in the second journey—many hold onto hope for her return in future stories.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Jyon Watson, Amelia Watson\n**Guild:** Jade Sword\n\nJyon wasted no time causing a stir with her chaotic antics. On her very first day in the kingdom—right after the King had summoned the heroes in hopes of salvation—Jyon hatched a plan to assassinate him. Naturally. Her reasoning? She mistook “Revelation” for “Revolution” and believed the King to be evil, especially since he appeared to bear a \"stain\"—on his pants, of all places.\n\nWord of this great conspiracy quickly spread, reaching the ears of Gonathon, the ever-loyal knight who was determined to stop and expose Jyon at all costs. But instead of conflict, fate had other plans: by the second day, the two were happily married, after an exchange of diamonds.\n\nJyon was adored by all. With her cheerful energy and iconic “Bonk” from her Revelation weapon, she brought laughter and light wherever she went. It was no wonder the orange knight fell head over heels for her.\n\nBut just as their love story bloomed, tragedy struck. After conquering the Ancient Sewer Dungeon, Jyon regained her past life’s memories as Amelia Watson—at the cost of forgetting her current self and, more painfully, forgetting Gonathon. The orange knight was heartbroken. Yet Amelia's pain ran deeper, haunted by a sense of having lost something precious—something she couldn’t quite remember.\n\nThrough the guidance of the voices in her head, nudges from those around her, and the lingering feelings buried deep in her heart, she didn’t regain her lost memories—but she found the courage to start anew. Moved by the knight’s steadfast love, Amelia chose to rebuild their bond from scratch. Together, they wove themselves a new happy ending.\n\nThis marked the close of her chapter—for now. She set off to take care of something important, but the door remains open, if only slightly, for her return to the world and to the knight who still waits.",

      "content": "## Overview\n\nCecilia was an enigma: a theorist, a contrarian, a knight who only served royalty, and a chaos enabler wherever she went. Always stirring up wild theories and pouring oil into already chaotic fires, she had a knack for yapping endlessly on the spot. Anyone foolish enough to argue with her had virtually no chance of winning.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Cecilia Immergreen\n**Guild:** Scarlet Wand\n\nCecilia’s journey in the first chapter was a little different from most. She wasn’t one for manual labor to earn money or goods—instead, she preferred shortcuts, leeching off others with shameless ease. Need money? She’d \"borrow\" it and promise to pay it back (spoiler: she never did). A hat for sale? She’d offer a live performance and a couple of junk items in exchange. Weapons and tools? She was “far too busy” to get them herself. Easy, quick, and sweat-free.\n\nShe was after all, a member of the Scarlet Wand, a guild grounded in intelligence and curiosity, and she embodied both traits. As early as the second day, Cecilia was already spouting conspiracy theories about the kingdom, the king, and the grand scheme behind it all. Many thought she was crazy—until her theories turned out to be true.\n\nThat sharp green mind of hers landed her many questionable \"opportunities.\" Penniless from her aversion to work, she advertised herself into a slew of roles: German teacher for her guildmates, marketer for FaunaMart’s lottery, and even a lawyer for a feral dog threatening to sue the aforementioned lottery. A conwoman with no licenses in any field, yet always ready to lend a hand. Better Call Cecilia!\n\nIn the latter half of the journey, Cecilia claimed yet another title: Koseki Bijou’s knight. The moment she learned the gem girl was of (self-proclaimed) royal status, she swooped in. Not out of loyalty, but with a scheming mind—planning to use the princess as a puppet and eventually rule the kingdom from the shadows. Her plan nearly worked: she even performed a supposed ancient ritual to gain control of the princess. But before she could take it further, time ran out.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Cecilia Immerkind\n**Job:** Supplier\n\nWith her memories lost once more, Cecilia awoke feeling... slightly different. Perhaps deep down, she sensed how manipulative she’d been in the past. A flicker of change prompted her to take on the name “Cecilia Immerkind.” Whether she truly became kinder is up for debate, as her personality remained mostly intact.\n\nNow more of an enabler than instigator, she roamed freely, making chaotic situations even worse—calling Tam a tyrant, poking her nose in Gonathon and Shiori’s relationship drama, and becoming one of the sparks that ignited the infamous incest scandal on the third day.\n\nShe also built stronger, more layered relationships this time. She remained loyal to the Wolf Pack, claimed to be best friends (allegedly) with the Hot Pink One (whom she dubbed \"Oliver\"), and continued to serve as Bijou’s knight.\n\nBut nothing stood out more than her unwavering love and devotion for the kingdom’s princess, Iphania. From the moment she laid eyes on her, Cecilia was awestruck. She swore allegiance, made countless efforts to earn her favor, and held firm to her feelings throughout the journey.\n\nAnyone who stood between her and the princess—like the Outlander—was an immediate rival. She even considered abandoning the Wolf Pack just to stay by the princess’s side. When Peasant the Bae, someone who once bickered with Cecilia but eventually warmed up to her, confessed her feelings, Cecilia rejected her on the spot. Because in Cecilia’s heart, there was only the princess.\n\nIn the end, her love was never reciprocated. Heartbroken but resolute, she upheld her vow to protect the princess. Even when tragedy struck on the final day and the princess was slain by the Curse, Cecilia pressed on. And when she learned that Fia, the Librarian who had guided them all along, was Iphania herself—still alive and well in the Library—it gave her all the reason she needed to keep fighting.",

Regardless, her mark on the tale is indelible.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Ceres Fauna\n**Guild:** Scarlet Wand\n\nFauna embodied the ideals of her guild—intelligence and curiosity—though exactly how she applied those traits to the betterment of the kingdom remains a hot topic. As early as Day 2, she boldly declared her intent to abandon all kingdom-related duties and instead live life as an \"NPC,\" launching her personal venture: _FaunaMart_.\n\nFaunaMart rapidly became a household name—if not quite for the reasons Fauna might have hoped, thanks to its flagship product: lottery tickets. Rumors and accusations of scamming ran rampant, but Fauna, ever the determined entrepreneur, remained unfazed.\n\nShe worked tirelessly to build her business, gaining many customers through persistence and savvy marketing. Among them was a particularly enthusiastic Mococo—perhaps _too_ enthusiastic—who eventually turned around and sued the store for murky, legally grey reasons.\n\nFauna’s empire even faced direct competition when a rival shop, _NanaEleven_, appeared and swiftly stole her entire customer base. Most would crumble. Fauna, instead, confronted her rival—only for the two to unexpectedly reconcile and join forces, shaking hands to form a business alliance.\n\nTo Fauna, FaunaMart _was_ her world. Even as the world teetered on the edge of collapse, she kept her store running with an “End of the World Sale.” Whether her business-minded obsession made her a proper hero was debatable—but her heart was undeniable. She was admired by those around her, especially by Nerissa, who appreciated her sincerity, creativity, and kindness—even with the alleged scamming.\n\nHaving now vanished with the profits in hand, fleeing interrogation from the authorities, the kingdom can do little but salute the green-thumbed CEO for all she’s done. Wherever she is now, one thing is certain: FaunaMart lives on—in memory and in legend.",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Memories:** Not Recollected\n\nFuwawa Abyssguard was one of the few \"normal\" heroes amidst the chaos. Rarely dragged into the dramatic antics of others, she remained a hardworking and honest doggo, dutifully completing her tasks and quietly warming the hearts of those around her.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Fuwawa Abyssguard\n**Guild:** Jade Sword\n\nThough she began more lost than most, Fuwawa showed a strong will to grow, learning as she went. With the help of Elizabeth, her trusty bread lady, she found her footing and steadily carved her own path. She never gambled, never stirred up conflict—just focused on her quests. This made her a sharp contrast to her fuzzier counterpart, Mococo, who frequently got into trouble. Fuwawa spent much of her time keeping an eye on her until she got so fed up that she gave up trying altogether.\n\nToward the end, Fuwawa found unexpected joy in chickens. It began when she tended Elizabeth’s small flock of chicks, and soon, she developed a deep connection with them. But when corruption took hold of the kingdom, tragedy struck. Again and again, her beloved chicks were slaughtered despite her best efforts to protect them. Eventually, Fuwawa herself fell to the corruption.\n\nYet, with the help of her comrades, the corruption was vanquished, and Fuwawa returned to normal. Peace was restored, and once more she gathered a new flock of chicks—her happiness complete… until Mococo accidentally murdered them all. Again.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Fuwawa Abyssguard\n**Job:** Chef\n\nCarrying the same warm-hearted spirit into the second chapter, Fuwawa took on the role of a chef—not for power or glory, but simply because she wanted to make others smile through her cooking. With that goal, she wasted no time in building a cozy little café, hoping it could become a space where people came together in a kingdom rife with drama.\n\nShe worked hard, gathering ingredients and crafting dishes with care—but things didn’t go as planned. For days, not a single dish was sold. Her café was quiet, ignored. She began to feel invisible. The other chefs were just too good, she thought. And with no involvement in anyone else's wild adventures, Fuwawa began to wonder if her dream had been too naive. Loneliness crept in.\n\nBut then, at the end of Day 5, a kind orange lady gave her the boost she needed. Word spread of the wholesome chef and her heartfelt dishes. People flocked to her café. Her food sold out. The fluffy one was overjoyed—so much so that she was commissioned to prepare a grand buffet for the kingdom’s gender reveal party.\n\nIt felt like the perfect ending.\n\nBut then came the twist.\n\nOn the final day, Fuwawa, along with Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori, turned away from the other heroes. They rejected Fia’s wish and chose to follow their own path.",

Though her journey with the others was cut short when she was taken back to Atlantis, the memories she made—with her friends and the voices in her head—will remain forevermore.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Gawr Gura\n**Guild:** Scarlet Wand\n\nGura was among the most excited to embark on this strange adventure. She lit up whenever she discovered new things—new mechanics, fascinating dungeon designs—clearly enamored by the thought and creativity behind it all. She regularly expressed admiration for the creators of these intricate feats.\n\nShe was also savage and sassy, delighting in poking fun at others, especially Tam and Jyan Watson—_especially_ Jyan. Gura seemed to sense that the two had some sort of preexisting bond—not the romantic kind, but the sort where you’d buy a box of lemons just to leave it in front of the other’s door for no reason. She also loved to mess with Gonathon, fully aware that the knight was head over heels for Jyan.\n\nGura was the founder—or at least, the first priestess—of the “Point Point” cult? Association? Something along those lines. She was the first to don the long, red scarlet hat that became the signature of her guild and wore it with pride, often boasting about its power and the responsibility that came with it. Thanks to her initiative, the Scarlet Wand members became one of the most united groups.\n\nThough she remained awake and active for a large part of the kingdom's journey, she somehow managed to dodge most of the chaos caused by the other heroes. That didn’t stop her from causing some of her own though—like building a gallows behind a convenience store. For reasons.\n\nShe regained her past memories after conquering the Underwater Dungeon, recalling herself as a princess—well, perhaps a commoner, depending on who you asked—from Atlantis. In her past life, she had stolen the all-powerful trident and fled to the surface, bored of the life beneath the sea. But fate caught up with her. Eventually, the dwellers of Atlantis came and took her back—though not before she bid one final farewell to her fellow heroes.",

Hard-working, always on the grind, empathetic and calm, she stood in stark contrast to the chaos around her. And she had a wife who was almost her complete opposite.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Nino Ina\n**Guild:** Cerulean Cup\n\nIna began her journey with a more reserved demeanor than most. Despite being placed in the same guild as some of the most eccentric individuals in the kingdom, she remained calm and collected throughout. She quickly bonded with others, most notably entangling herself with the Hot Pink One, whom she declared her eternal consort as early as Day 2, and with Bijou, whom she lovingly regarded as a sister—bonded over the shared memory of a \"wooden shovel.\"\n\nShe was always there when others needed help, standing by during conflicts and supporting her guildmates. Toward the end of the first journey, she became one of the key heroes in halting the corruption, discovering the cure and saving others—especially her sister—from the depths of darkness.\n\nIna proved herself to be loyal and dependable, both to her guild and to her beloved. Even when the latter occasionally hurt her feelings, Ina’s empathetic heart led her to forgive. She gave gifts, love, and even gracefully accepted the Hot Pink One’s desire for romantic \"side chicks\" without resentment.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Nino Ina\n**Job:** Jeweler\n\nIna maintained her calm and collected nature into the second journey. While everyone else was out scamming each other or stirring up chaos at the start, she spent her time quietly farming potatoes by her humble abode.\n\nShe upheld her sisterly bond with Bijou—and this time, didn’t need to save her from any corruption. Her path seemed to promise a peaceful, steady journey once again… until the final days.\n\nThe Hot Pink One, still Ina’s consort for the majority of the story, began to test the limits of Ina’s patience with her growing chaos. From the sudden announcement of her pregnancy, to escalating tensions between her and Tam Gandr (her other romantic entanglement), to Tam asking Ina to be her lover instead, and then the Pink One demanding that Ina be hers and hers alone—it all became too much for the potato-loving jeweler.\n\nAnd so, Ina made a decision. She would set off on her own journey—a path of reflection, seeking enlightenment, and asking herself where things had gone wrong… and whether her relationship with the Pink One was still something worth holding onto.",

Wherever she went, confusion and drama followed—specifically of the romantic variety. A magnet for affairs, this pink enigma drew women in just as easily as she pushed them away, thanks to her ever-perplexing personality.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Hot Pink One\n**Guild:** Cerulean Cup\n\nIn the first chapter, the Hot Pink One maintained an aloof, detached demeanor. While others got swept up in the kingdom’s wild affairs, she mostly meandered through her days with an air of nonchalance. Memory loss or not, she remained unapologetically herself—often ridiculed for the absurdities that escaped her mouth.\n\nStill, despite her relative inactivity compared to others, she quickly carved out a notorious reputation as a \"side chick magnet.\"\n\nAs early as Day 2, she had already claimed a wife—NinoIna—and, despite professing eternal loyalty to the purple one, continued to gather more women into her orbit. Four more, to be exact. She even attempted to ensnare a fifth: a memory-lost blonde searching for her beloved. A reminder that the pink one was a member of Cerulean Cup, the supposedly empathetic guild.\n\nCall it karma or collapse, but eventually, her polycule of side chicks unraveled, with only her eternal consort remaining at her side.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Hot Pink One\n**Job:** Chef\n\nIf Chapter 1 was wild, Chapter 2 showcased the full extent of the Hot Pink One’s chaotic energy. Even if she'd lost her memories again, her personality remained intact, as eccentric as ever, with her web of relationships becoming even more tangled.\n\nStill known as the Hot Pink One, she took on the role of a chef specializing in chocolate cakes and gradually recovered her memories—recalling herself as IRyS, the embodiment of hope, albeit a drunken one.\n\n[Recollection - IRyS](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uaWaQg4pnM)\n\nAnd as each day passed, the pink one's entanglement with others grew more and more complicated.\n\nNew threads formed: romantic, platonic, confusing—sometimes all three. She shared mouth-to-mouth meals with a pink cat, declared best friendship with Immerkind (or so the green one claimed), and became part of a peculiar cult known as the \"Inbread.\"\n\nHer familial side blossomed—with Koseki Bijou as her brother, endlessly devoted to her throughout the journey. Ina, her eternal consort, also remained steadfast as her romantic partner. And Tam Gandr, a new and passionate love interest, stood by her side, someone to constantly banter back and forth with.\n\nEverything was going great, until the last few days.\n\nNear the end, to escalate her already chaotic life, the pink one claimed to be pregnant. Bijou even hosted a gender reveal party, unveiling the baby’s gender as “Gas”—a result of many suspecting she was simply gassed up, not pregnant. The events that transpired afterwards shattered her bond with Tam, who then concluded the Hot Pink One wasn’t worth it. That led to an affair between Tam and Ina, which then led to Ina embarking on a journey of enlightenment, leaving the pink one devastated, spiraling into a yandere-like state.\n\nIf anyone followed the story from her perspective, it was easy to lose track of the actual objective everyone came here for.",

Despite her own occasional mishaps, she always tried her best to do follow her mind and heart no matter the cost.  \n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Tanakisha Karia of the Oranges, Shakira, The Savior of the Lesbians\n**Guild:** Amber Coin\n\nTanakisha Karia's purpose was sealed from the moment she had awakened -- to save the lesbians. Chapter 1 followed Shakira herself truly embracing her hero responsibilities, such as reporting to Queen Gandr regarding scam calls or instinctively venturing through the dangers of the dungeons to become the first to find treasure discs. \n\nShe rarely took nonsense from anyone else, confident and poised she was in her judgment. While she wasn't friends with everyone Even so, this pheonix found herself in need of a partner--someone to love and come home to.  In the end, she learned to continue moving forward on her own.\n\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Shakira, Kiara Takahashi\n**Job:** Smith\n\nShakira continued to keep her head held high in Chapter 2. She was assigned a new role in this chapter, to become a \"Lorekeeper\" alongside Mori Calliope whom she weirdly felt close feelings for. \n\nAs Shakira reached her lowest point towards the end of the chapter, she saw the light in a certain beeg cat. In a sudden twist of events, Kiara tied the knot with Roa with new-found admiration and love. This chapter ended in a wholesome note for the orange warrior. She earned the happy ending of her love story, what more could you ask for?",

She was notable for being a lottery addict in Chapter 1, helpless to the adrenaline that gambling gives her. One of the most chaotic and shameless of the bunch, it's a miracle how this mischievious dog learned from her poor financial decisions to become a hardworking jeweler and therapist in Chapter 2.   \n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Name:** Mococo Abyssguard\n**Guild:** Jade Sword\n\nMococo started out in quite a vulnerable state. Before Elizabeth vowed to be her protector and big sister, she felt frightened of this new world. She was easily persuaded to overspend in the Faunamart's lottery in spite the concerns of others. She soon turned into a problem, though, by extorting her friends for more money, thus damaging her relationships.\n\nNonetheless, there were hints that this troublemaker was much more than that. Her money-grubbing attitude has led her to realize that she *needed to work* for her money. Do business and such. Her sister and friends were also equally if not the most important to her. Mococo was scared to be alone truth be told. It was for the best she quit gambling (before returning through NanaEleven).\n\nHer journey was not smooth-sailing . This, also due the corruption that took over Mococo's mind and killed Fuwawa's chickens too\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n**Name:** Mococo Abyssguard\n**Job:** Jeweler\n\nChapter 2 presented Mococo an opportunity to start anew and forget her mistakes.  This jeweler was sort of a meddler herself— eavesdropping is her new hobby. \n\nOn the final day, Mococo, along with Fuwawa, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori, rejected Fia’s wish and chose to rebel.",

Her offbeat demeanor and unsettlingly unpredictable energy managed to spook not only a few of the other heroes, but even the voices in her head. No one could quite tell what she was doing or why she was doing it, but one thing was clear: she was adorable. And much like her green business partner, she’s now on the run from the authorities for a very familiar reason—scamming.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n**Names:** Cleopatra Eisenhower Da Vinci The Great III, Darwin Roosevelt DiCaprio Jr., Napoleon Galileo Aristotle Targaryen, Nanamoo\n**Guild:** Amber Coin\n\nNanamoo—or whatever she was called in her ever-growing list of names—began her journey like most others, with a peculiar obsession for horses, often making horse noises and sharing equine-related commentary. Though she was technically part of the Amber Coin guild, she spent most of her time with the Scarlet Wand bunch, earning herself an honorary title among the red ranks.\n\nShe also claimed to have never lost her memories to begin with, insisting she vividly remembered a past life full of Ferraris, loyal friends, running water, and undeniable coolness. Whether any of that was true remained deeply questionable. Her erratic ramblings—like randomly proclaiming a male knight to be pregnant—only fueled the belief that she might be a few marbles short.\n\nNanamoo’s rise to fame—or infamy—really began with the launch of her own store: _NanaEleven_. As FaunaMart’s first ~~victim~~ customer, she quickly caught on to the green CEO’s morally questionable practices and decided to challenge them—not by doing better, but by doing worse. Her version of “honest” business? Out-scamming the scammer.\n\nDespite the rivalry, the business war ended with the two swindlers shaking hands, forming an unlikely partnership in the name of profit. Together, Fauna and Nanamoo fled the kingdom with pockets full and reputations... complicated.\n\nHer journey was brief, chaotic, and incredibly silly—but one that left a lasting impression on all who crossed paths with the ever-horsing, ever-hustling Nanamoo.",

      "content": "## Overview\n\nIphania—now known as Fia—was once the Princess of Ancient Libestal, and now serves as the Librarian of the Library, the timeless sanctuary that lies beyond space and time. It was she who rescued the heroes from the destruction of the fabricated world, pulling them into the past not only to save their lives, but to ask a favor: to help her prevent the Outsider from ever coming into existence.\n\n## Details\n\n### Backstory\n\nLong ago in Ancient Libestal, the kingdom was ruled by Princess Iphania, the last of her royal bloodline. Both her parents, along with many close to her, had perished to the spreading corruption. The world was falling apart, and the Book of Prophecy foretold nothing but doom.\n\nDespite the grim prophecies, Iphania refused to yield to despair. She continued to fight with unwavering resolve—even if it meant defying fate itself. Her unshakable will moved the heart of **the Watcher**, a divine observer tasked only with watching worlds play out.\n\nBreaking his oath, the Watcher disguised himself as a swordsman—**the Outlander**—and fought to save the world at her side. Together, they succeeded: the Curse was slain, and the source of corruption destroyed.\n\nBut fate was cruel. A fragment of the Curse survived, hiding itself inside Iphania’s cherished doll. At the moment no one expected, it reemerged and struck her down. Though her body perished, Iphania’s soul lingered—clinging to the very doll that had caused her demise, and which now bore her spirit within.\n\nAs the world crumbled into ruin, her soul drifted through space and time, eventually finding refuge in the Library. The sanctuary preserved her essence, though in exchange, she could never leave. Taking on the name **Fia**—a nickname once given to her by the Outlander—she became the Library's eternal caretaker.\n\nBound within those walls, Fia could do little but reflect—on her kingdom’s fall, the Outlander’s punishment—the cycle of despair that led to **the Outsider’s** creation. She longed to save them both, but was powerless. That is, until she saw them—the heroes, her Shining Stars.\n\nWith new hope, she summoned them into the past, to a time one week before the pivotal moment of her world’s doom, praying they could succeed where she could not.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\nUpon first meeting the heroes, Fia explained the truth: the King they once knew was a fraud—the Outsider, who sought to destroy the universe. She begged for their aid, though she herself could not recall all the details, having lost fragments of her memory due to the strain of time travel.\n\nShe asked the heroes to help her recover what had been lost.\nAnd so, they did.\n\nTheir journey took them through Ancient Libestal, where they met Iphania’s past self—a princess still fighting to defy destiny. Through dungeons, Star Sites, and battles, the heroes slowly pieced together Fia’s lost memories. With clarity regained, she proposed a new path: let the heroes take up the Outlander’s burden of saving the world, so that he would not be punished, and the Outsider would never be born.\n\nThe heroes shared the truth with Iphania, who, alongside them, convinced the Outlander to relinquish his fate. He agreed. And the plan worked—they defeated the Curse and saved Libestal.\n\nBut just as victory was within reach, fate struck again.\nThe Curse reemerged during the celebration banquet, slaying Iphania in one final, merciless act.\n\nThen, a higher and far more cryptic being appeared—shattering space itself. It condemned the Outlander for abandoning his divine role, and the heroes for interfering with fate. Their punishment was imminent.\n\nBut Fia intervened, pulling the heroes back into the Library once more and leaping through time to escape the entity’s grasp. With this final time jump, all of her memories returned—her life as the Princess of Libestal, her tragic death, and how she came about as the current Librarian.\n\nHistory had repeated itself. Once again, she had failed to break fate.\n\nYet even now, she refused to give in. This time, rather than change the past, she asked the heroes to help her change the future. To do what they still could—here and now—and carve a new path forward.\n\nMost of the heroes agreed without hesitation.\nBut not all.\n**Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori** chose to stay behind, unable—or unwilling—to follow Fia any further.",

      "content": "## Overview\n\nThe Outsider was the one who first summoned all the heroes to the fabricated Kingdom of Libestal—posing as the benevolent king—deceiving them into freeing him from his ancient bindings. A being consumed by hatred and resentment toward the forces that once imprisoned him, he sought nothing less than the destruction of the universe as revenge. The heroes were the only ones standing in his way.\n\n## Details\n\n### Chapter 1\n\nNineteen heroes were summoned to the Kingdom of Libestal by its seemingly kind and gentle ruler. The king pleaded for their strength to save his realm from the growing threat of the Stains. His demeanor was compassionate, his motives appeared noble—and it was all a lie.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Stain King, the monarch revealed his true identity. The so-called calamity had been orchestrated by him, and by defeating it, the heroes had unknowingly broken the seals on his prison. No longer bound, he shed his disguise and revealed his true form—**The Captive** (later known as **the Outsider**)\n\nHis intent was clear—to destroy all of existence as retribution for his imprisonment. But through the combined efforts of the heroes, he was ultimately struck down. However, as he fell, the very world began to collapse into the void. In the final moments, a mysterious entity intervened, pulling the heroes from the brink of annihilation.\n\n### Chapter 2\n\nThe heroes were pulled back in time by **Fia** to the ancient era of Libestal—an age before the Outsider’s existence—in hopes of preventing his tragic birth altogether.\n\nDuring their journey, they encountered a wandering, nameless swordsman, **the Outlander**, who was on his own mission to destroy the Heart of Ruin, the wellspring of corruption plaguing the land.\n\n#### The Nameless Swordsman\n\n**The Outlander**\nDriven by purpose and haunted by knowledge, the Outlander fought to rid the world of its impending doom. However, during an expedition into the Stronghold of Ruin, he was overtaken by the corruption and sealed within. The heroes, dispatched by Princess Iphania, were able to conquer the dungeon and free him.\n\nDespite his rescue, the Outlander remained distant, skeptical of their resolve. He believed the burden of salvation fell solely upon him. Unbeknownst to him, that belief would lead to his downfall.\n\n**The Watcher**\nEventually, his true identity was revealed: he was **The Watcher**, a member of the Collective, tasked only with observing worlds unfold—never intervening. Yet he had broken this sacred code. Inspired by Iphania’s bravery despite her doomed fate, he chose to abandon his post and rewrite the outcome, assuming the role of a nameless swordsman in order to defy destiny itself.\n\n**The Outsider**\nFor this defiance, he was punished by the _Higher Being_—imprisoned for eternity within a fabricated reflection of the very kingdom he tried to save. As centuries passed, resentment turned to madness, and from that despair, the Outsider was born.\n\n#### The Price for Defying Fate\n\nAfter learning his fate and seeing the strength of the heroes firsthand, the Outlander relinquished his role. Trusting them with the task of saving the world, he stepped back. And they succeeded—slaying the Curse, destroying the Heart of Ruin, and restoring peace.\n\nBut fate, it seemed, was not so easily undone. In a cruel twist, the Curse reemerged in its final moments and struck down Princess Iphania. The Outlander, devastated by grief, faced judgment once again. The mysterious Higher Being, who had been watching from beyond, declared that his betrayal of the Collective irreversible. Imprisonment awaited him still. The cycle could not be broken—the Outsider would still be born.\n\nNow, with the universe at stake and the truth of the past fully unveiled, the heroes must face their greatest challenge yet: stopping the Outsider once and for all.",
