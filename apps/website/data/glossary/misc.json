    "content": "## Overview\n\nAside from the usual questing, the heroes could take some time off to relax and refresh their minds by participating in the kingdom’s minigames. These ranged from simple tests of strength and intelligence to losing all your savings betting on a color.\n\n## Details\n\nThere are currently **four minigames**, each originally introduced in **Chapter 1**, with every game initially representing one of the four guilds—each minigame reflecting its respective guild's ideology (only in Chapter 1).\n\n### **Color Cannon**\n\n**Appearance:** Chapter 1, Chapter 2\n**Representing Guild:** Amber Coin\n\nA game of chance and tension. Players place wagers on any of four available colors:\n\n- **Blue** (x2 multiplier) – 12 positions\n- **Green** (x3 multiplier) – 8 positions\n- **Yellow** (x5 multiplier) – 4 positions\n- **Red** (x10 multiplier) – 1 position\n\nOnce the game begins, colors are eliminated one by one on a large board until only one color remains. Those who bet on the final surviving color receive their wager multiplied accordingly. High risk, high reward.\n\n[Color Cannon Gameplay (Chapter 1)](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?si=eJcASEwHtt_fSBxP&t=12469)\n\n[Color Cannon Gameplay (Chapter 2)](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/MXqotm_8_Hc?si=aoEyEg-xEFfmpp35&t=1333)\n\n---\n\n### **Duel Arena**\n\n**Appearance:** Chapter 1, Chapter 2\n**Representing Guild:** Jade Sword\n\nA test of strength, reflex, and endurance. Two challengers face off using only wooden swords, and the match continues until one remains standing.\n\nIn Chapter 2, an added rule ensures the match ends in a draw if both participants are still standing after one minute. Furthermore, they could also place bets on which side they thought would come out victorious.\n\n[Duel Arena Gameplay (Chapter 1)](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?si=F2tIDZ3UomJm6BL8&t=7495)\n\n[Duel Arena Gameplay (Chapter 2)](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/AxQVdUrmVZU?si=XZIwaC0gGcvRERuX&t=7524)\n\n---\n\n### **Mind’s Eye**\n\n**Appearance:** Chapter 1\n**Representing Guild:** Scarlet Wand\n\nA memory-based minigame where four players compete to recreate a color arrangement shown for a few seconds. Each correct color grants **+1 point**, and perfectly recreating a full arrangement awards bonus points based on the number of colors involved, while incorrect guesses deduct **-5 points**. As rounds progress, the difficulty increases with more complex patterns and color combinations. The player with the highest score at the end wins.\n\n[Mind's Eye Gameplay](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/iAYrdIlfVf0?si=IgyQ30f4CcuBKzPA&t=4445)\n\n---\n\n### **Chicken Rescue**\n\n**Appearance:** Chapter 1\n**Representing Guild:** Cerulean Cup\n\nA solo challenge where the player must control a basket to catch chickens falling from the sky on a 2D grid. Basket movement mirrors the player’s own movements. The objective is to catch as many chickens as possible within the time limit of one minute. Scores are recorded on a leaderboard, encouraging repeat attempts and competition.\n\n[Chicken Rescue Gameplay](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Rd0awHHBTiA?si=hio6f__WZ_dYMMTq&t=6662)\n\n_Note: You can try out Color Cannon, Mind's Eye, and Chicken Rescue yourself on ENreco Archive_",

    "content": "## Overview\n\nIn Chapter 2, a sidequest allowed the heroes to request a portrait of themselves from an artist named Pygmalion. These portraits were special—they were selected entries from the **#ENrecoCanvas** campaign, a fan art event that ran from `March 1st to March 19th, 2025`, prior to the start of Chapter 2.\n\n## Details\n\nTo receive a portrait, the heroes needed to help Pygmalion by gathering a set of materials. The task was intentionally a bit tedious, as it encouraged cooperation among the heroes. Each item was tied to a specific profession, meaning players had to seek out others in those roles:\n\n- **5 Raw Iron, 5 Raw Copper** – obtainable only from a Supplier\n- **1 Butter** – from a Chef\n- **1 Basic Upgrade Stone** – from a Smith\n- **1 Basic Azure Charm** – from a Jeweler\n\nThis quest acted not only as a way to earn a personalized portrait but also as a clever method to promote player interaction and teamwork early in Chapter 2.\n\nEach hero's portrait was unique, both in art style and in the story it portrayed, capturing something personal and special about that character—making the reward as memorable as it was meaningful.\n\n## Credits\n\n- Portrait of Mordan Ramsey - [nino](https://x.com/2nochuu/status/1902511940938952880)\n- Portrait of Tanakisha Karia - [DDOLBANG](https://x.com/DDOLBANG11/status/1901809462907896270/photo/1)\n- Portrait of Nino Ina - [Yuki Azuya](https://x.com/YukiAzuyaYuki/status/1897289589376815208/photo/1)\n- Portrait of Tam Gandr - [Raichi](https://x.com/KirisakiLychee/status/1902258670706237921)\n- Portrait of the Hot Pink One - [Wynnie](https://x.com/WynnTerra_/status/1902017659547353299)\n- Portrait of Peasant Da Bae - [Miku](https://x.com/Mikururun/status/1899107067182411936/photo/1)\n- Portrait of Shiori Nyavella - [the baker I am](https://x.com/imabaker111/status/1901017602388095009)\n- Portrait of Nerissa Ravencroft - [sumo](https://x.com/sumo88_/status/1900190544602734862)\n- Portrait of Fuwawa Abyssguard - [Hiro](https://x.com/hiroavrs/status/1902520304167203278/photo/1)\n- Portrait of Mococo Abyssguard\n- Portrait of Koseki Bijou - [Dr.Pigieon PhD](https://x.com/PhdPigeon/status/1896821416395436357)\n- Portrait of Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame - [otashishi](https://x.com/ashiartwork/status/1900196831394668961)\n- Portrait of Gonathon G - [Gardener](https://x.com/jhgardener_/status/1901266522120794617)\n- Portrait of Cecilia Immerkind - [Mittsu](https://x.com/MittsumiA/status/1902371897985397070/photo/1)\n- Portrait of Roa Pandora - [kit](https://x.com/quartzquadrant/status/1902200030980649355)",
