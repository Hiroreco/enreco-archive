      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Unlocked on:** Day 7\n\nThe **Heart of Ruin** was the final dungeon—and the ultimate challenge the heroes faced in Chapter 2, as this was the source of all corruption, the root cause of the kingdom’s decay. Destroying it meant not only completing the mission for which the heroes were summoned but also saving the world from ruin itself.\n\nYet, it quickly became clear that this victory would come at a cost, as some of their comrades had become more vulnerable to the corruption than anyone had expected.\n\n## Details\n\n**The Cursed Ones**\nUnlike the dungeons before it, the Heart of Ruin featured no puzzles or quizzes.\n\nThe heroes began their journey in a darkened library, where a select few among them—**Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori**—were revealed to be [cursed](https://www.youtube.com/live/FlPFFE5_X3Y?si=X225RDkHgfG9S-lA&t=8877), having succumbed to the corruption. Twisted by its influence, they turned against the rest of the party, [hindering](https://www.youtube.com/live/FlPFFE5_X3Y?si=Y0CkESZCjPvnlNT4&t=9221) their progress and becoming obstacles on the path forward. The remaining heroes were tasked with purifying their friends.\n\nWithin this first library was a book titled _“Prelude of Ruin,”_ hinting at the events and powers that brought the kingdom to its current state.\n\n[Read \"Prelude of Ruin\"](#text:prelude-of-ruin)\n\nProgressing onward, the heroes were thrown into a series of arenas where they fought off waves of Stains, each victory building up **Purification Energy**. The goal was to fill this energy meter to cleanse their corrupted comrades. However, their progress was threatened by trap-laden terrain and attacks from their cursed allies, which would drain the energy meter and delay their rescue.\n\nOnly once the meter was filled could each corrupted hero [be freed](https://www.youtube.com/live/FlPFFE5_X3Y?si=gTrix4HT7CG7-0Xx&t=9250) and return to the group.\n\n---\n\n**The Final Battle**\n\nDeeper into the dungeon, another library awaited. There, the heroes found the book titled _“Song of Ruin,”_ which detailed the tragic fate of the former King and Queen, as well as the source behind such fate.\n\n[Read \"Song of Ruin\"](#text:song-of-ruin)\n\nFinally, at the end of the path, the heroes stood before their last enemy: **The Curse** — the very essence of corruption, the entity that had infected the kingdom and threatened to bring everything to its knees.\n\nDefeating this entity meant liberation: of the land, of the Princess, and of the Outlander, who both offered their heartfelt gratitude after the battle.\n\n[The battle against The Curse](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/mb91g7vQSnA?si=aPXghWa1h648PaCG&t=6678)\n\nBut this was not the end.\nAs the heroes would soon learn, the events on the final day would change everything.\nThis chapter had closed, but the story was far from over.\n\n### Sources\n\n- World Builder - [tskai_xx](https://x.com/tskai_xx/status/1921298594185036164/photo/1)\n- Concept Art - [R_E_C_flctiond](https://x.com/R_E_C_flctiond/status/1921068336151957890)",

Fittingly, the memories it contained belonged to none other than the embodiment of chaos herself—[Hakos Baelz](#entry:bae-entry).\n\n## Details\n\n### Games\n\nUnlike the earlier dungeons where puzzles were the main focus, the primary gimmick of this dungeon was a collection of minigames determined by spinning a roulette wheel. Player performance in these games was tracked by a **luck meter**—the better the performance, the more luck gained.\n\nThere were five different minigames, each with its own unique objective.\n\n**Shaky Floor Showdown**\nPlayers must defeat as many Stains as possible while [the floor](https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=ehUP_KK9qRn2DrzW&t=4127) collapses beneath them with each step. The game ends when all players fall.\n\n**Balloon Pop**\nPlayers are given [colored balls](https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=ZN4CDNF33MknO8Qa&t=8297) and must match them to the corresponding colored balloons, popping as many as possible within the time limit.\n\n**Blind Round**\nPlayers must [push a button](https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=byW4Jzn2G2E6zxj2&t=8083) across a pit by using platforms that appear and disappear in intervals. The more presses within the time limit, the better the score.\n\n**Boss Room?**\nA [deceptive room](https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=8feoLm3SloHkkDFp&t=4581) where attacking the talking Stain causes the party to gain no luck. Avoid the bait.\n\n**Cutout Match**\nPlayers receive three [colored blocks](https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=E8tnJXeN4Tp4hmHt&t=4740) and must build a structure that matches the incoming wall’s hole pattern and color.\n\nAt the end, players face the true boss: **Stain King Chaos**, a battle riddled with RNG mechanics. The final phase includes a roulette wheel where higher accumulated luck increases the chance of landing on green. Winning this spin opens a cage containing a music disc.\n\n[Stain King Chaos Fight](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=wWfwJ_k0ugG8B9oW&t=4954)\n\n### Rewards\n\n- **\"Play Dice\"** – a music disc by Hakos Baelz\n- **Memories of Hakos Baelz**\n\n[Recollection - Hakos Baelz](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSFZwinYaaU)\n\n### Sources\n\n- World Builder - [tskai_xx](https://x.com/tskai_xx/status/1921298173123076248)\n- Concept Art - [R_E_C_flctiond](https://x.com/R_E_C_flctiond/status/1922200389815882127/photo/1)",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Day Unlocked:** 4\n\n**Star Site: Chronos** was the second of the three star sites in Chapter 2, and it set itself apart with a strong central theme: _time_. This dungeon contained the memories of none other than the Warden of Time herself, [Ouro Kronii](#entry:kronii-entry), and, as expected, the puzzles and mechanics were all built around the manipulation of time.\n\n## Details\n\n### Puzzles\n\nThe dungeon introduced its main mechanic immediately: each room presented a short **10-second timer** to complete an objective. A central device called the **timer block** allowed the players to manipulate this timer in various ways—**playing**, **pausing**, **rewinding**, or **resetting** time depending on the challenge.\n\n**First Puzzle**\n\nA simple challenge to ease the group in: make it [across a gap](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=Wl_THIyIf_zPzyLC&t=686) before the timer runs out. The timer block here only allows restarting the countdown.\n\n**Second Puzzle**\n\nA maze with [moving walls](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=uw5ysU_bCtSsY0Vo&t=765) that close when the timer hits zero. Resetting the timer reopens the walls. Players must navigate through the maze and press all floor buttons to unlock the next area.\n\n**Third Puzzle**\n\nSet inside a clock tower, this room features [four mirrors](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=9ipSXdXbJZx-cklg&t=1222) mounted on pillars. When play is pressed, the timer block emits a beam of light that can be paused in midair. By rotating and angling the mirrors, the team must reflect the light to hit a target tile above the door to progress. Pausing and restarting the light beam is essential to success.\n\n**Fourth Puzzle**\n\nHigher in the clocktower is a [colored wall maze](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=vWL35RPlcj3FKtwZ&t=1850): six different colored walls can be raised by pressing corresponding buttons. These walls reset when the timer ends, and the timer block allows pausing and playing. The group must first locate a vine that leads above the walls, and then raise the correct walls to reach the exit.\n\nExploration here also reveals secret cracked blocks—when the green wall is raised, players can break through the cracks to unlock a shortcut back to the mirror room. Using the mirrors and pillars again allows traversal to another breakable wall, hiding a chest with the dungeon's music disc.\n\n**Fifth Puzzle**\n\nBy far the most complex challenge in the dungeon. A massive [multi-layered maze](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=hccb2ghDRdj1nsgO&t=2636) with moving platforms, fenced walls, and cube structures embedded with colored buttons. The timer block now supports rewinding and moving platforms between positions. Players must:\n\n- Rewind or play to position platforms correctly\n- Press buttons to open colored gates\n- Use precise platforming to traverse tight paths and reach the exit\n\nThis final puzzle tests everything learned in the dungeon: logic, timing, teamwork, and movement.\n\n**Final Boss – Stain King Chronos**\n\nThe boss fight cleverly incorporates the time gimmick. Chronos summons pillars with numbers on top, and players must set the timer block to the matching number in order to destroy the pillar and make the boss vulnerable.\n\nChronos can also rewind its own health bar, healing back damage taken, forcing players to act quickly and precisely to avoid wasting time or effort.\n\n[Stain King Chronos Fight](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=DutQY97bg-9L372Q&t=3734)\n\n### Rewards\n\n- **\"Daydream\"** – a music disc by Ouro Kronii\n- **Memories of Ouro Kronii**\n\n[Recollection - Ouro Kronii](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV7dgz75tVo)\n\n### Sources\n\n- World Builder - [tskai_xx](https://x.com/tskai_xx/status/1920402035117338696/photo/1)\n- Concept Art - [R_E_C_flctiond](https://x.com/R_E_C_flctiond/status/1921475614206505098/photo/1)",

He, too, had been investigating the stronghold—only to fall victim to the lingering corruption that trapped him inside. Thanks to the heroes' efforts in conquering the dungeon, he was ultimately freed.\n\n## Details\n\n### Puzzles\n\nUpon entering, the party was granted a checkpoint system and 5 shared lives, setting the tone for the challenging trials ahead.\n\n**First Challenge**\n\nThe dungeon began with a gauntlet of [stain-filled arenas](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=Yz9FvKwuZtv4e-ZS&t=1423). Each arena required the party to defeat all spawned stains before the gates would open and allow them to move forward, and the fights escalated in intensity as they progressed.\n\n**Second Challenge**\n\nNext, the party encountered artifacts represented as black roses. To advance meant destroying those roses, and in order to do so, the heroes needed to first solve puzzles:\n\n- One puzzle involved a series of [math problems](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=kbaxo2QGrPfrE5La&t=2999).\n- The other required solving a sequence [memory lock](https://www.youtube.com/live/Lp7GyRVbz1c?si=eZeTfPLnxXrZZVP7&t=2892).\n\nAll the while, stains continued to spawn endlessly, making puzzle-solving a frantic and dangerous task until all the black roses were destroyed.\n\n**Intermission**\n\nProgressing further, the heroes entered a quiet but eerie library, where they discovered a riddle etched into a hidden corner of the room:\n\n> _\"The heart is distant, under lock and key\n> And hides in corners far from enemy.\"_\n\n**Final Challenge**\n\nThe last room housed **Stain King Proto**, guarding a crystal linked to something greater—the [Heart of Ruin](#entry:heart-of-ruin-entry), an as-yet unrevealed location that would eventually come into play.\n\nThe arena was surrounded by four more black roses, one in each corner, each protected by the same types of puzzles encountered earlier (math and memory).

Their new task was to perform a \"ritual\" to purify a book essential for the next stage of their journey.\n\n## Details\n\n### Puzzle\n\nThe ritual was structured as a social deduction game. Each participant was assigned a number and a topic.\n\nThey had to devise a word that reflected the magnitude of their assigned number (small or large) to determine the correct seating order.\n\nOne participant was \"Cursed\" and sought to sabotage the purification without being discovered.\n\nThe ritual could be completed by either correctly seating everyone in numerical order or by identifying and voting out the Cursed individual.\n\n[The Ritual](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/tJ_YXGE3o2w?si=PuRoJPyk6DJCIjQC&t=5809)\n\n### Rewards\n\n- **\"The Truth of Ruin\"** Book\n\n[Read \"The Truth of Ruin\"](#text:the-truth-of-ruin)",
