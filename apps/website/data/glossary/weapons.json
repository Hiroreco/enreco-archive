      "content": "## Overview\n\n**Purrfect Execution**, a playful yet unmistakably intimidating name, is the title of the razor-sharp mechanical claw wielded by Raora Panthera on her journey through Libestal.\n\n## Details\n\nRaora is a panther — a _pink_ one at that. Fierce, relentless, and full of sass. She runs on coffee, harbors a deep disdain for tea, and was once a proud agent of Justice... until her memories were lost and she entered a chaotic rivalry with Tam, boldly crowning herself “Queen Mario.”\n\nDespite all that, her claw still reflects the prowess of a deadly feline. When activated, Raora is launched into the air, executing rapid claw strikes while orbiting around her target — slashing through multiple enemies like a cat expertly pouncing on its prey.\n\n[Big cat means big slashes](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?si=8Pej7LP6Am3NbGSa&t=6746)",

After all, it’s a giant metal fork roughly the size of a person.\n\nIts ability is straightforward: when activated, it emits an area-of-effect sonar blast at the target location, creating a resonant explosion. However, Nerissa doesn’t usually pay attention to the AoE nature of the weapon—instead, she tends to just slam the fork directly onto her target, essentially bonking them into oblivion.\n\n[\\*\\*Ringing bonk sfx\\*\\*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/DDwNcYCtAXw?feature=shared&t=1628)",
