      "content": "## Overview\n\nAncient Libestal, unlike the fabricated kingdom the heroes were summoned to in the first chapter, was a real version of Libestal—set in a time before [the Outsider](#entry:outsider-entry) came into being. It was here that the heroes began their second journey, with the objective to stop the Ruination, destroy the source of the corruption, and ultimately save the world as well as the universe.\n\n[Read \"Kingdom of Libestal (Ancient)\"](#text:libestal)\n\n## Details\n\n### Preface\n\nAs the Captive was defeated and the fabricated world designed to contain him slowly crumbled away, a mysterious voice saved the heroes from the dying realm. That voice belonged to Fia, the current caretaker of the Library, who brought the heroes back in time to an earlier, real Libestal. Her hope was that the heroes, now known as the Shining Stars, could prevent the Outsider, an entity of pure hatred destined to destroy the universe, from ever coming into existence.\n\n### Setting\n\nAncient Libestal, as its name implies, was set in a distant past, reflected in its antique architecture and atmosphere. The kingdom served as the last sanctuary for the world’s inhabitants, as the rest of the land was slowly being consumed by the Ruination. Stains ravaged the wilderness, and death was ever-present. Unlike the previous Libestal, there were no guilds here. Instead, the kingdom’s survival relied on four core occupations:\n\n- **The Smith** – Forged upgrade stones used to enhance Revelation weapons.\n- **The Jeweler** – Crafted charms that enhanced health and bolstered defense.\n- **The Chef** – Cooked meals that granted powerful buffs for exploration and combat.\n- **The Supplier** – Enchanted tools to improve resource-gathering efficiency.\n\nOne noticeable difference between the fabricated and the real Libestal was how alive everything felt. Citizens were plentiful, and wherever the heroes went, they encountered new faces to interact with.\n\n### Appearance\n\nFrom above, the kingdom had a compact layout, with buildings made mostly of mud brick, adding to its ancient charm. While familiar structures such as a castle and residential areas remained, they differed significantly from their counterparts in the fabricated Libestal.\n\n**The Castle**\nThe largest structure in the kingdom, the castle focused on height rather than width. It housed the Princess, numerous workers, and many refugees, instantly making it feel far more alive than the vacant halls of the previous castle.\n\nWithin the castle grounds were a variety of facilities, including the Princess's chambers, a dining hall, a dueling area, a casino, merchant stalls, and more. Most kingdom activities and sidequests took place here.\n\n**The Library**\nLocated at the center of the residential area and directly in front of the castle gates, the Library was a central hub of the second chapter’s story and the place where Fia resided.\n\n**Build Area**\nSurrounding the Library were expansive plots of land allocated to the heroes for free building. Compared to the limited, guild-restricted building areas in the first chapter, this iteration offered far more freedom and fewer restrictions, allowing for grander, more personalized structures.\n\n### Quests\n\nBoth side and main quests returned, with expanded depth and limitations to prevent previous exploits (such as earning tens of thousands of coins from mass-producing potato salad). Sidequests still served as a source of income and power-ups, while main quests progressed the storyline and restored lost memories—this time not just of the heroes, but also of Fia.\n\nCertain sidequests now had level requirements, encouraging progression and role specialization before access.\n\n### Remnants\n\nAs the story advanced, new regions called Remnants became accessible, offering new materials, enemies, story content, and challenges that demanded real teamwork. These areas were:\n\n- **Remnants of the Cliffs of Sidero** – Unlocked early after choosing occupations and finishing initial quests.\n- **Remnants of the Lykeion Campus** – Unlocked after conquering Star Site: Elpis.\n- **Remnants of the Antigonian Aerie** – Unlocked after conquering Star Site: Chronos.\n\n### Star Sites\n\nAs in the previous chapter, the heroes needed to clear dungeons to recover their memories and progress the story. These were known as Star Sites:\n\n- **Star Site: Elpis** – Unlocked on Day 2; contained IRyS's memories.\n- **Star Site: Chronos** – Unlocked on Day 4; contained Ouro Kronii's memories.\n- **Star Site: Chaos** – Unlocked on Day 5; contained Hakos Baelz's memories.\n\n### Other Quests\n\nIn addition to Star Sites, two major dungeons served as key plot events:\n\n- **Stronghold of Ruin** – Unlocked on Day 3; where the heroes first encountered and freed the Outlander.\n- **Heart of Ruin** – Unlocked on Day 7; the final dungeon where the source of all evil, the Curse, was destroyed.\n\nBefore entering the Heart of Ruin, the heroes undertook a special quest on Day 6 titled **The Ritual**, which served as a narrative bridge into the finale.\n\n### Ending\n\nAfter defeating the Heart of Ruin and saving the world, the heroes joined the kingdom's citizens for a grand victory banquet. Just as the celebration peaked, tragedy struck: the Princess was assassinated by the Curse, which had somehow survived. A mysterious higher being appeared, ready to punish the heroes for “defying fate.”\n\nIn the final moment, Fia intervened, transporting the heroes back to the Library to escape annihilation.\n\nWith sorrow, Fia acknowledged that preventing the Outsider’s birth was impossible. The only path forward now was to prevent whatever his intentions were in the present—and that meant Libestal was doomed. Ancient Libestal fell, marking its inevitable demise.",

      "content": "## Overview\n\n**The Kingdom of Libestal** was where the heroes were first summoned by the [King](#entry:outsider-entry), marking the beginning of their enigmatic journey. They were brought forth with the objective of defending the kingdom from a mysterious threat known as the [Stains](#entry:stains-entry). However, it was later revealed that the kingdom itself was a fabrication—a guise for a prison holding the King, whose true identity was The Captive (the Outsider). In a grand deception, the Captive had tricked the heroes into releasing him.\n\n[Read \"Kingdom of Libestal (Ficta)\"](#text:libestal-ficta)\n\n## Details\n\n### Preface\n\nNineteen heroes were summoned to a mysterious kingdom by its King, each stripped of their memories. Recognizing them as the destined saviors foretold by the power of their Revelation, the King urged them to grow stronger and unite in order to defeat the looming threat of the Stain King—and, in doing so, save the kingdom.\n\n### Setting\n\nLibestal was set in a somewhat medieval, though not archaic—fantasy world. Magical devices and enchanted weaponry were commonplace. The kingdom’s citizens, known as Libestans, were rabbit-like humanoids, and the realm was ruled by the King. Four [guilds](#entry:guilds-entry) served as pillars of the kingdom’s structure, each tasked with different duties, and the heroes were assigned to one of them:\n\n- **Jade Sword** – A beacon of righteousness and loyalty, where great threats are met with even greater courage.\n- **Cerulean Cup** – A sanctum of healing, where empathy and devotion flourish.\n- **Amber Coin** – A haven for glory-seekers and visionaries, where the closest allies could become the fiercest rivals.\n- **Scarlet Wand** – A refuge for the curious, where knowledge and creativity are held above all else.\n\nDespite the kingdom’s scale, many heroes remarked on how empty it felt—its vast size contrasting with its sparse population.\n\n### Appearance\n\nThe kingdom was vast and diverse in its architecture, with clear distinctions between major and minor structures. It could be divided into four key zones:\n\n- **Guild Headquarters** – Each guild’s headquarters housed its respective guild master and reflected their philosophy. For example, Jade Sword’s area included dueling arenas, while Amber Coin featured a casino.\n\n- **Free Build Area** – A sandbox-like zone where heroes could build shops, homes, or anything else they desired. This area was subdivided by guild, with each guild’s members allotted specific land plots. Building heights and depths were restricted, and heroes could only fly and construct within their assigned territory.\n\n- **The Castle** – The largest structure in the kingdom and the King’s residence. Constructed mainly from quartz, the Castle had a clean, bright, and grand appearance. Despite its imposing architecture, many of its halls were eerily empty—only the throne room saw consistent use.\n\n- **Miscellaneous Areas** – Additional zones included gardens, shopping buildings, and residential structures for the kingdom's occupants.\n\nWithin the kingdom’s walls, the environment was safe. Outside lay the wilderness, teeming with Stains, materials, and dungeons for the heroes to explore.\n\n### Quests\n\nHeroes advanced through the story via two types of quests:\n\n- **Side Quests** – Routine tasks such as cooking or gathering resources. Completing these quests rewarded coins and useful artifacts. They were repeatable and served as a way to gain materials and build up strength.\n\n- **Main Quests** – Essential story-driven objectives, focused mainly on conquering five dungeons. Each completed main quest restored a portion of the heroes’ lost memories and strengthened their Revelation. Dungeons were unlocked progressively each day.\n\n### Plot Twist and Demise\n\nAfter defeating the Stain King on Day 8, the truth unraveled: the King had been evil all along. The kingdom was merely a prison to contain him, and the heroes had unknowingly set him free. His true identity, The Captive, or The Outsider, was revealed, and his release brought the fabricated world to its breaking point. Though the heroes ultimately defeated the Captive, the world itself began to collapse, disintegrating back into the void.\n\nOnly through the intervention of a mysterious being were the heroes rescued, leading directly into the events of Chapter 2.",

The [King of Libestal](#entry:outlander-entry) proclaimed that these Revelations were the key to saving the world from the Calamity, and urged the heroes to lend their strength in doing so.\n\n### Abilities\n\nEach Revelation possessed a unique ability, ranging from blazing projectiles to gem-like bursts. After activation, abilities entered a cooldown phase of one minute before they could be used again.\n\nWith each dungeon conquered, the heroes’ Revelations grew stronger, a change marked visually by increasingly brilliant sparkles surrounding the weapon.\n\nIn Chapter 2, Revelations received a significant upgrade. Not only were their powers enhanced, but they could also be wielded as melee weapons—unlike in Chapter 1, where they functioned purely as activated abilities. Additionally, each Revelation gained a basic ranged attack that could be used repeatedly without cooldown.\n\n### The Heroes and Their Revelations\n\nEach hero wielded a unique Revelation—distinct in both form and function—based on their past selves and forgotten identities:\n\n- **Gawr Gura** – [Oceanic Terror](#entry:oceanic-terror-entry), a trident\n\n- **Mori Calliope** – [Rest In Peace](#entry:rest-in-peace-entry), a scythe\n\n- **Amelia Watson** – [Eye of Wisdom](#entry:eye-of-wisdom-entry), a magnifying glass\n\n- **Takanashi Kiara** – [Burning Phoenix](#entry:burning-phoenix-entry), a fiery sword and shield\n\n- **Ninomae Ina'nis** – [Violet Miasma](#entry:violet-miasma-entry), a book with cryptic runes\n\n- **Nanamoo** – [Winds of Civilization](#entry:winds-of-civilization-entry), a short blade\n\n- **Ceres Fauna** – [Nature's Grace](#entry:natures-grace-entry), a golden apple\n\n- **Hakos Baelz** – [Chaos Stampede](#entry:chaos-stampede-entry), a dice\n\n- **Ouro Kronii** – [Chrono Surge](#entry:chrono-surge-entry), dual clock hands\n\n- **IRyS** – [Light and Darkness](#entry:light-and-darkness-entry), a pair of black and white stars\n\n- **Fuwawa Abyssguard** – [Azure Claws](#entry:azure-claws-entry), sharp blue claws\n\n- **Mococo Abyssguard** – [Fuchsia Claws](#entry:fuchsia-claws-entry), sharp pink claws\n\n- **Koseki Bijou** – [Shining Emotions](#entry:shining-emotions-entry), a gem\n\n- **Nerissa Ravencroft** – [Resonant Strike](#entry:resonant-strike-entry), a tuning fork\n\n- **Shiori Novella** – [Bookmark of Memories](#entry:bookmark-of-memories-entry), a quill\n\n- **Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame** – [Thorn of Justice](#entry:thorn-of-justice-entry), a claymore\n\n- **Gonathon G** – [Gremlin Grenade](#entry:gremlin-grenade-entry), a pair of metal fists\n\n- **Cecilia Immergreen** – [Automaton Assault](#entry:automaton-assault-entry), a lance\n\n- **Raora Panthera** – [Purrfect Execution](#entry:purrfect-execution-entry), a mechanical claw",

      "content": "## Overview\n\nStains served as the main antagonists throughout much of the story, driving the heroes forward in their journey to overcome evil and restore balance to the world.\n\n## Details\n\n### Appearance\n\nStains took the form of shadowy creatures of various shapes, sizes, and species—some wielded swords, some walked on two legs, others on four, some flew, and some resembled crystalline beings. Despite these differences, they all shared a defining trait: a shroud of darkness and a glowing, purple, symbol-like pattern across their faces. Each species of Stain had its own distinct abilities used to attack the heroes.\n\nWhen defeated, Stains dropped coins and valuable materials essential to the heroes' progression—ingredients for cooking, crafting tools, and enhancing their [Revelation](#entry:revelations-entry) weapons.\n\nInterestingly, the heroes once noted how Stains emitted sounds similar to whimpering puppies upon death, which made some feel uneasy about slaying them.\n\n### Stories and Origin\n\n#### Chapter 1\n\nIn the first journey, the heroes were tasked with defending the kingdom from the invading Stains. Little was initially known about these creatures, other than their malevolent nature and their relentless aggression toward the heroes and the world.\n\nAt the forefront of this invasion stood the **Stain King**—a larger, more formidable Stain. However, it was eventually revealed that this Stain King was a false monarch, merely a key piece in a fabricated kingdom designed to imprison the true threat: the [Outsider](#entry:outlander-entry). Defeating it ultimately led to the Outsider’s release.\n\n#### Chapter 2\n\n**Origins**\nThe second chapter introduced even more Stain types and powerful boss-class Stains. Among them were four major foes, each guarding a key location:\n\n- **Stain King Elpis** – A two-headed dragon guarding [Star Site: Elpis](#entry:star-site-elpis-entry)\n- **Stain King Chronos** – A mechanical guardian defending [Star Site: Chronos](#entry:star-site-chronos-entry)\n- **Stain King Proto** – A knight-like figure, resembling the first chapter’s Stain King, guarding the [Stronghold of Ruin](#entry:stronghold-of-ruin-entry)\n- **Stain King Chaos** – A chaotic, rodent-like creature guarding [Star Site: Chaos](#entry:star-site-chaos-entry)\n\nThis chapter revealed that the real world, too, was falling victim to the spread of the Stains, through an encroaching phenomenon known as the **Ruination**. At its heart lay the _Heart of Ruin_, the ultimate source of this corruption.\n\nAs the heroes ventured deeper, they uncovered scattered stories that illuminated the history and tragedy behind the Stains:\n\n- One tale spoke of an explorer who accidentally unearthed the corruption while seeking treasure.\n- Another followed a scholar researching the Stains, who uncovered a prophecy foretelling the world’s eventual fall.\n- A third told the account of a refugee who witnessed the Ruination render lands uninhabitable and drive entire species to extinction.\n\n_Note: Further information on these stories is available in the Library Archive._\n\n**The “Cursed” Ones**\nOne particularly chilling discovery was that of the _ruin-touched_—people who had come into contact with the corruption. These individuals lost their sanity; their spirits twisted until they were driven to commit violence against those they once held dear.\n\nOn Day 7, during the final dungeon, the [Heart of Ruin](#entry:heart-of-ruin-entry), five heroes (Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori) were also cursed. Unlike the stories of old, this time it felt as though an external force, perhaps **The Curse** itself, had seized control the moment they entered the dungeon. They turned against their comrades until the others managed to purify and rescue them.\n\n[Read \"The Truth of Ruin\"](#text:the-truth-of-ruin)\n[Read \"Prelude of Ruin\"](#text:prelude-of-ruin)\n[Read \"Song of Ruin\"](#text:song-of-ruin)\n\n### Current Theories\n\nSeveral theories have been put forward regarding the Stains’ origins. One speculates that Stains were once Libestans, transformed through corruption. Another suggests a deeper [connection](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/1fbq036/enreco_theory_about_the_stains/) between the Stains and Shiori Nyavellas.\n\nAt the conclusion of the second chapter, an unexpected twist saw Mococo, Fuwawa, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori once again turning on their allies and defying Fia’s wishes. Some believe this was due to another curse after their brief encounter with The Curse. Others argue it was a conscious act—an expression of rebellion, a choice they made on their own. As stated within the story itself and by the heroes themselves: **\"Nothing stays pure.\"**",

She pulled them back through time and transported them to the Library to save their lives. It was here that they first met Fia, the current Librarian, who explained their new objective: they needed to help her recover her lost memories—fragments lost due to the effects of time travel—in order to find a way to prevent the Outsider’s existence.\n\n> _The Library Between Worlds is an archive of lore from across the multiverse.

From the outside, it took the form of a dome with open entrances on all four sides, nestled within the kingdom’s walls.\n\nAt the heart of the Library stood a small quartz podium set atop a serene pool of water—Fia’s usual place of residence.\n\nMost striking were the endless stacks of bookshelves lining the Library. True to its purpose, the Library housed [lore](https://www.youtube.com/live/5pgqtkxazUo?si=Avq9ghV6qktpwDi8&t=1123) from across the multiverse. Here, the heroes would also submit daily journal entries, as requested by Fia. Any newly discovered book or piece of lore would also be cataloged and made available for reading.\n\n### Lore and Journals\n\nLore played a crucial role in the second chapter, uncovering the kingdom’s history, the rise of the Stains, and hidden truths that shaped the world.

      "content": "## Overview\n\nThe Sanctuary remained a mystery in both meaning and purpose. It was the very first place where the heroes opened their eyes before their journeys began. It was also the site of the final battle between the heroes and the Captive in the first chapter.\n\n## Details\n\n### Appearance\n\nFloating across what seemed like the fabric of space and time itself, the Sanctuary exuded a mythical, divine aura. It consisted of several large, round, disk-shaped platforms, each illuminated sparsely in its corners by glowing blue sea lanterns. One disk stood out among the rest—at its center stood a massive, egg-like artifact, encircled by towering beacons of light shooting endlessly into the void. This entire realm was surrounded by a sea of stars, drifting within a space so vast, cold, and silent that it felt like a realm fit for gods.\n\n### Stories\n\nAs early as the heroes could remember, they awoke in this cold, mysterious place, greeted by an equally mysterious voice whispering directly into their minds. Whether these were their own thoughts or someone else’s, they couldn’t tell. The cryptic message it delivered only deepened the enigma:\n\n> Faced with oblivion, I feel. Empty?\n> Relieved?\n> Perhaps distraught?\n> I do not know.\n> So much I don't know... And yet...\n> That bright light... It calls to me...\n\nAfter that, the heroes never returned to the Sanctuary—until the final day of the first chapter.\n\nDuring the last battle, as the [Captive](#entry:outlander-entry) was defeated, the fabric of space began to unravel. In that moment, a mysterious voice—now revealed to be [Fia](#entry:iphania-entry)—urged the heroes to jump into a portal, leading them to the Library and marking the beginning of the second chapter.",
