It served not only as an archive of multiversal lore and the heroes’ memories throughout their time in Libestal, but also as the home of a significant figure: the Library’s caretaker, Fia.\n\n## Details\n\n### Preface\n\nAs the heroes faced off against the Outsider and watched the world around them crumble, Fia [intervened](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=19OQf5NWGUyY74j9&t=548). She pulled them back through time and transported them to the Library to save their lives. It was here that they first met Fia, the current Librarian, who explained their new objective: they needed to help her recover her lost memories—fragments lost due to the effects of time travel—in order to find a way to prevent the Outsider’s existence.\n\n> _The Library Between Worlds is an archive of lore from across the multiverse. It moves freely through time and space, opening its doors wherever and whenever it pleases._\n\n[Read \"The Library\"](#text:the-library)\n\n### Appearance and Role\n\nThe Library radiated a dreamy atmosphere, with a wooden interior intertwined with vines and greenery, lit warmly by lanterns and the ethereal glow of froglights. From the outside, it took the form of a dome with open entrances on all four sides, nestled within the kingdom’s walls.\n\nAt the heart of the Library stood a small quartz podium set atop a serene pool of water—Fia’s usual place of residence.\n\nMost striking were the endless stacks of bookshelves lining the Library. True to its purpose, the Library housed [lore](https://www.youtube.com/live/5pgqtkxazUo?si=Avq9ghV6qktpwDi8&t=1123) from across the multiverse. Here, the heroes would also submit daily journal entries, as requested by Fia. Any newly discovered book or piece of lore would also be cataloged and made available for reading.\n\n### Lore and Journals\n\nLore played a crucial role in the second chapter, uncovering the kingdom’s history, the rise of the Stains, and hidden truths that shaped the world. These pieces of lore were found throughout the heroes’ travels—from forgotten ruins to the depths of ancient dungeons.\n\n**General Lore**\nContained records on major figures and the overarching history of the kingdom of Libestal.\n\n[Read \"Fia\"](#text:fia)\n[Read \"Libestal Ficta\"](#text:libestal-ficta)\n[Read \"libestal\"](#text:libestal)\n[Read \"The Outsider\"](#text:the-outsider)\n\n**Book of Prophecies**\nAs described by the Princess, this book knew all and revealed all. It didn’t simply predict the future—it _defined_ it, including the doomed fate of Libestal.\n\n[Read \"Book of Prophecies 3:21\"](#text:book-of-prophecies-3-21)\n[Read \"Book of Prophecies 3:7\"](#text:book-of-prophecies-3-7)\n[Read \"Book of Prophecies 8:4\"](#text:book-of-prophecies-8-4)\n[Read \"Book of Prophecies 3:14\"](#text:book-of-prophecies-3-14)\n[Read \"Book of Prophecies 6:10\"](#text:book-of-prophecies-6-10)\n[Read \"Book of Prophecies 2:29\"](#text:book-of-prophecies-2-29)\n\n**Explorer's Journal**\nThe diary of an ancient explorer who, long before the corruption took hold, ventured into deep cliffs in search of treasure. One by one, his companions dropped out, until he finally discovered what he believed to be the treasure—only to realize they had unleashed something terrible: possibly the Stains.\n\n[Read \"Explorer's Journal #1\"](#text:explorers-journal-1)\n[Read \"Explorer's Journal #2\"](#text:explorers-journal-2)\n[Read \"Explorer's Journal #3\"](#text:explorers-journal-3)\n[Read \"Explorer's Journal #4\"](#text:explorers-journal-4)\n[Read \"Explorer's Journal #5\"](#text:explorers-journal-5)\n\n**Researcher's Journal**\nThe records of a researcher studying the spread of shadowy beings known as the Stains. Their writings chronicled a desperate attempt to uncover whether the Book of Prophecies—and the Ruination it foretold—would truly bring about the world’s end.\n\n[Read \"Researcher's Journal #1\"](#text:researchers-journal-1)\n[Read \"Researcher's Journal #2\"](#text:researchers-journal-2)\n[Read \"Researcher's Journal #3\"](#text:researchers-journal-3)\n[Read \"Researcher's Journal #4\"](#text:researchers-journal-4)\n[Read \"Researcher's Journal #5\"](#text:researchers-journal-5)\n\n**Rider's Journal**\nThe diary of a refugee and caretaker of gryphons, who witnessed firsthand the devastation wrought by the Stains—the loss of their home, and the loved ones they once protected.\n\n[Read \"Rider's Journal #1\"](#text:riders-journal-1)\n[Read \"Rider's Journal #2\"](#text:riders-journal-2)\n[Read \"Rider's Journal #3\"](#text:riders-journal-3)\n[Read \"Rider's Journal #4\"](#text:riders-journal-4)\n[Read \"Rider's Journal #5\"](#text:riders-journal-5)\n\n**Heart of Ruin**\nThis tome revealed the source of the Ruination, the calamity it unleashed, and the true nature of the corruption itself.\n\n[Read \"The Truth of Ruin\"](#text:the-truth-of-ruin)\n[Read \"Prelude of Ruin\"](#text:prelude-of-ruin)\n[Read \"Song of Ruin\"](#text:song-of-ruin)\n\n### The Heroes' Journals\n\nAt the end of each day, the heroes were asked to record their experiences and submit them to the Library. In stark contrast to the heavy and often tragic tone of the other books, their entries were… quirky, to say the least.\n\n_Note: You can read all of the heroes' entries in Chapter 2's charts._\n\n### Credits\n\n- World Builder - [tskai_xx](https://x.com/tskai_xx/status/1919396839205593174/photo/1)",
