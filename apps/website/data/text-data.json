I slept through some exciting happenings it seems, at the end of the last era. But now I gained all this knowledge with which I will try my best\n\nto spread kindness and control capitalism to my best abilities.\n\nSpeaking of kindness, I met my cousin, Cecilia Immerkind, or atleast I am\nassuming that she is my cousin because she is also trying her best to be as kind as possible. I love that for her. She seems to be familiar with my customs and therefore i thought it would be kind to assume she wanted a kiss because thats common among us cousins, but she seemed quite surprised and flustered. I am sure she had no problem with it though.\nI, by the way, became a Smith today.\nWithin these endeavors I heard, as the job market was booming, and a lot of people were starting up new jobs, that many people were starting off trying to make big coinage right away. I felt that as a kind knight, it is my duty to try to protect the common folk from capitalism, of course, and have been pushing the whole day to spread kindness. If they cant afford to do their quests, how could they become stronger and survive in this tough, forsaken world?\n\nI will continue to offer my own services either at material-only requirements or, if a poor soul really is in need, I will even do it for free. (What a deal!)\nSuch is the way of a noble knight.\n\nSpeaking of knights, I reuknighted with fellow knight Lady Bloodflame.\nAs always, she displays a level of honor that is immeasurable. We decided, as we are both smiths, to work hand in hand together and make our own headquarters.\nBefore I knew it, she had already built half of it by the end of the day without my help. Amazing, huzzah.\n\nTomorrow I will try to lend a hand, and continue to push her to reward herself with a bigger loo. Which, she sleeps in. Perhaps we can use that room as an actual loo instead.\n\nAt the end of the day I find myself 8 times stronger than I was at the start of the\n\nday, and with a 3 times strengthened Phoenix Sword, I feel ready to challenge anything that comes my way, and protect the common folk and my fellow adventurers.\n\nI am looking forward to everyone elses diary!!!!!!!!!!!!! huzzah.\ngute Nacht.",

Thank god I was chef and had cheffed up my inventory.\n\nI have learned that the jewelers plotted to swoop up everyone's fortunes with their jewel gacha system. Thankfully I have made connections that will keep my gold safe and sound.\n\nI have made 40 gold revenue through my shop. Mind you, that 40 gold was from pity from a friend. Nonetheless it was still business. But I have learned that my food has more value than just mere gold. It can be used to barter with other people in their respective professions for their services.\nWho cares about my store. I don't.\n\nI was invited by immerkind to the creek with her, a peasant, a lighter pink cat, and my brother. We drank stain souls till dawn and bonded under the influence of alcohol I was questioning immerkind's kindness with her short whispers of \"peasant\" whenever the peasant passed by, but I eventually understood it was not a big deal I witnessed her mingling with the peasant in a very suggestive manner. I wonder if I will be able to witness their date one day.\n\nWill they have offspring that would also be peasant? That is the actual question.\n\nThrough that creek gathering, I was able to bond with the light pink cat and have vowed to keep her belly bursting with food and plump. She is one lucky cat She must know that I make the finest dishes.\n\nI have killed many stains today. So many, that I now have a total of 6293 coins. My savings will all go to my lavish gift I have planned for my consort eternal I really hope she will like it.\n\nOh i see peasant has logged in bc she probably forgot to write in the diary.\n\nI have also seen my brother around. She was not handling the alcohol very well and it made me a very concerned Oniichan.\n\nI have fulfilled my oniichan duties by leaving my brother a lavish gift of about? 10 chocolate cakes. She mentioned many times yesterday how much she liked cake. I have not been told DAISUKI today, something that I am totally not salty about. Maybe its a good thing. It just means that I was not exploited today. I hope she will be elated from the gift. I told her my birthday was tomorrow. I seek a bountiful return.\n\nPeople left me one person at a time until I was eventually alone in this cruel world.\n\nIt was only then that Tammy, now nicknamed Sapphire, appeared in my empty world. I secretly call her Sapphie in my heart. She is wonderful company, and I assisted her in clearing the Elpis Dungeon. I carried hard.\n\nI would say about half of the day I was trying to hunt chickens for eggs. I eventually thought up of a plan to hatch chickens in my house. I successfully laid 2 chickens and had them locked up in my abode. When I came back with milk, they were gone. I wonder where they went. We will never know.\n\nI, as a very experienced chef, have now learned how to make some ridiculously expensive milkshakes, and chicken cutlets. Hopefully they will help me build more connections and friends along the way.\nWho cares about cash.\n\nToday, was a good day.\n\nHPO",

But I write all the same. So that they might know: I endure and I am ok.\n\nShe ventured with me. She gifted me roses today. She kissed me. She's remembering more. Nerissa Ravencroft... Is it ok giving her more newer memories when we face such challenges, am I worthy of being part of them? what if I'm only rewriting a story I was never truly in?\n\nStill, She is beautiful -... whenever I look into her eyes I feel a guilt coil like a serpant in the pit of my stomach. It is probably her charm effect she places on all knights. A spell. A curse. Or perhaps something older than memory.\n\nI fear too early, for my mind misgives; Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\nShall bitterly begin.\n\nI shall keep tight my sword, hold steady and keep my honor unbroken.\nUntil my own memory fades or destiny snuffs my flame I will go onwards and upwards.\n\nWritten by the hand of Lady Elizabeth Bloodflame.",

I almost got left alone due to being trapped but the magic scroll saved me after sending my prayers to the gods..\n\nChronos was powerful but we managed to defeat it and regain a fragment of our memory. I was surprised that I was in fact a queen of Libestal and that I was so powerful. Many peasants were jealous and in awe of the real royalty standing before them, but the feeling is understandable. I am absolutely smashing after all. I cannot believe that I had low self-confidence in myself in the past. I faced some... complications. Nothing major, just that I was framed for drowning two peasants and being accused of infidelity.\n\nBut there was no drowning in the library.\n\nGonathan seems to be in a difficult position after I advised him to pursue love and to seize the opportunity. His heart is pure but lost. I will try my best to make sure he does not go astray.\n\nI don't know how to feel about living in the same space as Nyavella and Gonathan for a year.

I was not able to obtain the hidden treasure that the dungeon holds even after 3 more attempts. Those 3 attempts were made with my light pink kitty cat, and my sapphire.\n\nI had learned that my sapphire had kept a secret relationship with my kitty cat during the dungeon runs. We were absolutely heartbroken by her but have learned to forgive her under the conditions that she serve us as a maid. She agreed to said terms and even cleaned up after my kitty cat.\n\nIt was only after my kitty cat went to bed, that the maid suddenly had a different idea of what we agreed upon.\n\nI find it concerning but I understand that she is going through a lot.\n\nShe did give me roses, ones that I gladly accepted.\n\nIt was then that I suddenly felt a pang of pain in my abdomen. My guts tell me that the sensation that I experienced, was the gift of life. The others around me kept telling me otherwise but I believe that my consort and I's love had brought forth a new life into this world.\n\nMy maid was distressed at the idea, and suddenly threatened me with violence and abusive words. The stress of having the gift of life in me, along with being slandered by someone I thought accepted me for who I was (who btw was also keeping a hidden relationship, and in my defense, my consort and I's relationship was very much public information.) made me have thoughts of not continuing my life any longer.\n\nI was so cornered, I found myself at the edge of a cliff. My guard dog, Gonathan, Tammy aka my sapphire, and my brother all tried to stop me. But I couldn't contain my sadness and I flew for 5 seconds until I suddenly awoke again in a new life. I learned that the others followed suit and it was then that I learned that I had so many people who cared for me.\n\nThe only concerning thing is that right after my new life started, I didn't feel the pangs of pain in my abdomen that I felt before. My gift of life... I can't bear at the thought of the possibility of losing the precious gift between me and my consort. Thankfully, after having a meal, the gift had returned once again as pains in my abdomen.\n\nMy brother and her beloved are helping me plan a gender reveal party for my consort. I am so excited to surprise her with the multiple gifts I prepared, along with the special news.\n\nI can't wait to greet this new life to this world.",

I wanted to purchase charms at Gacharm but the prices increased from 200 to 400. I could not afford it-I mean, I could but I had to leave some for future purchases. And so, using my memory, I told Pandora that we were betrothed to one another in the past world. Pandora, touched, gave me a legendary charm.\n\nI felt terrible as I was already in love with another woman, who already had a consort. I spent the rest of the night mulling over the events and regretting my actions.\nThe next day, I went on to clear the dungeon once again with HPO and Pandora, which was a nervewracking situation after recent events, but I hoped that nothing would go wrong.\n\nI was wrong...\n\nPandora began to unravel the events that happened at Gacharm and my reputation and respect went down understandably so. In order to repent, I had to beg for forgiveness and their deal was that I was to become their maid and be at their beck and call. I felt humiliated when I had to say, \"My beloved masters, your lovely maid is here.\"\n\nI am a queen and to be ashamed by the one I thought was the love of my life is breaking me.\n\nAfter the third attempt, we still did not receive the gift of the dungeon but at least my suffering was over. I called Gonathan to see how he was doing and my voice unfortunately cracked, which he could tell. We went to our usual meeting spot and there I confessed to everything that had transpired.\n\nEverything was a blur but when I went to the library to write today's entry, HPO was there and she decided to use today's deal to make me say the phrase and today's events to Nyavella and Koseki Bijou. I had to tell Gonathan to look away as I began to display such pitiful behaviour. I hope that he didn't see it.\n\nAfterwards, HPO confessed that she might have a child and we were all shocked. I decided to look for Gonathan but HPO decided to come after me to once again repeat that she was pregnant with the consort. I was hurt, furious, and confused. She was hurt by my words and ran off. She threatened to throw herself off the cliff and called her brother, Koseki Bijou. Then, the three threw themselves off the cliff towards their death. I attempted to do the same but I survived the fall.\n\nAfterwards, HPO's pregnancy turned out to be mere constipation from overconsumption.\n\nThings are still not resolved completely but I believe that with the bouquet I gifted HPO, maybe things will be better now...\n\nBeing queen is suffering.",

We showed Lady Bloodflame the Knights Suite, which was... more unassuming than I was expecting. Perhaps Mordan Ramsey should work on making their rooms more... adequate. We enjoyed jumping on the bed, however. I also had a duel with Lady Bloodflame, 3 to be exact.\n\nShe beat me twice, but I won the final duel, winning a prize: a gorgeous ring. Quite lovely, quite happy to have it. Yes. We also discovered a strange temple of sorts, hiding under my storefront. Odd, I don't remember building such a thing? In it are my painting, and several of my poetry books, I do not know how or why they are there, but now I feel a strong urge to leave them as they are.\n\nSo many strange occurances - I also recieved a memory from Shiori of the Novella. It's very strange, and that's all i will say. I also found 5 of 7 children playing hide-and-seek, I wonder where the rest could be?\nToday was quite tiring, but I'm looking forward to the end of the world\n\nSincerely,\nNerissa",

Rather than Krabby x Plinkton it became Krabby x Money.\n\nThe green thing was set aside for an even greener thing—cash. Cold, hard cash. Something that hardens Krabby even more than Plinkton\n\nAnd so, this is a tale to warn you all.\n\nDon't get greedy. Or else you suck.",
