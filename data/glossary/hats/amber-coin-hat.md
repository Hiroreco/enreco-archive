[name]:    Amber Coin Hat

### <u>Description</u> 
A first glance at the Amber Coin's hat and you could immediately tell it’s something a merchant would wear. It reeks of money—the giant jewel attached to the front screams monetary value. All of that is fitting for a guild that’s, well, known for gambling.

### <u>Story</u> 
Not much really went on with this hat, considering there were only two active Amber Coin members, one of whom defected. The most notable moment was when it was used as a prize for said defector.
