### <u>Description</u> 
**Gremlin Grenade**, a pair of spiked metal gauntlets—so massive they nearly dwarf their wielder's head—are the weapons worn by our humble knight, Gonathon G, upon his arrival in the Kingdom of Libestal.

### <u>Ability and Story</u> 
Once a mischievous orange gremlin chasing justice in their own chaotic way, these gauntlets were the tools Gonathon used to hunt down criminals and "fist" them into submission—before he eventually *de-gremlinfied* and rose to become the noble knight we all know and love.

When activated, the gauntlets launch Gonathon forward, allowing him to perform AoE ground pounds that erupt with follow-up explosions, dealing serious damage to anyone unlucky enough to be nearby. Much like Raora’s launch ability, it also lets Gonathon reach places most others can’t… which, yes, he totally abused to cheese his way to a [dungeon treasure](https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared&t=6730).
