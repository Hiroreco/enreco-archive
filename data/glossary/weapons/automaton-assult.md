### <u>Description</u> 
**Automaton Assult**, a lance adorned in gold and green, is the beloved weapon of Cecilia Immergreen on her journey through the Kingdom of Libestal.

### <u>Ability and Story</u> 
An ancient automaton, a champion of Justice with a love for flowers, tea, and assulting the world with her *very unbiased* opinions, it’s only fitting her weapon carries a name like this.

When activated, Cecilia unleashes a concentrated flurry of spear strikes at her enemies. As terrifying as being on the receiving end of a rapid-fire poking spree sounds, the intimidation factor tends to wear off just a bit—thanks to the adorably cheerful catchphrase she never forgets to shout right before launching her target into oblivion.
