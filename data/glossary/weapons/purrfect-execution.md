### <u>Description</u> 
**Purrfect Execution**, a playful yet unmistakably intimidating name, is the title of the razor-sharp mechanical claw wielded by Raora Panthera on her journey through Libestal.

### <u>Ability and Story</u> 
Raora is a panther — a *pink* one at that. Fierce, relentless, and full of sass. She runs on coffee, harbors a deep disdain for tea, and was once a proud agent of Justice... until her memories were lost and she entered a chaotic rivalry with Tam, boldly crowning herself “Queen Mario.”

Despite all that, her claw still reflects the prowess of a deadly feline. When activated, Raora is launched into the air, executing rapid claw strikes while orbiting around her target — slashing through multiple enemies like a cat expertly pouncing on its prey.
