### <u>Description</u> 
**Rest In Peace** — a name as fitting as it is ominous for a scythe. This isn't the kind you'd find in a farmer's shed; its design is dark and foreboding, with a jagged handle and a protruding joint that amplifies the menace of its razor-sharp blade. This was the weapon wielded by Mori Calliope on her journey through Libestal.

### <u>Ability and Story</u> 
The Grim Reaper herself — the literal embodiment of Death — naturally carries a scythe of such sinister stature (though her career pivot into a tavern owner offering divorce services and getting herself knocked out by a truck somewhat tarnish that terrifying image).

As for its ability, it's as straightforward as Calli herself. No magic. No flashy tricks. Just a single, powerful, lateral swing — cleaving through her target.
