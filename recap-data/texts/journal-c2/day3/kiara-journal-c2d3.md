Liebes Tagebuch

Today was a great day! I slayed many monsters, and was able to live up to my promise of helping, or actually even finishing the forge that me and Lady Bloodflame own.
I am not the most passionate builder, but it turned out great!

Speaking of Lady Bloodflame, as I felt like I owed her for how I temporarily monopolized the smithing market, I offered her my assistance in various ways and have since been pouring sugar over her like a good mother would. She was first confused, but she seems to have accepted my good will by now.

With my cousin I have also managed to reach a new level in our relation. Perhaps the connection of blood shall not be in the way of our blooming love.

Speaking of blooming love, inspired by my own luck in this department, I am trying to help out Gonathan. Gon seems to be a bit confused about their hearts desires, and I think I have just the right person to introduce.
I shall set up a blind date!!!! HUZZAH. Love is in the air.
