<!-- title: Tam's Journal Entry: Day 3 -->

**Day 3**

I went on a quest with Pandora and Nerissa and defeated the evil. I was caught off guard when there were (unconfirmed) claims as to how the princess and the outlander are siblings and not lovers. It left a foul taste in my mouth when I found out. Afterwards, I joined a pack from Gonathan at his suggestion. The requirement is to howl, which was strange. There also seems to be a strange cult going around worshipping sandwich and they were trying to recruit me under the name "blueberry".
Strange things...

There are also some hauntings where I have witnessed a cape ghost, one instance where it talked with a low voice and the other kept swearing nonstop. Pinky-I mean Hot Pink One gave me a mysterious potion and advised me to use it only when necessary.

I don't really understand what's happening but I hope tomorrow will be as eventful as today.
