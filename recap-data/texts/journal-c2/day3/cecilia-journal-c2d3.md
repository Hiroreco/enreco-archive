**Kindness II**

Dearest diary

Today I realised that my greed and indecisiveness costs you more than you might think.

By trying to please everyone you end up pleasing no one.

And even though as kind as I am, and as warmly filled my heart may be. I cannot accept these thoughts about the princess.

If they so are truly real. I shall wait another day as she has bid me.

Before I make any rash decisions. She is my light and she is a flower.
But maybe she is supposed to bloom with another.

The kind people around me have helped me overcome my emotions for now and we will see what our next days together bring us.

I feel safe around my fellow wolves.

Awooooooooooooooo

May kindness touch you heart.
