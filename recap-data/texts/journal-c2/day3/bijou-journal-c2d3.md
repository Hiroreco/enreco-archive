**JOURNAL DAY 3**

The Journal
of \[Former\] Princess
Koseki Bijou

Today...was filled with plentiful events!!

GaCharm officially opened it's business doors and we have made much profit! All of libestal has now tasted the joys of gacha!! And you know...once you have had a taste of something...it may leave you wanting more...

I spent a lot of time with my fellow adventurers today! Together, we discovered secrets, traversed dangerous halls, and fought through many stain enemies.

I met the outsider today too. It seems he and the princess may have a connection...perhaps lovers?

BUT a dangerous rumour has also spread about them. That...the two are RELATED. In fact, perhaps not just all of the citizens of this past libestal are related...but WE...the shining stars...perhaps...all have the same face.
Does this make us... INBREAD?
Yes...it is clear now...
We are inbread. It is our duty to make sure that EVERYONE realizes this fact in the hopes that we can come together to form
...the giant sandwich

My breadtheren and I, will work hard to realize this goal together from here on. So that the rest of the non breadlievers can see the light of the sandwich. We will collect all of the ingredients...soon.

There are many interesting characters in this world. It brings me great joy to act as a small pebble on the road, silently observing the goings on of the kingdom. After all, with knoweldge comes great power. And I have come to learn a great deal today.

Knowledge such as rumours of a ghost that haunts the kingdom! Libestal may need saving in more ways than one...A ghost that spits out the most vulgar of vocabulary is something my pure, innocent, ears cannot stand for. Injustice I say!!!

Well... We will have to see what tomorrow brings...
