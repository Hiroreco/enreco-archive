<!-- title: Shiori's Journal Entry: Day 3 -->

**Day 3**

Character studied today: Gonathon.

Areas Explored: The violent 3rd one.
Did not make as much progress studying the others as much as I'd like. Spent most of the time with...

...the guileless knight.

He offered to buy my first novella - even pricing it at an extraordinary price beyond my expectations.

I did not accept all of it. Too much. Too kind.

Unsure how long such kindness will last.
We traded stories and words. Not like I liked the gifts or anything.
Just because they're framed in my home now doesn't mean I like Gonathon or anything.
Pffft. Whatever. Baka.

Will keep monitoring.
Because it's my job.
To watch. To archive. Not because I enjoy monitoring him.
