<!-- title: Gonathon's Journal Entry: Day 3 -->

**DAY THREE**

I was in the forests for the entirety of day two and was afraid I would have missed out on all of the events happening in the kingdom, but returning to Libestal was simply returning home.

After my conflicting feelings I was left with on the first day, I was almost afraid to return.

But I'm happy I did, there were many things that happened today, from dogs to wolves, to princesses, to Shiori.

She has taught me a lot about kindness! Always so humble in her words, for someone called a "humble knight", I am not as humble as her.

I hope in our remaining days that I can continue to learn from her, and even without a roof, share the same sky as her.

Although there is still much that I do not remember, rather than hopeless there is hope.

There are my wolves, there is my pack.

There is the goddess, and her teachings.

And then there is Shiori, and her potato salad.

So even if my memory returns to me, I know that I will be able to face it.

Stay hopeful Gonathon!

There are still four days left!
