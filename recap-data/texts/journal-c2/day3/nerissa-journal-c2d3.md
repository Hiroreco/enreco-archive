<!-- title: Nerissa's Journal Entry: Day 3 -->

**Day 3 Journal**

Dear Lorekeeper, Today, there was a dungeon. Though I did not recover the memory of any of the fellow heroes of Libestal, I did still manage to recover some memories of my past... Again, these memories were painful. Ain't nobody want me ;( But still, I persevere. I made money today, infact, I hit 6969 coins, and then I went beyond. So I guess, even if my past was bleak, the future need not be so. I also reconnected to my gambling addiction. I get it now, why I loved it so much. The thrill of going all in on red, and winning it all. Even if the chances are small, I'll do anything for that feeling... afterall, in this world where I am neither hero, nor witch, nor successful chef I must hold onto what semblence of emotion I can, before it escapes me.

Sincerely,
Nerissa (Juliet Bloodflame) Ravencroft
