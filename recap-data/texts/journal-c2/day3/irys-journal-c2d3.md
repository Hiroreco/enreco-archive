<!-- title: Hot Pink One's Journal Entry: Day 3 -->

HPO's Daily Diary
Day 3

Today was a great day.

I conquered the ruins and met the outlander. Apparently, this outlander is related to the princess and I find that fact very intriguing.

I have also received the secret disk that plays the most beautiful voice in the land.

Now onto the juicy stuff.

We have learned the truth about all the people of Libestal, including all of us heroes are in-bread.
More people need to accept this truth. Therefore, me, my brother, the pink cat, and the peasant have formed a sandwich. A sandwich that still lacks ingredients, but as more people's eyes open to the truth, they will learn to be a part of the sandwich. Their DESTINY. We are the In-Breadtheren

Speaking of my pink cat, she suggested that my bonds with her were closer than I thought. I fed her well, along with my brother. It was a good feeding session. I just pray that my brother will not partake in any other feeding session unless I am involved.

I need to keep my brother safe.

My brother also celebrated my birthday with a very lovely gift of surprise, song, and dance. A bonus charm as well. It was the best gift I could've ever asked for. Oh how blessed I am to have such an endearing brother.

I have also heard that there is an invisible cape that haunts libestal. There have been sightings of a deep voiced cape, a cape that may have vocal tendencies similar to me, and a cape that spouted the most vulgar words ever to be heard.

It is terrifying even to think of such a thing existing. We must do our best as heroes to purify these lands and rid of it from these flying capes.

That is my mission, and my goal.
