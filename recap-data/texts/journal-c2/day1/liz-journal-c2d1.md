<!-- title: Elizabeth's Journal Entry: Day 1 -->

**Knights Log 0001**

My name is Elizabeth Bloodflame. A Jade Sword Knight. Trained by Viridis. I know it's odd to write the above but I do not wish to keep on forgetting or at least I feel this is best.
We are in new lands. New past lands. A strange journey through time.

It seems we need to prepare again, ordered by a King and now by a Princess. I've noticed - some hearts have forgotten bonds, even small. Seeing loyalty disappear in front of my eyes is strange, literally swallowed by time.

What is Fia?...
Why have most forgotten?...

My little sister Mococo has forgotten. Part of myself feels it's a good thing as it means she has forgotten any hurt - but also I feel greedy in ways still wanting to be her sister.

I was quick to remind her of what we were what is but her eyes did not know mine. I guess some threads are too sacred to leave frayed.

In the previous land we ventured I was called Romeo. I dismissed it - believing the weight of duty left no room for such nicknames.
Now I wonder. Perhaps some moments are stolen so suddenly like sword strokes I begin to understand it was something to cherish even a little. I guess I've learnt to appreciate the little things as sometimes they can vanish.

---

My comrades - I will call them that even if they are lost remain by my side. I'm happy at least The Mighty Phoenix remembers, I feel there is a warmth shared. The "Shining Stars" is what we were reffered to as. Must mean something. I'm guessing the shine is our revalation??? I hope throughout this journey I learn truly what they mean by Shining Stars.

Until more answers come, I have Thorn by my side and my vow as a Knight.

For memories untold.

For what was forgotten.

For HONOR!

Written by the hand of Lady Elizabeth Bloodflame.
