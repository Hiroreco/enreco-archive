<!-- title: Gonathon's Journal Entry: Day 1 -->

**DAY ONE**

Day one of being in this new strange kingdom.

Everything feels familiar, the walls, the ground, the air, the people.

Everyone that's arrived here with me feel familiar too.

Some of them seem to remember me, they talk of me being a knight.

But there are some that feel so close to me, that do not remember me at all.

I wonder if this means anything.

I barely remember anything as well.

Others say I was kind, but was I really?

Was I a humble knight?

Someone that good wouldn't have forgotten their most cherished memories, would they?

I'm hoping by the end of this that I'll be able to remember.

Mordan(?) Ramsay (I am not quite sure what the spelling is on their name), the hero of Libestal who has retained all their memories!

Says that we're fighting for our memories! That we're in search for them!

So surely... if I keep fighting, I'll find what's missing.

Gonathon G.
