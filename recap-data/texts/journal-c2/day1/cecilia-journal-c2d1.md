Kindness I

Diary of Immerkind.

Today I was blessed with kindness. I feel kindness in my heart and surrounding me.

I want to spread kindness. And seperate couples! For kindness!

I also met a kind cousin who made me feel even kinder and many other kind souls.
Such as my HPO Oliver and my princesses.

However I do not trust the peasant... but my kind heart tries to look past our differences. For now.

May kindness touch all our hearts.
