**JOURNAL DAY 1**

The Journal
of \[Former\] Princess
Koseki Bijou

This world...it already has a princess... Do I...even have a purpose?

I mean, we came here to save the world so I suppose titles and formalities will have to wait. For now... I have to get a job. The stones call to me. Something from the inside, maybe from the jewel that is embedded in my chest resonates with the surrounding stone.

I have chosen to call myself a jeweler, working under the tutelege of Roa... my new boss. She is very kind and teaches me many things of this profession.

I would like to make her proud so I started building a place to call our own, the.. "Gacharm" shop.
Together with Mococo and my sister, I hope our business thrives in this world!

I have met many interesting characters today, some, including my boss, don't seem to remember their pasts.

While I...I am burdened with my memories of my past trials. I hope that this time, I can right my wrongs and save this world...instead of dooming it...

Oh! And I made many friends today! Including a blood pact with my former SC...

I must call her onii-chan now...but I think if I do she likes it and is more inclined to give me things. Well whatever, I enjoy her company :D

I don't know what tomorrow brings, but I have hope in my heart, that in 7 days time, those of us who came from another world can truly save this one if we join together, We have to.

Well, let's see what tomorrow brings.
