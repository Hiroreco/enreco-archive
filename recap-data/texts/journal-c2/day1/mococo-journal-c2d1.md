**MOCOCO Day 1**

day 1:
i've started out a new business venture with roa and koseki bijou! we're partners together for our new jewelry company but we've had a few hiccups along the way... bijou's sister inya is sabotaging the market value of our crafts! hopefully we can get her to see eye to eye on this issue and join us in business...
i'm slowly and surely getting to be a better jeweler, but it's all to be close to beautiful, luxurious riches!! i'll get my paws on them!

THEM I'LL GET MY PAWS ON THEM!!

also I met my sister

Elizabeth!! It was a strange meeting, but I'm happy to get to spend more time together from here on out.
BAU BAU.
