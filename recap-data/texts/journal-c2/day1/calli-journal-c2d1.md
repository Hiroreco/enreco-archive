Day 00001

Dear Luffy,

Today was the beginning of a most curious journey. As an ex-tavern master, I worked hard in order to fulfill my dream as a chef...by being first, an architect! So, my tavern is nearly complete. 
There was a bit of questing to be done as well, and I ended up fulfilling all of my obligations to the quest board, and the quest master, who does nothing but spit bars....
Gonathan is my dog. I made some other dogs, too! Dogs for life! Orange women are very beautiful. That Shiori set up a store next time mine which was all fun at the start until she started monopolizing my business!! She only serves cakes though, so it's not a worry. It's just...since it is MY establishment, I figure, shouldn't she pay rent? She's also selling OTHER FOOD as of right now...

So I booted her shop until the 500 coin rental fee is paid. Or, she can build her own!! >:{

Then that HOT PINK ONE had the gall to put her shop in front of my stairs?! I was appalled! I tried to charge her rent, but she just moved away. Phew!

It's okay. I forgive her.

She and I...share a special secret, after all...
