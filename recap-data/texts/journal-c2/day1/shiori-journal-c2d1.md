**Day 1**

## There's no need to pretend, is there?

A few seem to remember.

Maybe in fragments.

Some do not.

I checked the backlog. Saw nothing too consequential.

I considered feeding them 'it'. Decided against doing so.

Never know when it'll fade away anyway.

Will just watch and observe. Claimed the low stakes job for this purpose so no one expects much from me.

The story seems to have barriers in place.

Breaking it might break the script I suppose.

I better be good.

I grew curious and tested the 'death' mechanic in this world.
Didn't stay dead.

I see you.
