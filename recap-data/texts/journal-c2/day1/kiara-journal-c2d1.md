**Tales of Kind**

Liebes Tagebuch

Starting from today, my life is filled with double the amount of purpose. I slept through some exciting happenings it seems, at the end of the last era. But now I gained all this knowledge with which I will try my best

to spread kindness and control capitalism to my best abilities.

Speaking of kindness, I met my cousin, Cecilia Immerkind, or atleast I am
assuming that she is my cousin because she is also trying her best to be as kind as possible. I love that for her. She seems to be familiar with my customs and therefore i thought it would be kind to assume she wanted a kiss because thats common among us cousins, but she seemed quite surprised and flustered. I am sure she had no problem with it though.
I, by the way, became a Smith today.
Within these endeavors I heard, as the job market was booming, and a lot of people were starting up new jobs, that many people were starting off trying to make big coinage right away. I felt that as a kind knight, it is my duty to try to protect the common folk from capitalism, of course, and have been pushing the whole day to spread kindness. If they cant afford to do their quests, how could they become stronger and survive in this tough, forsaken world?

I will continue to offer my own services either at material-only requirements or, if a poor soul really is in need, I will even do it for free. (What a deal!)
Such is the way of a noble knight.

Speaking of knights, I reuknighted with fellow knight Lady Bloodflame.
As always, she displays a level of honor that is immeasurable. We decided, as we are both smiths, to work hand in hand together and make our own headquarters.
Before I knew it, she had already built half of it by the end of the day without my help. Amazing, huzzah.

Tomorrow I will try to lend a hand, and continue to push her to reward herself with a bigger loo. Which, she sleeps in. Perhaps we can use that room as an actual loo instead.

At the end of the day I find myself 8 times stronger than I was at the start of the

day, and with a 3 times strengthened Phoenix Sword, I feel ready to challenge anything that comes my way, and protect the common folk and my fellow adventurers.

I am looking forward to everyone elses diary!!!!!!!!!!!!! huzzah.
gute Nacht.
