<!-- title: Tam's Journal Entry: Day 1 -->

**Day 1**

I woke up from a long dream, which I can't seem to recall. I don't remember my name or the past but the people have been addressing me as Tam Gandr, so I assume it is that. I was also apparently a queen, which doesn't make sense because what kind of queen has to struggle with poverty... I wish to live my life in peace and accept myself for who I am. Maybe one day, I'll learn to be confident, beautiful, humble, and wealthy. The last part is most important. I am building my shop and home! I'm very excited. Small beginnings, big future.
