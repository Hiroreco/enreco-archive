Day 1 Journal

Dear Lorekeeper,

Today, I decided to become a chef. To be honest, I'm not sure I'll be any good at saving Libestal, but at the very least I *know* I can make people happy with my cooking. I am not hero, only a little chef with a dream. So please stop by and try so of "

my food for yourself. Located in the back of the build area (follow the glowstone road) and head on over to Nibs n' Nobs, where you can have your fill :)

Sincerely, Nerissa Juliet Bloodflame
