HPO's Daily Diary
Day 1
I had a good day.

I did my daily quests.
I became chef.

I saved the utters from exploding

I am lowering prices of cake for the people of Libestal

I built house with shop. The house looks like the most charming person in the land.

My consort eternal is the cutest as she has always been. I am planning on buying her something really nice on her assumed birthday that she has not told me about.

She will be the happiest consort in the land. Hopefully if she ever finds out about my secret hobby, she'll forgive me. She will always be my first priority.

I have a little brother that calls me onii-chan and thinks that a single "daisuki" will make me do all of his bidding. Foolish I say.

I say. But I do like being called oniichan. There's something about it that I can't put my finger on, but it sounds nice.

Immerkind said my name used to be Oliver before I lost my memory, but I really don't recall nany of that.

The peasant has a distinctive acquired scent that I have not acquired yet.

Tammy is my secret hobby. She calls me Pinky Pie (Might be pinkie spell wise idk) and Idk if there is a deep meaning to that nickname.
