<!-- title: Fuwawa Abyssgaurd's Journal Entry: Day 1 -->

-01-

Everything feels so fuzzy... and nostalgic...

Libestal.. Revelations... Stains... I vaguely remember what happened... The Stain King then, now The Outsider... I don't know if someone like me can live up to the title of "Shining Star"... I'm on an adventure now... Adventures are best enjoyed with close friends... Atleast, that's how it always is in the storybooks I admired as a puppy. Yet.. I'm always alone.

No one beside me... I feel empty. Like something is missing, but I don't quite know what it is.
I know I'm still just a puppy, that I'm not the strongest and have my own faults, but I hope that I can grow to be the type of demon dog that others witll want to join together with for grand times. Maybe becoming a top class chef... can change that tinge inside me. A table overflowing with recipes cooked by own hands... Friends, laughing and smiling with full tummies... That is my dream!! And maybe that day will come as we search for The Outsider and unravel all the mysteries... I'm going to stay positive no matter what!! bau bau...
