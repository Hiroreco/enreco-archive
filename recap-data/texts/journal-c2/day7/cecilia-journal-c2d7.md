<!-- title: Immerkind's Journal Entry: Day 7 -->

**Kindness VI**

Dearest Diary,

we finally saved the kingdom. My heart is full with the smiles and happiness the people of Libestal have shown us.

And most importantly seeing the weight of so much tragedy fall off my princesses shoulders truly filled me with strength

Strength to keep going and pride in what we did.

I have come to a decision.

I will be staying in this Libestal with the princess.
I will protect her smile and her heart forever.

No matter what her feeligns shall be I shall stay by her side as a royal protector.

And I will wait and wait until I meet my wolf pack, my little princess and all my friends again.

During their absence I shall be kind and show kindness to myself.

Be Immerkind.

With kindness,
Cecilia Wolf Royal Protector Immerkind.
