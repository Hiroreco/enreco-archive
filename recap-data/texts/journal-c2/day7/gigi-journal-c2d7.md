<!-- title: Gonathon's Journal Entry: Day 7 -->

**DAY SEVEN**

We've saved the kingdom of the past!

Tomorrow they are holding a grand banquet for us, a celebration of our victory.

The kingdom no longer has anything to worry about, Immerkind is planning on staying behind, and I know she will take good care of the kingdom in our absence.

Although it will be but a moment for the rest of us when we meet Immerkind again, I do worry, but I trust her, for she is pack.

It seems many things have been resolved(?) They feel as if they were, some are still lost in their emotions, but aren't we all?

It's not something that we can solve in a mere night, but rather through the journeys that we take.

Shiori of the Nyavellas has chosen to forget the memory containing me.

It is painful to know how much the memories of me must have burdened her so, but it is for the best.

I know we will continue to talk, just like how the sun will always rise.

I think after all of this, whatever happens, I will go on an adventure!

I am sure the queen will allow it, for I am always but a telepathic phonecall away if she were ever in need of me.

There are many things that I still do not know about myself, but I cannot rush it.

I cannot force myself into things that I am not ready for.

I cannot allow others to make those difficult decisions for me.

I must make them all on my own.

GONATHON G.
