**mord's finalog**

Dear Luffy,

As a chef of many hats, I've found myself jumping from job to job in order to help the good people of Libestal, but it seems that I sometimes cause hinderances...

At first, I told myself that emotions are hinderances, but maybe it isn't emotions, it's people.

That's why I was thinking of becoming a movie director. I thought, what if I were to tell the tale of this kingdom?

Of my wolf pack. Of the queen and the betrayal of the hot pink one. Of the gem princess and of the birth we witnessed today. Of true love between orange and pink women.

Of a green knight's love for the true princess of the land. Of a dense knight and a dark witch. Of a writer who is also a witch but also just screwing around (her own words).

Of a peasant turned money hungry...uh... rich person.

Of a chef doing her best, and a therapist who would never let money keep her from her clients.

Am I forgetting someone? Oh yes. A chef therapist realtor movie director who effectively saved the kingdom in the end. How?

Perhaps it has yet to be discovered! Or perhaps the answer was always there?

The one thing I've learned through all those I've met in these tainted lands is this-

The monster is in YOU.

Do you want to live empty life?

Me neither. So I'll fill it with these interesting people, regardless of how flawed I am, and see where we go from here. If we're together, I'm sure life will always be interesting.

-Mordan Ramsay
