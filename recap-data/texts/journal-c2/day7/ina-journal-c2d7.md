**Day 7**

Day 7 of Ninolna the HERO

MEOWMEOW

At last we have defeated...the great evil...I think their name was THE CURSE...

MEOWMEOW

However...more challenges were left...

MEOWMEOW

It seems like my consort...had a baby....gas?...girl?...I'm not sure...

Is it even mine? I always thought I would be able to accept however many SCs she wanted...but...now that we are thinking about becoming a family...

MEOWMEOW

I'm not sure how I feel about...how she looks at the others...

MEOWMEOW

Maybe I'm just...not confident...I don't know how I feel...

MEOWMEOW

I think I need some time to digest everything and sort out my feelings...

MEOWMEOW

My heart skipped a beat when the queen noticed me...but I do not want to betray my feelings...

MEOWMEOW

What will tomorrow hold...I'm not sure...
