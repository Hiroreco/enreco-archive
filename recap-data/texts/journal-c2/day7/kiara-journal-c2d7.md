**Tales of Love**

Liebes Tagebuch!!

We did it! We have conquered the evil curses and liberated Libestal once and for all.

But something...someone sparked more than that even. The beautiful pink cat, Pandora Roa, has infact expressed interest in me since day 1.

But we got caught up in so many weird happening since then until now, so many ups and downs for me that I completely gave up - but my search for love has finally ended.
I am the luckiest catlady alive.
Huzzah.
