<!-- title: Hot Pink One's Journal Entry: Day 7 -->

**HPO's Daily Diary**

After a long slumber to prepare to give birth to a miracle, I have awoken.

The pains continued. Thankfully I had so many loved ones care for me through these tough times.

My brother and friends prepared a gender reveal party. At this party I wanted to invite my sapphire. She arrived at the worst time.

I wanted to reveal my bonds with my sapphire to my cnosort, but the queen only wanted to destroy my special day.

She hurt my consort. I will never forgive her for that. But at the same time, I cannot forgive myself. For it was my existence that plunged the queen into madness. I didn't think it would have come to that. I really have to fix my one flaw, my density. I could have avoided this, but the queen's madness was rampaging out of control. The queen is now out to steal my consort away from me. My consort is now wavering. It is a mistake to waver when the answer is with her as she holds Gasolina in her arms.

Yes, Gasolina has arrived into this world. My brother took the honor of retrieving her from my abdomen.

We were about to find a 7LDK house for the 3 of us. Until madness took over the queen.

My one true mistake was hurting my consort. I have learned never tohurt her ever again. I will also protect her from everything that could present danger to her.

If my consort does become fooled by the queen's falsehood, I am ready to do what must be done. I will surely lead her to the truth. That only my love will be true.

Only my lovve can bestow upon her,

True Happiness.

Her happiness can only be with me and Gasolina.

Ore no Ina.

Tomorrow will be a new day. I await my consort's answer and will do whatever it takes to lead her to the right path.

If she does come to the right path on her own, then I won't have to resort to desperate measures.....
Let us pray it doesn't come to that.......
