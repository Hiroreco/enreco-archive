<!-- title: Fuwawa's Journal Entry: Day 7 -->

**-07-**

Today was a very special day...!!

I was able to do it.
A full party of smiles, laughter, and tummies full of my cooking!! I got so many complements... I felt... like this is what I was always meant to do...

It was a challenge. Making many cakes...

Full meals, even gathering drinks and thinking about how my guests might want to enjoy the dishes I prepared...

I think I can confidentally say that I am a chef! I may not be super fancy, have a farm, be part of a guild, or have a hat, but with my two paws...

I think I can say, I am a chef!! I have something to be confident about..

And maybe, I'm not so alone anymore! I have those around who come to me asking to eat my cooking... I'm very very fortunate.

I don't know how many days, weeks, years, that I'll be so fortunate, but I know that everything will be okay. Somehow, deep down.

Maybe now, with the ruination gone, I can enjoy life like this...

However, the words that were repeated today "Nothing stays pure" still rings within me... What did that mean... What is pure? What is... stained...

Maybe it's not something that a demon dog like me needs to worry about.

Back to my cooking pot and recipe book! I have smiles to feed!

BAU BAU!!
