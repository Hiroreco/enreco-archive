<!-- title: Shiori's Journal Entry: Day 7 -->

**?????**

Day ?????

What determines someone's worth?

Is it their words? Their actions?

What makes someone 'kind'? Is it based on a balance scale of how many right and wrongs they've done?

I am a witch.
A witch of memories. A witch after the truth.

Not everyone is ready to accept the truth.

Sometimes people cannot face what is in the mirror before them.

I don't think myself evil.

I don't think myself good.

I'm simply a witch following a narrative, and pushing its boundaries whenever I can.

I'll nudge them all.

With, or without memories, for someone has to play...

....a role in such things.

And if you wish to call me a Monster, then so be it.

I will take the title and lead you all.
