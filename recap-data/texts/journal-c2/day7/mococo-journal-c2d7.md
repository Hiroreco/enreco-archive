**MOCOCO Day 7**

we did it!! we saved libestal from the ruination in time!!

but i'm still worried... why was i feel so strange and sick? like i wanted to stay away from everything...
from everyone.

even though i'm feeling better now i feel like the effects are still somewhat there they linger...

and when fighting against the heart of ruin, something weird happened where suddenly i was in a different place than i was before.
i don't really know what happened... i just feel like it's been a strange few days. i feel everything but also nothing. and even though things should be better...
they still feel off.

what is the point of all of this anyways?
riches?
gems?
love?
passion?

it all seems somewhat frivolous.
does this lead to happiness?
will we forget this time in our lives one day?
is libestal truly saved, or did we just delay the people's suffering?

i guess we'll never know.

the party tonight was good though.
the food was yummy!!

bau bau.
