<!-- Nerissa's Journal Entry: Day 7 -->

**Day 7 Journal**

Dear Lorekeeper,

Today, we have destroyed the source of the ruination. Me, Shiori of the Novella, Mococo, Fuwawa, and Princess Koseki Bijou were turned in the dungeon, made to fight our friends. However, was this as much of a curse as they believed it to be?

Or was it perhaps the reality. You see, my heart is still dyed black. I have no intention of "saving" anything. All that's left is the cold, dark abyss in my heart. Empty as a void.

But it matters not, now that I have accepted myself, as I truly am. Nothing else matters, nothing but the end of the world. I will commit myself to my coven, and we shall bring about the calamity - for _nothing_ stays pure.

Sincerely,
Nerissa
