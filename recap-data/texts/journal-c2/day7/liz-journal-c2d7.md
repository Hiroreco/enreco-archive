<!-- title: Elizabeth's Journal Entry: Day 7 -->

**Knights log 00006**

I am Elizabeth Bloodflame, Jade Sword Knight, trained by Veridis, knight of honor and smith of the Jade Forge.

Today, I acted on what I last wrote, to walk the path of a better night. Not just in name but in spirit. There were moments that might, have drawn out my stubbornness, as they often do. But I chose stillness. I breathed, and strangely. I strangely felt more like myself than I have in a long while. Looking at the positives, lighter even, as though something heavy had loosened its grip.

We faced a mighty foe today. A creature born of curse and shadow. It turned our friends against us, cruelly twisting their will. Even my little sister Mococo and the beautiful Nerissa. I will not lie, I was afraid. But not for myself. Never. Never for myself. It was for them. A knight must be prepared to endure pain. But I cannot bear the thought of the people I care for falling into darkness. Not while I still draw breath.

When the cursed Nerissa reached into my mind, it felt odd, as if a door opened. It was not only me who stood in that room alongside her. There were two sets of footsteps. Something else crossed. The flame in my chest rose, not just to protect, but to purify. My fire did not burn with vengeance. It burned with truth. She is good. And the darkness in my mind, whatever it was, recoiled. I am happy Nerissa is okay. By the gods, I am grateful. To save her, I would give all of me. I may not be the best with words. Well, spoken words, but I hope she knows from my actions, I am also her knight. Always will be.

I refrained from calling her a witch today. As much as I tease her at times, letting that word easily dance off my tongue, even in jest, it feels different now, especially after meeting a darker kind of witch. One who spills ink, soaked in sorrow and doubt, calling it the truth. Huh? She who calls it the truth is Shiori. She claims to see memories selling glimpses of the past wrapped in parchment. Fragile memories for coin. And I admit at first I thought anonymously reading some might help me get to know our comrades more. Made me excited in ways. But reading memories, though some parts were sweet, some were unfortunately sour. What she wrote for Nerissa, it stung. A cell, a sword named Thorn. No trial, no mercy. 

If it was me, if I was the one who put Narissa there, then let me never remember it. I love this version of her that has stood beside me since the last Lebestalt. Wild, beautiful, and definitely, definitely mysterious for sure. I would never dare. I would never dare ever. Never extinguish the spark of joy that she gives me. Let her not remember. If remembering means that she dims or turns away or worse, becomes something that she once was. If there was a dark reason she was placed in such a such a place, and it is the truth I have learned perhaps names do not matter only what we do with them. Witches can be good or evil. Knights can be protectors or tyrants. Even a rose can cut when all that's left are thorns. 

I will breathe. I remember the good. I have my comrades. My friends, my sister, my fire, Dawn, and of course, my loyalty as a knight. I appreciate the voices that guide me through my path. I know that you are there watching over me and I and I hold you all in my heart too. Whether you are real or not, whether you are just a dream or a faint memory. Please continue to guide me. Maybe one day we'll meet. I will let your voices be my strength. Onwards and upwards. Huzzah.
