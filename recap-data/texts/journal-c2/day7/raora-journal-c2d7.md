DAY 7
ROA PANDORA

I finally found LOVE

After working so hard to win the heart of the red knight... I realised hers was not in my hands but someone else already...

But even at my lowest point, a orange woman took my hand and helped me rise again.

And her name is SHAKIRA.

We finally got married married in front of everyone, and now we will live a happy life.

THANK YOU, SHAKIRA. I LOVE YOU.

YOU WANT TO FIND LOVE TOO???

WHY DON'T YOU BUY A GACHARM!!!

tiny treasure, infinite pleasure!!!!
