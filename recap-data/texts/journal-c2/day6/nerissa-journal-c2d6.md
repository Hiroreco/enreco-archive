**Day 6 Journal**

Dear Lorekeeper,

Today, we uncovered a secret ritual, discovered by the princess herself! Though, we need eachother to solve it. We showed Lady Bloodflame the Knights Suite, which was... more unassuming than I was expecting. Perhaps Mordan Ramsey should work on making their rooms more... adequate. We enjoyed jumping on the bed, however. I also had a duel with Lady Bloodflame, 3 to be exact.

She beat me twice, but I won the final duel, winning a prize: a gorgeous ring. Quite lovely, quite happy to have it. Yes. We also discovered a strange temple of sorts, hiding under my storefront. Odd, I don't remember building such a thing? In it are my painting, and several of my poetry books, I do not know how or why they are there, but now I feel a strong urge to leave them as they are.

So many strange occurances - I also recieved a memory from Shiori of the Novella. It's very strange, and that's all i will say. I also found 5 of 7 children playing hide-and-seek, I wonder where the rest could be?
Today was quite tiring, but I'm looking forward to the end of the world

Sincerely,
Nerissa
