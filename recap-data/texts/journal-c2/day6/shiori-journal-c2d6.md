<!-- title: Shiori's Journal Entry: Day 6 -->

**Day 6**

Today was the preparation phase of a grand party in honor of HPO's constipation problem.

We are still unsure of whether that 'one' is truly giving birth, so for now - we will celebrate the upcoming end of the world with a grand,
slamming party.

There will be games such as 'Spank the Pumpkin'.

There will be food and a photographic archway with sakura blossoms gently flowing in the wind.

Lastly, there is a wonderful sign that displays boldly that

'IT'S GAS'

I hope everyone will have fun while music begins to obnoxiously play during tense moments between us warriors.

Oh, also, I believe Lady Bloodflame is furious and upset with me, but that ain't my fault.

Who was the one to constantly call the non-witch a witch after all?

In the end, you can't trust anyone.
