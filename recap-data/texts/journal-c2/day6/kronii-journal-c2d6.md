<!-- title: Tam's Journal Entry: Day 6 -->

**Day 6**

Today was quite peaceful! I am very happy! I AM VERY HAPPY WITH NO TRAUMA. The therapist was not available today! I renovated my grand abode and assisted Nyavella with a grand picnic for HPO's conception of... unknown matter.

I believe she will love the gift everyone has prepared. Afterwards, Immerkind and Gonathan visited and invited me to THAT dungeon.

The dungeon HPO, Pandora, and I could not unlock the disk for 4-5 times. I have lost count... But we have gotten it in just one attempt! It was a splendid day!

Then I heard of some tales of others involving Lady Bloodflame and Nerissa. They seem to be very close friends! Though the discussion took
place at... where Pandora... and I had to pick up...

But anyway! That does not matter anymore! I am perfectly well!

Perfectly happy! I have not seen HPO. I wonder how she's doing... I hope she is doing better. Not that it matters.

Tomorrow's another day! I am so very excited!
