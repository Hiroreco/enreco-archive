<!-- title: Fuwawa's Journal Entry: Day 6 -->

**-06-**

I am the luckiest puppy in ALL of the Kingdom of Libestal!!
I can't believe it... I sold out... So many customers!! I feel like I can't keep up with demand... But I'm doing my best!

Cake...
Milkshakes...
Soup...
I've been cooking nonstop!! Especially now that I've been chosen as the sole caterer for a very important event!!

I'm a little worried, but the best thing to get rid of worries is preparation, right? I hope I can see them smile after eating my cooking...

I don't know if my cafe is very comfy yet though... I wish that everyone would stay and eat in my cafe, but I don't think they want to yet... I need chairs. A roof. Something more welcoming... I have lots to learn. At the very least, my new window will allow me to see the festivites and results.. of my catering!! There's a lot to look forward too...

But somehow, I still feel like something is missing. A prescense...

It's puzzling...
I'll keep on doing my best! That's all I can do at times like this.
bau bau...
