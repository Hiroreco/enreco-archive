**Day 6**

Day 6 of Ninolna the HERO

MEOWMEOW

Today was a short day...but a pretty busy one...

MEOWMEOW

We were taken to uncurse the cursed tome...but something tells me...no curse is strong enough to curse me...the hero...

MEOWMEOW

After a few attempts we were able to fix? the cursed tome...what this means for us...I'm not too sure...

MEOWMEOW

There's only a little bit of time left until the prophesized end of the world...

MEOWMEOW

Surely...I'll be able to keep everyone safe...
