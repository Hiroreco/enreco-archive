<!-- title: Elizabeth's Journal Entry: Day 6 -->

**Knights Log: 0005**

I am Lady Elizabeth Bloodflame, Jade Sword Knight. Trained by Viridis. Knight of Honor. Smith of the Jade Forge.

I will keep this short.
Sleep is overdue, and I must return to the quarters where I now keep watch -making sure someone is safe.
Even now.
Especially now.

Lately, I've begun to understand what It truly means to walk the path of a knight. Not glory. Not praise. Just duty. A quiet promise made in the marrow - and perhaps if I follow it without ~ wavering, if I give all I have left to the oath, I will one day return to that place from before.
The place behind the veil of my fractured memory - where my heart was whole. Where I was not afraid of my own name. Where I did not flinch at the sound of my own sword.

I will not speak of what the witch wrote. Not in full. Not yet - but the name of my blade was there. Thorn. "Used without trial". Used to condemn. It cuts differently now.

And yet still, I rise.
I lend my sword to those who need it -even if it means I break a little more with every swing.
Kindness need not feel soft to be real.
Sometimes, it is simply what remains when everything else has burned away.

I am tired.
But I remain.

Written by the hand of Knight Bloodflame.
