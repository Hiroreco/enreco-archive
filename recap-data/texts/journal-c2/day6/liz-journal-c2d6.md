<!-- title: Elizabeth's Journal Entry: Day 6 -->

**Knights Log: 0004**

My name is Elizabeth Bloodflame. A Jade Sword KNight. Trained by Viridis. Knight of Honor. Smith of The Jade Forge.

There has been a lot of confusion weighing on my mind but the positive is there has been a lot conquered.

~~Today~~
~~The adventures I have~~
~~I ventured~~
~~I woke up today and went~~

Today was fine. I am fine.
