<!-- title: Gonathon's Journal Entry: Day 6 -->

**DAY SIX**

Today was uneventful.

It was a good day.

Not all days need to be full of excitement.

A simple day to rebalance oneself, to be grounded.

I had fun!

I do worry for Immerkind though.

My fellow wolf... what happens if she does decide to stay in the past with the princess?

Her absence will be felt.

I selfishly hope she does not stay...

But, I understand her reasonings for wanting to stay.

To be left with a giant hole in one's heart.

It is her decision to make though, ultimately I cannot sway her.

I would be happy, but it would fill her with despair.

The wolves and the pack would be there for her, but would it be enough?

Her spirits seemed to have lifted by the end of the night though.

It reminds me to truly cherish these pack bonds.

I cannot worry too much, the end of the world is still days away.

We will worry about it tomorrow.

GONATHON G.
