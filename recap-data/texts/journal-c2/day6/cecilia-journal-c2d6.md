**Kindness V**

Dearest Diary

A lot of happenings passed today. I serenaded my princess and thought she accepted my feelings however the words she said to me she apparently also said to many others.

I tumbled down from the highest of highs to the lowest of my lows....

My wolf pack and my little princess supported me in these trying times and I still believe that there is a chance for a space beside my princess for me.

However our time here is coming to an end I have to make the hardest decision of my life

Do I stay here with princess Iphania or do I leave her and go with everyone else.

Do I leave behind my pack and my friends for a future with the princess?
Or do I abandon her and leave her all by her lonesome to carry the burden of rebuilding this kingdom by herself. Even if she cannot except my feelings I want to still stay by her side.. but..
I do not want to hurt my friends either..

I do not know...
I will have to think.

I hope I can make the right decision.

May kindness touch all our hearts and guide me.

Cecilia Wolf Immerkind
