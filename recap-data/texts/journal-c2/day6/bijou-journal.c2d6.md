**JOURNAL DAY 6**

The Journal
of \[Former\] Princess
Koseki Bijou

Hark! I have discovered a brand new talent! Stealth!

I think becoming one of the people has been good for me as I discover new things about myself every day.

Today has been calm compared to days past. Instead of dwelling on my own issues, I spent the day helping others! I watched as my boss pines for her scarlet knight. I stand by her so that I am ready in case she spills her metaphorical spaghetti

In fact. I have been tailing the two all day and not once was I discovered by either of them! I think I could start a new career as a gatherer of information and a seller of secrets. Once I am satisfied at Gacharm of course.

I also have to write about my knight...My knight Immerkind...
She is madly in love with this realm's princess (I don't know why, her chest is way too large and I think her hair is fake and she does not provide itch ointment for the mosquito infestation in the castle). She loves her so much in fact that she is willing, once this journey is over, to stay in this dying world with her princess instead of returning to her own.
I fear that my knight Immerkind is ready to give up everything she knows and loves for her infatuation with the princess. It is not my place to sway my knight in either direction. I can only offer a voice of reason and hopes her final decision will be one that makes her happy, void of any regret.

Today we learned more about the curse of this realm through a magic tome and a ritual. I preformed the ritual with the peasant, my sister, and my boss. I feel unease though, as inAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM I PREGAGANANT??????

I'M NOT SURE. WE WENT THROUGHT A RITUAL TODAY AND WITH IT WE WERE CURSED BY THE TOME TO PREVENT THE RITUAL FROM COMPLETING ITSELF. AFTERWARDS, I STARTED FEELING A LITTLE BIT FUNNY...SO I HAD CONCERN THAT THE RESIDUE OF THE CURSE MAY STILL RESIDE WITHIN ME BUT...MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE DOES INSTEAD???
FOR I HAVE JUST REMEMBERED DURING A BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPING STRESSFUL CONFRONTATION WITH GONATHAN G, MY STEP MOTHER, MY BELOVED AND MY KNIGHT THAT WE DID THE SPECIAL TRADE ONCE MORE A FEW DAYS AGO. THE TRADE THAT RESULTED IN...KHAOS....

HOW COULD I HAVE FORGOTTEN SUCH AN IMPORTANT DETAIL.
WHAT DO I DO....?

HOW IS THIS TAKING IT SLOW...?

I'm sorry I'm a little overwhelmed now.

A calm day indeed.
