**Day 4 Journal**

Dear Lorekeeper,

It is the 4th day of our adventure in ancient Libestal. I have upped my chef level, and jounrnied onto the next dungeon. Tam Gandr was revealed to be a time Goddess of sorts - amazing! I'm so happy to be on the same side as her.

I was also able to remember more memories from some of my previous adventures in libestal.

It seems there was a legal battle with Moco-chan, and due to that, in a misunderstood, I told the gentle Lady Bloodflame I hated her - which could not be further from the truth... Even as a jest, I cannot believe such words would've come out of my mouth. Is that really the person I am? Someone who would hurt those who matter to her? I don't know what to think... Lady Bloodflame calls me a witch, but has been insistent that i am a good witch, but maybe she's wrong...

Maybe I am bad.

Sincerely
