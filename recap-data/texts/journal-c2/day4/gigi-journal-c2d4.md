<!-- title: Gonathon's Journal Entry: Day 4 -->

**DAY FOUR**

I started therapy today! It has helped a lot, speaking about everything that has been trapped in my mind, all of the current ongoings.

I know that I will always be able to rely on my wolves.

I still do not know if I am in love, I do not think any sort of talking with others has helped me in finding out what "love" is to me.

I suppose it is because love is different for everyone and is not so strictly defined.

I love my wolves, they are my pack.

I love my queen, as my loyalty stands with her.

And I think, maybe, that what I am feeling with Shiori of the Nyavellas is love as well.

But it has been difficult.

When I am able to proclaim my love for others so easily, why is it so difficult for me to proclaim my love for her?

What is stopping me from telling her that I love her?

I think it has something to do with the blonde angel in the previous memory unearthed.

A pearl.

Mordan Ramsay said with such certainty that I was in love once.

I do not remember what being in love was like.

Is it the love for my pack?

The love for my queen?

The love for Shiori Nyavella?

How could Mordan Ramsay have been so certain, so sure, when it's not something I recognize for myself.

I want to devote myself to Shiori of the Nyavellas, I believe I must. It is the correct thing for me to do, the "right" thing.

Would it be the right thing for me?

What is right for others...

But even then, she has the little princess.

A relationship that has spanned before this timeline, a history together.

It is not my place to push it.

Maybe in time, I will remember what it was like to love.

Maybe that love matches with the love of Shiori Nyavella.

But I cannot keep her tied to me in my indecision, in my hesitance.

Tomorrow will be a better day, I I have a therapist now after all.
