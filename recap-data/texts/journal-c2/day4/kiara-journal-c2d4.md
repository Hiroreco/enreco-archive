**Tales of Kind**

Liebes Tagebuch

Love... what is that anyway?
I see it all around me and yet it evades me As a knight, I thought I don't require such frivolous pastimes and instead feel enough satisfaction by protecting all people equally. And yet, after a loveless first chapter, this time I wanted to give myself a chance.

So far, all my attempts have failed while everyone else is surrounded by sparks. Sparks?
I thought I felt them too, with my cousin. But my cousin seems to very focused on the princess and social constructs.
But aren't we currently time travelers?
Wouldn't she have to leave the princess behind eventually anyway?
Well, I suppose that doesn't matter to her because what she feels is love...
Gonathan wasn't very helpful at being my wingman but I suppose thats alright because I wasnt either.
Although I felt my wingman duty was more towards More Than Ramsey.

Who I have failed greatly today. I saw how fulfilled with excitement and hope she was, only to be interrupted and devastated by the circumstances that I partially have created. Destroying one potential love with my hands do I really deserve any of it myself?

Well, atleast the smithery is going well, and I continue to be a great knight... but who am I really protecting?

Whatever happens tomorrow I hope it won't bring sorrow. My help they shall borrow When they cleanse the dungeon hollow.
