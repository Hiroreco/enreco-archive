**DAY 4**

Day 4 of Ninolna the Hero

The day started off slow....but I managed to finish building my small house.

MEOWMEOW

I don't know why, but my neighbor (I think) started laughing at me...it triggered some memories of the far past I did not want to remember...

With the help of other brave warriors, we managed to clear two different dungeons...dungeons? TRIALS? THE THING!

The world is ending and the story is progressing...but I believe in my fellow champions and myself...to hopefully....save this world....and many others....
