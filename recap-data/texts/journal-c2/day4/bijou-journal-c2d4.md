<!-- title: Bijou's Journal Entry: Day 4 -->

**The Journal**

What an eventful day...
Business is booming, dungeons were explored, memories of my queen mother-in-law returned. She is quite stunning indeed!

But in truth...none of that matters to me today...
Today...I redeemed myself.

The only thing that matters is her.

The one I lost with all fault of my own. Shiori Nyavella.

In a times past, we were betrothed. Happily wed with a child even. But out of jealousy and rage my emotions got the better of my and I...

I left her...both her and our child alone...

That is my one true sin.

Now in this new time, I was fine with watching her from afar. I was fine with her finding one who could fill her heart again, leaving me heavy with my own mistake. Gonathan G had eyes on her. It seemed as if she had moved on, finding love with someone else. But then...things went south for them.

I was okay..
I was okay with her loving another.
I was okay with her finding her own happiness
I was okay with being... alone.

But watching her from that window, in tears from drama and a broken heart. I couldn't do it. I couldn't leave her alone. My own heart yearns for her happiness...and perhaps...my own.

I thought I didn't need love. I thought the love of my subjects enough. I thought the dedication to my newly found business was enough. I thought...saving the world would give me the fulfillment I needed.

But I was lying to myself. The only thing I needed was her.

And perhaps. Maybe it's okay for me to be happy too, despite the mistakes I've made. This time though, I will work hard to make our bond a happy one. I know of the location of our lost child... And I will bring Khaos back to her. I have to...to make amends...
With love in my heart

I make a vow. A vow to never make her cry again. To build happiness together at the end of the world.
For Beloved Shiori Nyavella...
