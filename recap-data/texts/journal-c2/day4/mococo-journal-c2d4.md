**MOCOCO Day 4**

i'm making MONEY!! we finally made some profit!!

but...
did i make a profit? i feel like most of the charms in gacharm are supplied by me... but i'm doing my best!! and now enigmatic stones!!! i'm one of the best jewelers in all of libestal, without a doubt!!

but is that all that's needed?
what will i be remembered for?
just like the legendary memories that flood back to us with each dungeon, will i be forgotten too...?

is charms and jewels and money good enough to attain true happiness?

well, at least i'm helping others with my unlicenced therapy!!

bau bau.
