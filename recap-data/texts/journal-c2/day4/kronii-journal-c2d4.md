<!-- title: Tam's Journal Entry: Day 4 -->

**Day 4**

I have went on a quest with Morden Ramsey, Gonathan, and Nerissa to defeat Chronos. I almost got left alone due to being trapped but the magic scroll saved me after sending my prayers to the gods..

Chronos was powerful but we managed to defeat it and regain a fragment of our memory. I was surprised that I was in fact a queen of Libestal and that I was so powerful. Many peasants were jealous and in awe of the real royalty standing before them, but the feeling is understandable. I am absolutely smashing after all. I cannot believe that I had low self-confidence in myself in the past. I faced some... complications. Nothing major, just that I was framed for drowning two peasants and being accused of infidelity.

But there was no drowning in the library.

Gonathan seems to be in a difficult position after I advised him to pursue love and to seize the opportunity. His heart is pure but lost. I will try my best to make sure he does not go astray.

I don't know how to feel about living in the same space as Nyavella and Gonathan for a year. Is that still valid if they're not together anymore? I do not know anymore...

Also, did I mention just how powerful I am? Because I am. Wow like did you see that it

Hot Pink One gave me food and I upgraded her pickaxe. I do love seeing her wonderful laugh and smile. A smile of a goddess. A peasant goddess, since she is a goddess of the people, for the people. Nobody is going to read this, right? If anyone reads this, then yes, she is a peasant goddess and I do not have any interest because I am a queen. I'm simply too busy for anything. I love myself. I love myself so much. I love me. I love.

There was no drowning in the library.
