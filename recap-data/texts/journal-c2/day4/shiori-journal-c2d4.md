**Day 4: Betrayal**

It was an eventful day.

It was full of drama, misunderstandings, heartbreak, and then healing.

I spent the day considering the future of Gone of thons.

At first, I admired his noble and pure heart.

Unfortunately, with such a soul lies a dark, uncontrollable rage.

In a misunderstanding, Gonathon assumed my infedility with the Queen Tam.

And in his fury, he... pushed me off the roof during one of my attempts to console him.

This act surprised me. Perhaps he is not so gentle after all. For each light there is darkness.
The brighter the light, the greater the potential for evil.

For corruption.

I had tried to be kind.
I avoided taking all.
I took what I needed.

But in the end, I believe this kindness has backfired.

My bones ache. My heart - equally so.
But at least there is hope...

\
...in the form of a sparkly jewel.
