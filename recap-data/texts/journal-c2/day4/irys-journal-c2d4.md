**HPO's Daily Diary**
Day 4

My head feels clearer as day, as I do not hear the voices in my head today. I wonder why.

Today I cleared the dungeon of kronos(?) with my fellow brother, beloved consort, immerkind, and shakira. Through the turmoil my brain went through, we successfully cleared the dungeon. I am so glad to have such reliable friends to help me.

As for the memory we retrieved from said dungeon, it was of my sapphire. She was ever so beautiful and cool, I never felt more prouder to know that she was my sapphire.

But the moment we returned, I noticed that my sapphire, or Queen Tammy as she says, had become a changed person. The moment she called me a "peasant goddess", my world went pitch black and I didn't know what to believe in anymore. Despair overtook my faith in people.

I thought I couldn't trust her or depend on her for anything anymore.

And so I heard that immerkind, the reliable supplier was offering her services for a reasonable price. Just as I was about to take the deal, Tammy appeared before me and took me to the side, to offer the same services for free.

In order to keep suspicions away from other people, along with immerkind who thought I was going to buy her services, I went ahead and made an extra pickaxe to go ahead with the deal.

I now have 2 fully enchanted pickaxes :D

The head chef has also taught me new recipes. Surely these recipes will help me become closer to my fellow kin.

My current goal is to somehow convince my consort to accept the In-Breadtheren. She is a tough cookie but I believe she will pull through.
