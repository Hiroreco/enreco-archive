<!-- title: Fuwawa's Journal Entry: Day 4 -->

**-04-**
I had my first guest today... her name was Immerkind. I think she just trying to sell me pickaxes, but just having someone to keep me company in my cafe made me happy... It made me imagine what it would be like to have a party with a buch of friends, laughing, and eating...

But I missed my chance. I should have made her something to eat... I'm still not confident though...

And my friend, Moco-chan... I thought that she'd stay by my side forever in my cafe, but I guess only a few grass seeds isn't enough to keep her away from... freedom, from more than just myself. It hurts, but I understand.

I became a stronger adventurer, but I'm not sure if I'm getting closer to my dream... I feel like I gettting further away. I still haven't had anyone come by cafe and enjoy my cooking...

My sales still sit at 0. Should I even look and get my hopes up?

There are so many amazing chefs... They even offer free soup. I don't know if I can do that...

Hang in there, me.
I just have to believe...
