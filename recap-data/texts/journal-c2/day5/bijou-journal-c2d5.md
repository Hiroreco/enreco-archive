**JOURNAL DAY 5**

The Journal
of \[Former\] Princess
Koseki Bijou

Oh journal...
where do I begin...
I feel like I have learned so many... lessons today.

I fear maybe...I am not suited for true society. I have learned now...that being a Princess has caused me to be quite sheltered...hidden from the true harsh realities of the world...

Relationships...
Therapy...
Child Support...
Court...

Does the average citizen really have to go through all of this?

It feels like the true world that we live in is not just...adventuring, exploring, joy, and whimsy.

I have learned to face that truth today.

Spending my hard earned coin to pay for therapy...just to have it make the situation worse.
Wasting time fighting with the one who cares for my child...instead of just communicating my intentions to have a happy family...

Is this really the world that we live in...?

If so...I am beginning to question everything... For the first time in my journey...
I fear I am losing my spark...my hope. That this is indeed a good place. That what we're working so hard for might be futile...

For I have seen true human nature today...and it feels like when people are brought together, seeds of chaos are planted and conflict emerges from its soil...

Today is the first day I truly doubt myself...my purpose...

What am I...here for?

I have tried to remain a good person. I do my best to remain trusting of my beloved even though my heart shouts at me that something is wrong Every time I open my heart to feel...to try to do the right thing... it just goes south...

Is there no place for a 'good' person in this world? Will I never redeem myself?

Right now...I just... don't know...

We will have to see what tomorrow brings.
