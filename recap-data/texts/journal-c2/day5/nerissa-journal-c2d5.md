**Day 5 Journal**

Dear Lorekeeper,

Today, I completed two dungeons. First, the Chronos dungeon with Pandora and Lady Bloodflame, and then the chaos dungeon and chaos is a word that well suits the turmoil in both my heart and mind. Even if I no longer feel as though I am the person I was previously, having forgot those memories does not absolve me of my sins of the past. Still, I feel so distant from the person that I was before. But it is so, that she and I are one in the same.

I went to my first therapy sessions today, after having (regretably) looked through a chest addressed to lady Bloodflame - it containted roses. In that moment, I realized that she has mkany suitors. With the way she hath treated me, I feel as though it may signal the end of the connection i _thought_ we might have. of course, I want to be happy for her, and support her, so even if I must harden my own heart, I shall resolve myself to desire her happiness in love over my own selfish desires. Mordan Ramsey did give me hope, during our therapy session today, but I still feel like I may not have the ability to build up enough swagger to confess. I could Lady Bloodflames cold emotions today, despite not knowing what I had done.

She removed her painting from our shrine together, and she ignored my letter addressing it. I very much fear all is lost, and cannot stop myself from crashing out. So it is how it shall be.

Sincerely,
Nerissa Pickles Mustard Linkin Park Juliet Bloodflame Ravencroft
