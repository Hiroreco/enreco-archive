<!-- title: Hot Pink One's Journal Entry: Day 5 -->

HPO's Daily Diary
Day 5

Today was a great day.

It was a long day.

I cleared the dungeon of chaos. I was not able to obtain the hidden treasure that the dungeon holds even after 3 more attempts. Those 3 attempts were made with my light pink kitty cat, and my sapphire.

I had learned that my sapphire had kept a secret relationship with my kitty cat during the dungeon runs. We were absolutely heartbroken by her but have learned to forgive her under the conditions that she serve us as a maid. She agreed to said terms and even cleaned up after my kitty cat.

It was only after my kitty cat went to bed, that the maid suddenly had a different idea of what we agreed upon.

I find it concerning but I understand that she is going through a lot.

She did give me roses, ones that I gladly accepted.

It was then that I suddenly felt a pang of pain in my abdomen. My guts tell me that the sensation that I experienced, was the gift of life. The others around me kept telling me otherwise but I believe that my consort and I's love had brought forth a new life into this world.

My maid was distressed at the idea, and suddenly threatened me with violence and abusive words. The stress of having the gift of life in me, along with being slandered by someone I thought accepted me for who I was (who btw was also keeping a hidden relationship, and in my defense, my consort and I's relationship was very much public information.) made me have thoughts of not continuing my life any longer.

I was so cornered, I found myself at the edge of a cliff. My guard dog, Gonathan, Tammy aka my sapphire, and my brother all tried to stop me. But I couldn't contain my sadness and I flew for 5 seconds until I suddenly awoke again in a new life. I learned that the others followed suit and it was then that I learned that I had so many people who cared for me.

The only concerning thing is that right after my new life started, I didn't feel the pangs of pain in my abdomen that I felt before. My gift of life... I can't bear at the thought of the possibility of losing the precious gift between me and my consort. Thankfully, after having a meal, the gift had returned once again as pains in my abdomen.

My brother and her beloved are helping me plan a gender reveal party for my consort. I am so excited to surprise her with the multiple gifts I prepared, along with the special news.

I can't wait to greet this new life to this world.
