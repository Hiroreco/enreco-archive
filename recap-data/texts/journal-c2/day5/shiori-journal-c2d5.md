**Day 5**

Diary 5

I am uncertain as to what has happened today.

Family court drama was not on my list of things to expect.

In an attempt to acquire Khaos (but the K is in reverse), the Jeweled one requested family therapy; unfortunately, the therapist was a little biased against me.

As they settled things between the Peasant, the Jeweled One, & Gonathon (who was there for emotional support),

I heard her mumble '[beeping] crazy'. Three of us have heard it in fact.

I was astonished. Flabbergasted. Felt devastated. Psychologically slapped in the brain.

Instead of helping us, she made things worse.

Fortunately, over some tea and a calming cabin, we managed to set aside our differences.

No money payments. Just love and support to our new family member (and Gonathon).

Because in this world...

....when there is nothing but Ruin and the Stained...

...State Farm is there.

Oh, also, I think I just joined a brotherhood and we purified your therapist chair.
_Wink_ Might not want to sit there anymore.
I didn't even have to lift a finger.
