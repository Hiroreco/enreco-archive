<!-- title: Gonathon's Journal Entry: Day 5 -->

**DAY FIVE**

Another eventful day, though, this day better than the last.

I have come to realize many things about myself, some very difficult truths that I needed to face on my own.

I still do not know what "love" is, people speak of it so freely, is it really that easy to love?

If it was, then why is everything so difficult.

I want to devote myself but I can never commit, and in doing so, I've hurt many others in my wake.

People say me kind, even when I try to convince them of it otherwise.

But really, I have been cruel.

It is something only I can fix, a thing I must stop putting onto others to solve for me.

But speaking to the princess today has been quite enlightening!

Who am I fighting for?

What does Libestal mean to me?

It is a knights sworn duty to protect others, to be a shining example onto the community.

I have not been doing a very good job at it as of late.

But, slowly, day by day, I will remember, my faith and my loyalty.

Remember my honor.

To the ends of the world.

I hope to save it, and myself.
