**Family :)**

Day 5

What a day...

A happy family regardless of its shape filled with love is the kind of family one can only hope for..

I vow and pledge my life to protecting my children.

I will strive and seek success if it will give me the opportunity to give my children the childhood they deserve.

I look forward to co-parenting with Koseki Bijou, Shiori Novella and Gonothan.

...I'll find you Charlie.

Tomorrow marks the beginning of new tidings....

MY heart is pounding but I believe that with the help of Gonothan the wingman... She will understand and hopefully reciprocate these blossoming emotions.

We can only pray.
