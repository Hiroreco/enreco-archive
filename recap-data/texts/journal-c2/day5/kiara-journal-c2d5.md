**Tale of Kind**

Liebes Tagebuch

I was able to make sure that my apology letter that I wrote to Ninoina about the misunderstanding at her house was received well and we are on
good terms, verily.

Besides that, for the first time in a while I managed to interact with the Roa cat. I may be a strong intimidating knight, but I have a huge soft, weak spot for cats.

I gave her the biggest scritchscrotches and mlemmlems and then took her on a trip with the wolf pack dawgs Gonathan and Mordan.

Actually I was surprised that after all that transpired yesterday, Mordan was in such neutral spirits and ready to go on another adventure with Gonathan right away. Is it cope or is she really okay? I am still worried about her wellbeing.
In order to give them some sweet icebreaking bonding time I pretended to sense fleas on Gonathan and suggested for Mordan to groom him like dawgs would do!

It was and endearing sight to behold indeed.

Also I was able to support Elizabeth today in her endeavor of catching up to me. There was a really challenging fight for many of us today after the dungeon, for which I lent her some strengthening rations! Miraculously, immediately she managed to take him down. I think, she always had it in her. She thought the food was the reason for her success, but I think she just needed a little push.
