<!-- title: Kronii's Journal Entry: Day 5 -->

**Day 5**

I cleared the dungeon with HPO, the peasant, and Ninolna and regained a fragment of our memory. The peasant was a genie in a dice, which was surprising. I wanted to purchase charms at Gacharm but the prices increased from 200 to 400. I could not afford it-I mean, I could but I had to leave some for future purchases. And so, using my memory, I told Pandora that we were betrothed to one another in the past world. Pandora, touched, gave me a legendary charm.

I felt terrible as I was already in love with another woman, who already had a consort. I spent the rest of the night mulling over the events and regretting my actions.
The next day, I went on to clear the dungeon once again with HPO and Pandora, which was a nervewracking situation after recent events, but I hoped that nothing would go wrong.

I was wrong...

Pandora began to unravel the events that happened at Gacharm and my reputation and respect went down understandably so. In order to repent, I had to beg for forgiveness and their deal was that I was to become their maid and be at their beck and call. I felt humiliated when I had to say, "My beloved masters, your lovely maid is here."

I am a queen and to be ashamed by the one I thought was the love of my life is breaking me.

After the third attempt, we still did not receive the gift of the dungeon but at least my suffering was over. I called Gonathan to see how he was doing and my voice unfortunately cracked, which he could tell. We went to our usual meeting spot and there I confessed to everything that had transpired.

Everything was a blur but when I went to the library to write today's entry, HPO was there and she decided to use today's deal to make me say the phrase and today's events to Nyavella and Koseki Bijou. I had to tell Gonathan to look away as I began to display such pitiful behaviour. I hope that he didn't see it.

Afterwards, HPO confessed that she might have a child and we were all shocked. I decided to look for Gonathan but HPO decided to come after me to once again repeat that she was pregnant with the consort. I was hurt, furious, and confused. She was hurt by my words and ran off. She threatened to throw herself off the cliff and called her brother, Koseki Bijou. Then, the three threw themselves off the cliff towards their death. I attempted to do the same but I survived the fall.

Afterwards, HPO's pregnancy turned out to be mere constipation from overconsumption.

Things are still not resolved completely but I believe that with the bouquet I gifted HPO, maybe things will be better now...

Being queen is suffering.
