**Day 2 Journal**

Dear Lorekeeper,

Today was rather interesting. I finished my quests, then embarked on a jounrey to a dungeon of both heaven and hell with Fuwawa, Immerkind, and Lady Bloodflame. Strange, after I completed it, I not only recalled my memories of Irys, but I also seemed to recover some memories of our previous time in Libestal... The stain king, the king, Lady Bloodflame, my (embarassing) unrequited marriage to Shiori of the Novella... But I also remembered things about myself...

I feel a bit... conflicted... Almost like, I was someone I truly do not recognize. That's all for now, I'll sit with these thoughts.

Sincerely,
Nerissa Ravencroft
