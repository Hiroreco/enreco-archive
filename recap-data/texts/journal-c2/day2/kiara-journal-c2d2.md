<!-- title: Kiara's Journal Entry: Day 2 -->

**Tales of Kind 2**

Today, after fulfilling my duties as a lorekeeper for the first time, with new insights into all of the adventures of this kingdom, I went on to efficiently go about my day.

The dungeon, together with the Jeweler guild and More Than Ramsey, who blends in nicely with them as a pink woman, was a great challenge, but nothing could have possibly stopped us.

Teamwork and the power of friendship guided us through.

After the dungeon, great improvements in equipment awaited me and others. Again, great deals have been struck with the Jewelers and I continued to be generous and kind with my own creations - but today I did charge a little bit and may have gained a small, humble fortune.

With my current potential fully unlocked and unleashed, I feel fulfilled and appeased.

Tomorrow shall be another successful day - or perhaps, should I say, wait for it-------
