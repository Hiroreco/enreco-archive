<!-- title: Shiori's Journal Entry: Day 2 -->

**Day 2**

Today was a successful day of observation.

I was able to study the 'character' of many individuals.

My plan of dominating the economy (poorly) was a failure, unfortunately.

This world's logic doesn't work as expected (which should've been expected.)

A murder most fowl chickens hatched from eggs vanish from existence the moment you vanish from their sight.
So much for my fried chicken conspiracy.

Wubba lubba dub dub.

I'm just a humble witch living in a decrepit, rotting wooden husk of a hut.
