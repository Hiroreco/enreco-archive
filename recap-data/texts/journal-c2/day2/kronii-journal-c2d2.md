<!-- title: Tam's Journal Entry: Day 2 -->

**DAY 2**

It was a quiet day but fortunately, Hot Pink One was around to help. She baked many food varying from cakes to potatoes, it was truly wonderful. We took on a dungeon together and slayed the two-headed dragon named Elpis, I believe. Then, I was able to unlock a memory fragment which revealed HPO to be a queen! It was truly an astounding "revelation" (heh). Afterwards, I was able to upgrade my skills as a supplier and upgraded HPO's pickaxe. I also unlocked a new field and mined some new ores but there lies more vicious monsters. Absolutely horrid creatures...

HPO serenaded me with a song sung for her people. I still remember some parts of the lyrics... she mentioned "lava chicken" and "flint and stone". I called her a lyrical genius and she too called me one.

I fear that I am falling in love with a royalty but I do know that it cannot be for she is taken by another. However, I am satisfied with this current situation.

I purchased two upgrade stones but I realize that I now need a greater upgrade stone. I have been deceived by the anvil... I am now selling the basic stone for 100 COINS.

1 0 0 C O I N S.
I BOUGHT IT FOR 149 COINS BUT IT IS NOW

1 0 0 C O I N S.

in my house made of mossy cobblestone in the corner.

Oh, if only some someone could take it from my hands for 1 0 0 C O I N S that I purchased for 1 4 9 C O I N S.

It would be a STEAL. If only someone could STEAL it from me for a GOOD PRICE, like new. Barely used.
