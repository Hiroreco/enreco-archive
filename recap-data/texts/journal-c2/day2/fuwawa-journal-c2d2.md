<!-- title: Fuwawa's Journal Entry: Day 2 -->

**-02-**

I'm starting to get used to this place. Maybe, I'm even growing too...

I was happy to be able to go on adventure today with Nerissa (AKA Mustard), Elizabeth, and Immerkind! It wasn't an easy dungeon, but we did all together!

I learned a lot of new recipes, and most importantly opened up my shop!! My dream!! But.. I don't know if anyone will visit. If anyone will ever eat my cooking. Maybe that's okay...

No, it's not... I want to be praised. I want everyone to smile!! But compared to all the otther chefs... I don't know if that will ever happen... I don't even know the detail about my cooking pot, how to grow my ingredients, or about the cooking guild and regulations...

But I'll continue to be positive. And hopefully, maybe through my cooking and everyone's kindness, I can gain confidence... bau bau...!!
