<!-- title: Hot Pink One's Journal Entry: Day 2 -->

Daily Diary of HPO
Day 2

Today was a great day.

I ended up staying in Libestal longer than I had planned.

I have conquered the Elpis Dungeon with my Consort and friends (including a peasant) and have understood how important it is to cooperate and to have a ton of food.

The two headed dragon was terrifying. Thank god I was chef and had cheffed up my inventory.

I have learned that the jewelers plotted to swoop up everyone's fortunes with their jewel gacha system. Thankfully I have made connections that will keep my gold safe and sound.

I have made 40 gold revenue through my shop. Mind you, that 40 gold was from pity from a friend. Nonetheless it was still business. But I have learned that my food has more value than just mere gold. It can be used to barter with other people in their respective professions for their services.
Who cares about my store. I don't.

I was invited by immerkind to the creek with her, a peasant, a lighter pink cat, and my brother. We drank stain souls till dawn and bonded under the influence of alcohol I was questioning immerkind's kindness with her short whispers of "peasant" whenever the peasant passed by, but I eventually understood it was not a big deal I witnessed her mingling with the peasant in a very suggestive manner. I wonder if I will be able to witness their date one day.

Will they have offspring that would also be peasant? That is the actual question.

Through that creek gathering, I was able to bond with the light pink cat and have vowed to keep her belly bursting with food and plump. She is one lucky cat She must know that I make the finest dishes.

I have killed many stains today. So many, that I now have a total of 6293 coins. My savings will all go to my lavish gift I have planned for my consort eternal I really hope she will like it.

Oh i see peasant has logged in bc she probably forgot to write in the diary.

I have also seen my brother around. She was not handling the alcohol very well and it made me a very concerned Oniichan.

I have fulfilled my oniichan duties by leaving my brother a lavish gift of about? 10 chocolate cakes. She mentioned many times yesterday how much she liked cake. I have not been told DAISUKI today, something that I am totally not salty about. Maybe its a good thing. It just means that I was not exploited today. I hope she will be elated from the gift. I told her my birthday was tomorrow. I seek a bountiful return.

People left me one person at a time until I was eventually alone in this cruel world.

It was only then that Tammy, now nicknamed Sapphire, appeared in my empty world. I secretly call her Sapphie in my heart. She is wonderful company, and I assisted her in clearing the Elpis Dungeon. I carried hard.

I would say about half of the day I was trying to hunt chickens for eggs. I eventually thought up of a plan to hatch chickens in my house. I successfully laid 2 chickens and had them locked up in my abode. When I came back with milk, they were gone. I wonder where they went. We will never know.

I, as a very experienced chef, have now learned how to make some ridiculously expensive milkshakes, and chicken cutlets. Hopefully they will help me build more connections and friends along the way.
Who cares about cash.

Today, was a good day.
