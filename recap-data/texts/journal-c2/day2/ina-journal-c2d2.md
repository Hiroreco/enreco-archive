**DAY 2**

Day 2 of Ninolna the HERO

MEOWMEOW

Today we embarked on a new journey for the memories....the...something chains...memories....

MEOWMEOW

I have learned that my dear consort eternal perhaps... enjoys drinking a little too much...after her 10th drink....we don't mention what happens after the 10th drink...

MEOWMEOW

but it's okay...because I gifted her a lucky charm...a part of my heart...to hopefully keep her safe... in these dangerous times....

MEOWMEOW

Until we can find more fragments of other people's memories....I will continue being...the hero...everyone needs...

MEOWMEOW
