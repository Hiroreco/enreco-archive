<!-- title: Elizabeth's Journal Entry: Day 2 -->

**Knights Log 0002**

My name is Elizabeth Bloodflame. A Jade sword knight. Trained by Viridis. Knight of Honor. Smith of The Jade Forge! - I still remember.

The Jade Forge is coming together! Though will and fire!
It is glorious to witness and I partially owe this due to my fellow knight Shikira - a sweet flame - warm and exciting. I imagine she a good example to teach others that not all fires consume.

It feels good to learn something new. To master and shape steel.

I know Thorn is just a sword but I swear sometimes I feel Thorns spirit happily stir. Getting stronger to protect others makes us feel at ease - knowing when the going gets tough we have the power to help.

I want to do good.

I want to be ready when the winds of battle rise as high as the stains in the skies.
A fragment of Fia's memories have returned. The outlander seems an interesting fellow, as soon as I heard of this masked swordsman it did intrigue me.

I hope to learn more - I shall observe closely.

My quiet monitoring continues. I have acquired the help of Immerkind when it comes to the concern of the stained princess. It is a strange feeling I have when I am with her and a few others.

My flame flickers strangely near them -not in a way of warning but a way of longing. A magnetic pull- a feeling of wanting to reach out and hug them embrace whenever I am close, but I hold back in case it is my body and mind playing tricks on me due to the toll of time-travel.

Still, I write. Even if it feels like I'm speaking in a language the world forgot. Perhaps this is meant for eyes feel like they watch over me - or for those I've not yet met, or have already lost. But I write all the same. So that they might know: I endure and I am ok.

She ventured with me. She gifted me roses today. She kissed me. She's remembering more. Nerissa Ravencroft... Is it ok giving her more newer memories when we face such challenges, am I worthy of being part of them? what if I'm only rewriting a story I was never truly in?

Still, She is beautiful -... whenever I look into her eyes I feel a guilt coil like a serpant in the pit of my stomach. It is probably her charm effect she places on all knights. A spell. A curse. Or perhaps something older than memory.

I fear too early, for my mind misgives; Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
Shall bitterly begin.

I shall keep tight my sword, hold steady and keep my honor unbroken.
Until my own memory fades or destiny snuffs my flame I will go onwards and upwards.

Written by the hand of Lady Elizabeth Bloodflame.
