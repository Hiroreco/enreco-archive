**DAY 2 of PB**

Day 2

Today I experienced something new....

The heartstrings?....
my chest felt tight...

i consumed a beverage that seemed to change the physics of my body...

Mother always warned me about this..

She always said this day would come...

After tragic loss, one loses themself in drink...

But it is in the darkest of times, where something blooms...

The possibility....

of...

courtship....

I smell a change in the breeze...

only time will tell..
