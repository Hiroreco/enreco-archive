What a splendid day!
I turns out maybe I am suited for life in "customer service" (or at least that's what Gonathan G calls it) after all!

GaCharm is now ready to open for business!
Last evening, I spent ample time to make sure this realm could experience the joy of "gacha" and finally my dreams come to fruition!

I truly hope that many customers come and visit our fine establishment!

It is truly a joy to work with my boss, my sister, and my bau olIIIIIIIIlydtjjol sorry I don't know what came over me... it was like a foul beast posessed my body for a moment.

Anyways, it is an honour to run a shop with them!

I explored my first dungeon today! It felt like light work with my amazing team! Though...afterwards memories of my onii-chan flooded back to me in an instant. I did not know onii-chan was such a drunkard...

BUT THAT'S OKAY because afterwards, Onii-chan took me out for my first drink with her comrades! You hear that journal? I get to be one of the cool kids too!

Unfortunately...that "coolness" did not last as the influence of tainted drink was too much for me and I sucumbed to my narcolepsy, collapsing on to the ground as a log from a fallen tree right in front of my onii-chan and all her friends...

I write this after

waking up again in an empty field, with a slight bump on my head from my fall...

How embarassing... Let's hope tomorrow is a better day.
