**MOCOCO DAY 2**

today i became a stronger jeweler!! in every way!! both in attack, in defense, and in health!! but also in my skills as a jeweler!

i feel like the store GACHARM is depending on me to make sure that we're well stocked, but yet, I feel like the charms aren' really selling...

why am i not making sales? i feel like i'm just losing money making our stock when I've only got 100g in return...

maybe i need to try... other sales tactics.

but at least I'm stronger today that the other day.

BAU BAU.
