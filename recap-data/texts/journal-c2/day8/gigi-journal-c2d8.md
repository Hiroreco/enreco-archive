<!-- title: Gonathon's Journal Entry: Day 8 -->

**FINAL ENTRY**

DAY EIGHT,

The final diary.
I'm afraid that I have very little time to write this final entry, I have one minute until the final banquet!

A victory banquet!
It has been a long week, not all of it good, but it was necessary.

I think, with these final 20 seconds,

all it is, in the end, is stay truthful to yourself.

Until the next time we meet.

Gonathon G.
