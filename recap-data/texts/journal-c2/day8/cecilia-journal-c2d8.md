**KINDNESS VII**

Dear Diary

And with that our current adventure comes to an end.

There were many happy moments and many hardships but we all overcame them together.

Thank you Fia for helping me meet the princess. Thank you to my wolves and my little princess and many more I have remembered more along the way!

Thank you voices in my head for making sure I was never straying to far from the correct path.
BE IMMERKIND!
