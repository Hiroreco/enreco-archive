<!-- title: Shakira's Journal Entry: Day 8 -->

**Tales of Kind** ðŸ’—

Lorekeeper duties were an honor
Smithing was a cool job
Lady Bloodflame was the best roommate
Nerissa was a neighbour
Cecilia was my cousin
Roa became my wife, waifu for laifu

Stains have been cleansed
World has been saved

The girls are all crazy
It makes me happy

\#ENreco forever
