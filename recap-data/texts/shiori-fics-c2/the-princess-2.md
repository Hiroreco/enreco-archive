<!-- title: The Princess #2 -->

After the intense and magical encounter with the Truck Driver, the Princess gasped when the far off school bell rang.

Ring, ring, ring!

"Oh nyo! I'm late! I'm super duper late!" Though she wished to exchange names with the driver........ by the time she exclaimed her worries and turned her attention back to the Monochromed one, she was already gone....

"Oh nyo! My fated one! Curse thee! This day shall rue its day!"

And with that, she launched herself to the moon.

Her speed was just as fast as Kronii Coin stonks-no even FASTER than said stonks.

She launched herself into space then crash landed right into [REDACTED] academy, right into the homeroom.

The teacher, Yoogoo, shook his head.

"You go to baby jail."

And with those words alone, the Princess was immediately teleported to detention.

"Mother beeper!" The princess was sulking at her desk.

There was nothing to do in detention after all!

She had no turn at the XBOX. No Playstation in sight. There was not even a silly Switch.

Luckily for her, however, in the corner of the room,...in a little emo corner were some bright pair of flashlight eyes.

"Oh. Nice to see you again."

"What the beep!? That voice! Could it be....? Is that you, Truck-Driver-chan?"
The princess gasped!

GGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP.

And then her heart went even more doki doki. But this time, times three. So it was doki doki doki doki doki doki.
"Welcome. To Doki Doki Literature Club," Truck Driver said.

"In this world, it's also known as Detention. In here you have a few other members.
I doubt you'll mess with my gang, or you'll be messing with Oopy Goopy, General unchkin Man, Lil Jim, Bob, and worst of all. Larry. And no one ever messes with the Lobster."

The Princess glanced at the others, her jeweled eyes making brief contact with the 'Lobster'.
The 'Lobster' stared back, its pinchers pinching.
"I am Larry. The Lobster. You don't mess with me or the gang, and I don't mess with you."

"N-ni-nice to meet you all!" The Princess Isqueaked.
"I-I hope we can become friends... in this amazing world of Doki Doki Literature Club aka detention."
And so, her fun school days began.
