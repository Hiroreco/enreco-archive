<!-- title: Bloodraven Smut -->

The Blood Drop uwu'd at the sight of Edgar Allan Poe's Raven.

She felt MOIST. Felt universally 0 negative upon the mere sight of the birded fellow.

The birded one ca-cawed, its mating call travelling far and wide reaching the distant mountains.

"Nice caw, bro," the Universally 0 negative Blood whispered.

"If only Universal Studios can see what a STUD U Are," it added, their cheeks flushing a deep, crimson red.

"You are 50 my blood type," said the flaven.

"I would let you donate blood to me anytime, anywhere, anyday," it crooned, Lits feathers ruffling at the passionate liquid oozing out of such a lustful drop.

"You're making my blood pressure increase so much. I'm going to have to go to the hospital soon."

The Blood XD'd so hard as the words left its IV drip.

"I AM DRIPPING WITH MAD, PURE LUST FOR YOU, MILADY! I am feeling oh so woozy. Is this... extreme, intense, and oh so good bloodloss?!"

Drip. Drip. Drop. IV Drip drop.

Blood was beginning to evaporate from the steamy intense heat of this.

The Raven shook her head and said, "Never more. Never more. You will crave Forever more when I'm done with you, my Lenore."
