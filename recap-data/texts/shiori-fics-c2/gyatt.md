"\[REDACTED\], sparkling \[xxxxx\] of \[xxxxx\]!"

She shimmered in the sun, her lithe body reflecting the light, displaying an array of bright, beautiful, vibrant colors.

Yet, for every D gorgeous color gleamed from her body.....

....was a shadow growing in the hearts of man.

They grew envious Demanding. FReckless. And would sooner steal her joys away than let her be.

It troubled her. All she ever wanted was to live in peace after all.

And, in another timeline, she did.

She found the hobby of 'gaming'.

She immersed herself in brutal scenarios.

Souls of Dark, Borne of Blood, and various titles called to her.

She gamed them all.

And she enjoyed every bit of it while surrounded by her most trustworthy \[xxxxxx\].

Every Hunt of Monsters.

Every Punk of Cybers.

She forgot about the greed of mankind, and simply lived.

With her family known as '\[xxxxxx\]', she lived her life to the fullest.

She gamed.

She smiled.

And, most importantly, she laughed with a squeaky, window wiper laugh.
