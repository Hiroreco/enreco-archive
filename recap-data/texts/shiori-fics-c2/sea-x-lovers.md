<!-- title: Sea x Lovers -->

Once upon a time, (in a world beyond this one, where the lands were not ravaged by corruption and the Void, there lived a red, talking crab with a love of money.

This crab, in his quest for gold and riches, started a business with a green, tiny thing.

"Mr.Krabby," the green thing said, "I love the way your eyestalks portrude from your shell.'

Flustered, the red crab turned red as a hard boiled lobster the compliment shaking the foundations of its crustaceous carapace.

The days passed by beautifully between the two.

They walked through sand fields, anemone forests, and naughty coral reefs shaking in the water.

Alas, some good things come to an end.

Greed took hold of them. Rather than Krabby x Plinkton it became Krabby x Money.

The green thing was set aside for an even greener thingâ€”cash. Cold, hard cash. Something that hardens Krabby even more than Plinkton

And so, this is a tale to warn you all.

Don't get greedy. Or else you suck.
