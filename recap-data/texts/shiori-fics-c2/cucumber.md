<!-- title: Cucumber-->

"No jetpacks!" the pink panther nagged at for the 1,000th time.

The \[xxxxxxx\]'s ears drooped, their eyes glistened with tears.

Their tails even dropped in disappointment.

"B-b-but mama!"

"No!" She crossed her arms and spun away quickly.

"I said no!"

The \[xxxxxxx\] jeered, their behavior shifting from being on the verge of tears to a rebellious glare.

"What about cucumbers!?"

The blue gatorade colored furries cheered at the sound of 'cucumbers', their tails now wildly swaying back and forth in agreement.

"Cucumbers against tyranny, brothers," one furry said.

The pink panther glared @ the outburst.

"No!"

"But the others have jetpacks! Some even have mechas! Why do we furried beings not get anything, mama!?"

"Yeah, mama! Is it because you're Italian?!"

"I hate spaghetti!"

And then a random insult of, "I love pineapple on pizza," echoed through the crowd.

The pink cat shook her head, wagged her finger in dismay towards the furry children, and repeated firmly once more, "NOOoooOo!'
