"Flip faster," the boss yelled.

The flame-haired woman sighed but obeyed, her hands mechanically flipping, frying, and assembling.

"Welcome to Galaxy Burger!" she then greeted the cat customers with.

Her name was \[REDACTED\], and today was her first time working at the fast food joint.

In this realm she and her boss, \[xxxxxx\], I would travel far and wide to various planets to serve burgers, fries, and shakes to the planetary denizens.

Her boss, strangely enough, was someone with a criminal background a life of prison breaks and theft among a long list of 'sins'.

Despite such a troubled past, here she was simply flipping burgers beside her.

And, \[REDACTED\], despite having such a high moral compass, seemed to feel comfortable.

They bantered and shared childhood Istories, as if they were not meant to be enemies on opposing sides.

In the world of Galaxies and Burgers, it was all just in good fun after all.

Not even the Gods would bother to come here in such a realm.

And so, \[REDACTED\] would be safe from reprimand.... for now.
