"Hiyya, darlings!"

The fat flocks swarned to her, their penlights waving wildly in the air as she prepared to sing her first tune for the day.

"\[REDACTED\] here of \[REDACTED\], your one and only devilish diva!"

They cheered. Hearts in their eyes. Feathers ruffled.

The MASSIVE, FAT CROWDS of FLOCKING BIRDS rejoiced.

She enticed them with song.

And attempted to seduce many with her 'Rizz'.

Though her FAT FLOCKS were impressed, the others in her party... were not.

Despite their 'rizzistance, she was still adored by them just not in the way she might've wanted.

They adored her for her considerate self.
For her kindness.
For her wet cat' aura.

She was...
\[REDACTED\] of
\[REDACTED\].

And with, or without, memories - she would always be part of \[REDACTED\].

And, in the background, was someone who monitored such a siren.

For work? For pleasure? Or because she's a danger.

It's hard to say.
