<!-- title: The Cell -->

"Back, you foul witch!" With her massive Greatsword known as 'Thorn', the valiant knight poked at the Ravened one with her sword, her eyes a heated glare.

"Kyaa! Why are you calling me such a thing? What have I ever done to you?"

"You bewitched me! You cursed me! You have uttered unspeakable hexes!" The blue flames grew larger as the Rozen Maiden grew heated.

Was she red out of anger? Fury? Did the Ravened one truly cast such atrocities?

She could not recall.

"But I have been nothing but the utmost kind to you," she defended herself with, her eyes downcast.

But in the Raven's heart was doubt because of what she has been told.
The Rozen Maiden pushed her into the cell, locking it with a decisive click.

"I dare not trust your words, but you are a danger - so locked up you must."

The Ravened one, now left all alone, cried. She rattled against the magic barriers, hoping for release. An actual trial.

There were none.

And so, now accompanied by only defeaning silence, she sang - a melancholic melody as her only friend.

Little did she know, a monochromed prisoner was able to hear it all.
