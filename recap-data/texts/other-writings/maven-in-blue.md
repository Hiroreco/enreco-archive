<!-- title: Maven in Blue -->

Here's the full poem for Maven in Blue:
"And thus, in a field of wilting lilacs
Two black wings grew upon her back
Tearing through flesh, her blood soaking in
To the cold ground below, which accepted its sin
With a heart void of luster, of love, and of glee
Her cold, empty eyes had fallen on me

I knew she had been the person I'd sought
But my search was in vain, the journey for naught
For she had been taken, transformed you could say
Her soul left to wander, while body decays
But still, from her husk, a smile emerged
And I felt a relief, too complex for words

Her lips gently parted and sang out a tune
I moved like the tide, being pulled toward the moon
Her song sweet as honey, it lowered my defenses
and before I knew it, she engulfed all my senses
It mattered not what she intended to do
I entrusted my fate to the maven in blue"
