<!-- title: A Knight's Tale -->

Once upon a time, there was a knight, he traveled the roads alone, for he had no purpose.

There was an emptiness in him, for he had lost his memories, and forgotten all that he held dear.

"Why was I placed here? What is my purpose? What is my reason?" questions he asked himself, day in, day out.

When, he found a light, a shining light. A queen to serve, a guild to depend on, and a lovely companion.

A companion in which he could call "home".

But, like him, everyone around him had lost their memories. Despite this, they continued to fight and journey side by side. Even without their memories, they knew, intrinsically, that they could rely on each other.

But as each day passed, everyone knew, that these days would come to an end.

The memories would return, and when they returned, would they be the same person as they were now?

Knowing this, they continued on, making the most of it.

The knight, suddenly full of purpose, was called an honest, noble knight.

But the knight was conflicted... for inside of him, was a selfishness. He wished that no one's memories would return, so that he could keep living in these peaceful days.

But, alas.

He holds his convictions in his heart, and he will continue on with his head held high.

For he knows a selfish request such as his, could never be true.
