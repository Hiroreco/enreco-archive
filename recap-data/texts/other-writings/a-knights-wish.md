<!-- title: A Knight's Wish -->

Once upon a time,

There was a knight.

He had nothing, but then, this is truly, where his story began.

In the nothingness, he had found, something.

A shining light, his "pearl".

The knight, unwavering in his loyalty, did not want to ever appear "selfish" for he was afraid...

Afraid that if he were to show such an ugly, terrifying desire, that those around him, would leave him.

So he kept those feelings.

Every day, the knight helped the citizens of Libestal, always giving, never asking, never wanting.

If this "selflessness" would give him companionship, then he believed, that was all he needed.

But, but...

This "pearl" changed something within him.

He could feel these desires, festering, a burning, ugly feeling.

He wanted her to stay.

Even though he knew that it would be selfish, that when she regained her memories, that she would no longer be his.

She would no longer be the person she was.

The one that remembered him.

The one that loved him wholly.

So he let her go.

But deep down, he wished, and he desired...

That one day, the Pearl would remember. and that she would come to him.

And he would be whole again.

But he knows, that such a tale is only wishful thinking.

He knows now, that by allowing things to happen, by never wanting, he would never truly have his heart's desire.

But rather, be forced to live in a world being built around him. Without him.

So, he pens this story, in hopes that one day, it will be read.

And the pearl will remember.

And she will want.

And she will wish.

Just as he does.

So that he may live in this happy memory.

For a little while longer.
