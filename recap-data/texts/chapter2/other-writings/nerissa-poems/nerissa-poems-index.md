<!-- title: Nerissa's Poems -->

<!-- description -->

Shown on the sixth day of Chapter 2, these poems reflect Nerissa’s emotions and stream of thought following the events of the fifth day—her frustration, her love, and her longing for the scarlet knight she held so near and dear.

Three of the poems were excerpts from existing works, while one, _Maven in Blue_, was Nerissa’s own creation.
