<!-- title: letter -->

Dear Shiori of the Nyavellas,

Thank you for taking your time to write your kind letter.

I have not gotten a chance to eat your potato salad yet but it smells lovely.

Whenever you need assistance, please do not be afraid to call.

I look forward to the next time we meet.

Gonathon with a G.
