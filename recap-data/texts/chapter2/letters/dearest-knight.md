<!-- title: Dearest Knight -->

Dearest Lady Bloodflame,

I hath noticed that you hath removeth thine portrait from our mutual portrait wall of your house.

Hath I angered you, dear knight?

Or perhaps... am I... overthinking it?

Sincerely,
Lady Nerissa Juliet

Nerissa’s worried, heartfelt letter to Elizabeth, written on Day 5 of Chapter 2, came after she discovered that the scarlet knight had taken down the portrait they’d hung side by side. Was something wrong? Did Elizabeth hate her? Nerissa needed to know.
