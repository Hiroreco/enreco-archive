<!-- title: My confession -->

Dearest Immerkind,

I hope this letter reaches you well.

I am writing to you for none other reason that to express these inexplicible emotions that are swirling inside of me.....like a storm.

Mother always told me that maybe one day I would find my special somebody....

but she was gone before she could explain what that I meant...

I don't understand what these emotions truly are... but you are special to me.

There is something about you...

I... care for you...

As a token of my affection, please do accept this humble present from this humble peasant.

Oh could this be the buds of love?...

Would you care to join me on such a adventure...?

An adventure of life

An adventure of love

An adventure of something new..?

I eagerly anticipate our next meeting...

Signed with passion,
Peasant THE BAE

In the end, her confession was met with rejection.
