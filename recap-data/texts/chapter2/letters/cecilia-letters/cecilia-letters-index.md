<!-- title: Immerkind's Letters-->

### Description

As a display of her love and devotion, throughout the second chapter, Immerkind wrote a series of letters to Princess Iphania, secretly slipping them onto the maiden’s bedside while she slept.

Whether this unsettling gesture was truly romantic—or if the princess ever read any of the letters—remains open to debate.
