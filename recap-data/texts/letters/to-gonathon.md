<!-- title: To Gonathon-->

Thank you for spending time with me.

I had fun while it lasted.

I hope you find your memories!

I may not be as good to you the next time we meet, and I'm sorry if that's the case.

I was fond of you if that's any consolation.

I really did think you I have quite the pure and gentle heart.

I think you need to find yourself first before starting anything with anyone.

You should believe in yourself.

Do not sacrifice too much of yourself now.

Even if it's by the queen's orders, I think it would be much better for everyone if you could stand up for yourself.

I was hoping to impart to you one last gift, but as per your wishes I I will not give the memory pearl.

Instead, thank you and sorry for taking this burden of memory from me.

Even if it is temporary (unless I delete the memory file I suppose), thank you for the time we spent together.

Goodbye.
