<!-- title: Your Promise-->

Dearest Gonathon,

Thank you for making this purchase.

I'm sorry if it may have been an expensive one, but memories are precious after all.

Mine most of all due to my job and role.

Behind your tree I have placed a white cotton wool block.

Please remove that and keep the items in that chest.

I'm sure someone will be happy to receive them when you are ready to truly give yourself.

I'm sure whomever you end up with will be happy with you.

You are a good soul.

For now, fare thee well.
