Dear Juliet,

You spoke of feeling down. If I played any part in that shadow, 
I offer my deepest apology. A good knight should never be the cause 
of a maiden's sorrow.
Though you may have forgotten what came before, please know that in the quiet
moments between this world, and the previous, you have remained a cherished memory.
I hope I become an even better knight day by day worthy of what I cherish.

From Romeo

P.S.
Next time instead of gambling- spar me.
