<!-- title: Dearest Consort -->

Dearest Consort Eternal...

I hope you are doing well...it seems like it's been forever since I last saw you...but...I know this cannot continue...

We have gone through many trials and challenges together...but...I feel with the recent happenings I have been enlightened...

As big as my love is for you...I feel that this cannot continue the way it is...

After thinking over it...I have decided to leave on a journey to repent...a journey...or recollection... a journey...for a revelation...

I have done good...but I also think I have done bad...

It is a journey of self-reflection and discovery...please do not worry...I will always hold our time dear to my heart...

I shall be departing after the victory banquet...I hope that I can see you one last time before my journey...

I know it is selfish of me to ask...but....if...you still feel the same after my return...

would you still be...uwu
