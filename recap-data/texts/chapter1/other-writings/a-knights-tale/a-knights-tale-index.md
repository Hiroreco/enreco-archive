### Description

Written by the knight himself on Day 6, *A Knight’s Tale* conveyed Gonathon’s reflections on his journey so far—his convictions, his revelations—after learning that his beloved wife, his Pearl, Jyan Watson, had forgotten him upon regaining her memories.

Its follow-up, *A Knight’s Wish*, written on the final day, expressed his deepest longing and faint hope that his Pearl might one day remember who he was.
