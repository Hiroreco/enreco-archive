We find ourselves in a white, emply space. 

It's so vast that very concept of distance seems to lose meaning. 

In the midst of that space, we see an antique desk and a leather chair.

And on that chair sits a girl sipping tea. 

Tick, tock, tick, tock...

We hear a clock, but from where?

Tick, tock, tick, tock...

As more and more clocks join the chorus, the girl closes her eyes.


"Wait, what was I...?"

The girl stands on the roadside, looking dazed as though she just woke up from a dream.

The picture in her hand soon jogs her memory, however.

The owner is expecting a call from her soon, she'll need to be quick.

This detective has a reputation to uphold, after all.

"Don't worry, little guy! I'll find you, I promise!"
