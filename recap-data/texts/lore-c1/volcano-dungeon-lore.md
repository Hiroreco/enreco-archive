When I found out about them, it changed my life forever.

They just felt so "right" for me, you know?

I bet it was fate!

I think about them all the time. Maybe there's one in this town too...?

...Whoa, there is!

Okay, I'm checking out this fast food place right now!

Mmmmm! Now this is what I'm talking about.

It's a shame they didn't have fast food back in the age of legends, because a good hamburger would've motivated me to fight even harder.

But now, we've got this whole range of burgers to choose from!

How cool is that?

Man, that burger was perfect.

Juicy meat, crispy veggies, fluffy buns....

It's exactly what I wanted.

I wasn't expecting that from a small place in some back alley, but you know what?

This is now my new favorite restaurant!
