I leave this for the heroes who will one day visit this place. May it serve you well.

Each chamber past has offered you a rhyme
Prevealing secrets where you've gone before
There's one last thing
to find ere out you climb

And therefore I present to you one more:
The haunting grounds
of creatures of the night
Within its depths you'll find a hidden light
