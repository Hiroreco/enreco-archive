In ages long past, there was a land of untold prosperity.
Its technology and culture stood at the pinnacle of civilization.
But then, catastrophe struck, and what had taken a thousand years to build was erased in a single night.

With the land sunk to the depths of the ocean, one might think this was the end.
Yet where one people had been wiped out, another took its place, and lived a new, happy, and peaceful life.
"Uuugh! This place is so boring!"

Perhaps even a bit too peaceful.

"I'm getting out of here, you'll see!"

Day after day, the little girl planned her great escape.

There was no nice way to put it: the girl was sick of the underwater kingdom, and she tried constantly to leave it behind.

"Nooo, they got me again..."

Yet with the guard being every watchful, this was anything but easy. She'd probably been caught a hundred times by now. Even so, giving up was the last thing on her mind. Each failure instead served as inspiration for a new attempt.

"Am I just going about this the wrong way? Yeah! I know what I'll do next!"

And so, another day of planning began.
