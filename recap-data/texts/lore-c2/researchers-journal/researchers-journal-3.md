<!-- title: Researcher's Journal #3 -->

17th day of Midautumn, 1006

At least a quarter of Libestal has been lost to the Stains. Every day, a new village falls; every week, a new city. The growing corruption has left a lifeless wasteland in its wake. If this is not the Ruination, I know not what is.

The Headmistress has once again denied my request for more funding. She tells me to drop the Stain research and focus on something else. But I cannot. This is too important.

More varieties of Stain have been discovered. Explosive ones, phantasmal ones... even rumors of mighty ones, that act like leaders. It's not just the Stains, either. My field researchers bring me reports of flooding, landslides, and upheavals in the Fallen Lands.

There is so much work to be done. But who knows if I will even have field researchers this time next week?
