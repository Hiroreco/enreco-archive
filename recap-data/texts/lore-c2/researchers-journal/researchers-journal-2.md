<!-- title: Researcher's Journal #2 -->

25th day of Late Summer, 1006

I finished compiling my report: 32 pages of detailed observations of the Stains and citations from the Book of Prophecies, cross-referenced with centuries of scholarly analysis.

But when I presented it to the Headmistress, she took only a few moments to review it before telling me to rethink my conclusions.

It's disappointing, but understandable. Claims about the Ruination must be made with care. And if the Headmistress says I am mistaken, then so it must be.

Perhaps I am missing something. I must return to my research.
