<!-- title: Researcher's Journal #5 -->

26th day of Midspring, 1007

There's not enough room in this office for all the documents. How did the old Headmistress do it? I'll have to get some students in here tomorrow to sort things out.

I'm starting to regret promoting that nuisance to senior researcher. I've reassigned his assistants, for his own good. Maybe he'll finally get his nose out of those geological maps and start helping with the interpretation work.

I don't know where he gets these ideas from. We had a couple tremors last week, but so what? The Lykeion will weather any calamity. The Book of Prophecies is clear on the matter, and it's never been wrong before. So it must be.
