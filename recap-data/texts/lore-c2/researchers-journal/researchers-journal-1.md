<!-- title: Researcher's Journal #1 -->

3rd day of Early Summer, 1006

We've decided to call the shadow creatures "Stains." They were first observed in the Sidero region, but their spread has been rapid and relentless.

These past weeks, I have been leading the research team investigating this new threat. Here's what we know so far:

- They are very aggressive and will attack on sight.
- Individuals lack higher intelligence, being incapable of communication or complex behavioral patterns.
- Despite this, they seem to act with coordination as a group, expanding their territory methodically.
- Wherever they go, corruption follows, a shadowy blight on the land that is toxic to living things.
- They come in multiple forms, three of which have been observed so far: a round slime-like one, a quadrupedal beast-like one, and a winged bat-like one.

Many of the signs align with the prophecy of the Ruination, the destined end of our world. However, more research is required before any conclusions can be made.

But if it's true, and this is indeed the start of the Ruination, then our world will end within a generation. I must compile my findings and bring them to the Headmistress at once.
