<!-- title: Song of Ruin -->

It started quite simple, a matter of greed.
He did all the rest, I just planted the seed.
A humble girl's vanity let me in next.
She brought down the queen with a stab to the chest.

Then one foolish man who let fear rule his mind
Set fire to his home and left nothing behind.
A traveling merchant, so simple a guise
Who stirred the emotions that clouded their eyes.

It doesn't take much for my essence to hide.
A trinket, a knick-knack-I'll burrow inside.
Yet through all their suffering, one thing's for sure:
They brought this upon themselvesâ€”Nothing stays pure.
