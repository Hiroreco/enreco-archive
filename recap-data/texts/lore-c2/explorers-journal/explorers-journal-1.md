15th day of Midspring, 1006

I dunno what the Chief's on about this time. Folks have searched these cliffs for centuries, trying to find the hidden power the prophecy spoke of, and all they found was iron and coal.

But now, some shady traveling merchant has sold him a dowsing rod, and he swears it'll take us straight to the buried treasure. Psh, sure. If that thing works, I'll eat my boot.

He's dead set on it, though. "The prophecy says it's down there, and so it must be!"

He even hired a knight this time, "to protect our discovery." She looks more competent than a common sellsword, at least. Something of the strong, silent type. Don't think I've heard a word out of her since we met.
