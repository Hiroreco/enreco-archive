25th day of Midspring, 1006

It happened today. The Chief found the spot. The dowsing rod lurched sideways like it was pulled by a string, and we both knew.

We swung our pickaxes for hours, and my back feels like it's on fire. But it's all right. I know you're watching me. I know this is what you would have wanted.

We'll find it. We'll find what's buried here. And we'll show everyone who doubted us that they were wrong.

I can hardly wait.
