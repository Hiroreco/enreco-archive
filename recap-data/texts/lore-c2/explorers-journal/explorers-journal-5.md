??? day of ???

How many days have I been up here? Everything's been a blur since our pickaxes broke through and unleashed... whatever it is.

I can't see the Chief. I hope he got away. He was gullible, and impulsive, but he doesn't deserve this. That knight had the right idea, leaving when she did. If only I'd followed.

This place is crawling with shadow creatures now. I thought I'd hide here until they moved on, but instead, their numbers keep growing. There's nowhere for me to go anymore.

The one in my dreams... that wasn't you, was it? It used you, like it used me. Are you still watching? Is this my penance?

Whatever we set free, there's no stopping it now. The shadows gurgle forth like water from a spring. It's spreading, and spreading, with no end in sight. Let all the world beware.
