<!-- title: The Library -->

The Library Between Worlds is an archive of lore from across the multiverse. It moves freely through time and space, opening its doors wherever and whenever it pleases.

The origins of the Library are shrouded in mystery. Perhaps one of the countless tomes within it holds the answer... or perhaps not.

Its current caretaker is the librarian Fia, but this was not always the case. Who was the librarian before her, if there was one? Yet another mystery.

For some reason, only those chosen by the Library are able to enter or even perceive it. Nor can the librarian leave, for her very essence is bound to the Library.

Wanderers who pass through the Library can record their memories to add to the collection. What might your story inspire in those who come after?
