<!-- title: Prelude of Ruin -->

So foolish, so sure that your battle is won.
You think that this world is the first I've undone?
I've faced greater heroes and far greater odds,
But never once faltered pursuing my cause.

A million worlds ended before you drew breath.
For I am oblivion, ruin, and death.
By all means, come fight me, if you're so inclined.
We'll see if you die by your friends' hands or mine.
