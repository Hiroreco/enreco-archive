<!-- title: Libestal Ficta -->

A noble kingdom, besieged by monsters of shadowâ€”but it was all a lie. In truth, the entire world was an illusion, created as a prison to contain an entity of untold malice.

The lynchpin of this world was the false Stain King, and with its defeat, the entity trapped inside was unleashed. Now, with its captive gone and its core destroyed, the illusory world is left to disintegrate back into the void.
