1st day of Late Winter, 1013

Anax, do you remember the honey cakes mom used to make? They were dense, and brittle, and smelled like the meadows in full bloom.

I don't know how you did it, but you could always tell when mom was making them, even from high above the treetops. Was it the color of the smoke? Or the honey stains on her apron? Either way, when I heard your happy chirp, I knew we had a treat waiting for us.

Once we landed, I'd plop down on that old stump, and mom would hand me two cakes, one for me and one for you. When I was little, your big, sharp beak used to scare me, and mom would have to hold my hand to feed you. But you never scratched me, not even once. You were always so gentle.

Well, I made some honey cakes. Half the flour in the storeroom was moldy, but I scooped out the good bits, and I found a beehive up a tree. They're not as good as mom's, but they still taste like home.

I made them. Your favorite. So why aren't you eating?
