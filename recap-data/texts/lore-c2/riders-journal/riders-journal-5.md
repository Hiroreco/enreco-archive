22nd day of Late Winter, 1014

The guardsmen told me only a fool would leave the safety of the capital. If I was sensible, I would have listened.

Well, here I am.

I hope you're not too lonely here, Anax. I wish I could visit more often, but this is all Stain territory now. The knights have fallen back to the Grey Marsh, but even that won't hold for long.

I've been doing all right, given the circumstances. They found me an attic room to stay in. Three other families are living in the same house. No one's comfortable, no one's happy, but we're all alive. Better than the people the house used to belong to.

Everything's so crowded in the capital. I miss our old village, before it got overrun with Stains, before all of this. The air was clearer, and the sky felt so open. Nowadays, the sky feels like it's closing me in.

They say the last gryphon fell in battle a few weeks ago. Another prophecy come true, I guess. Though if you were here, I know you'd still be out there, fighting beak and talon.

I miss you, Anax. It's been a year, and I still miss you every day. I don't know if I'll be able to visit next year. If I can't, just know I love you.
Take care up there.
