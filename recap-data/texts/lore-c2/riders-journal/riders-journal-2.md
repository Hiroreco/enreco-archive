13th day of Late Autumn, 1012

I can't believe the conditions here. No one's shoveled out the stables in weeks, and the stench is enough to make you faint. I spent the whole morning in there, and barely cleared enough room for Anax to sleep in.

Are these really the skymasters who bred steeds for the greatest knights in the kingdom? I ask them for help, and they just shrug. "What's the point?" they say. "The prophecy says these creatures are all doomed. So it must be."

Even the apothecary seemed disinterested, but at least he let me into the medicine storeroom. I'll have a look around tomorrow, and see what I can find.
