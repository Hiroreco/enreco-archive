11th day of Late Autumn, 1012

We made it, Anax. The Aerie. Oh, how I wish you could see this. It's so beautiful. A good sight better than that Stain-infested village we left behind.

The skymasters have raised a hundred generations of gryphons here. They'll know how to help you, I'm sure of it. For now, you just rest your old wings. We'll find you a warm stable with soft hay and all the apples you could want.

Once you're better, we'll head to the capital. Everyone says it's the safest place. There's no telling how much longer the knights can hold the River Wall, and once it falls, not even the Aerie will be safe.
