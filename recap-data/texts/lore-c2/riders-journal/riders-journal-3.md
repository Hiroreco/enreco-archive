19th day of Early Winter, 1013

Aithon's still scratched up from the fight, but that didn't stop him from biting me again today. Luckily, the pads I found in the skymasters' storeroom worked like a charm, even if they were a size too big. Now that the splinter's out of his talon, maybe he'll behave.

Chelidon's fever's finally gone down, but she's still weak. Meanwhile, Talos's fur and feathers are a tangled, matted mess, and I don't know when I'll have time to groom him.

We're running out of medicine, and I haven't seen the apothecary in days. In fact, a lot of the skymasters seem to have quietly left. We're in for a hard winter, and I don't know how I'm going to take care of all these gryphons alone.

As for Anax... he's hanging in there. I was worried he got hurt fighting Aithon, but he's a tough old bird. Must have been all those years on the front lines with mom. His condition's not getting any better, though, and I'm running out of ideas.
