## Chapter 1: Kingdom of Libestal

### Summoned, as Heroes

Nineteen heroes awoke in a blinding white box, confused and disoriented. One moment, they were going about their ordinary lives—the next, they found themselves surrounded by strangers just as bewildered as they were. More puzzling still, none of them could remember anything: not their names, not their pasts—nothing.

Then came another strange twist. The group was transported to a castle—specifically, the royal castle of the Kingdom of Libestal. There, the _King_—who claimed responsibility for their summoning—declared them the prophesied heroes destined to save the kingdom from the encroaching threat of the Stains.

Though the situation was bizarre, the heroes banded together. With their newfound powers, known as _Revelation_, they managed to temporarily halt the advance of the Stain King.

And so, donning their Libestal cloaks, they took their first steps on an enigmatic journey.

### Guilds and Dungeons

Nineteen individuals, each with their own quirks and personalities… it was a lot. Naturally, they were divided into smaller groups—_guilds_—to make collaboration more manageable. There were four guilds in total, each embodying a unique philosophy:

- **Jade Sword** – A beacon of righteousness and loyalty, where great threats are faced with even greater courage.
- **Cerulean Cup** – A sanctum of healing, where empathy and devotion flourish.
- **Amber Coin** – A haven for glory-seekers and visionaries, where closest allies can become fiercest rivals.
- **Scarlet Wand** – A refuge for the curious, where knowledge and creativity are prized above all.

Within these guilds, unfamiliar faces became trusted companions.

As they explored the kingdom, the heroes were assigned various tasks—or _quests_—to help them grow accustomed to life in Libestal. From slaying Stains and gathering resources to making an absurd amount of potato salad that somehow tanked the economy, these quests kept them busy and earned them coin.

But the most important quests, assigned by either the King or the Guildmasters, revolved around conquering _dungeons_. Each dungeon had its own unique theme and challenges, pushing the heroes to their limits—and strengthening their bonds. Upon completing each conquest, the heroes were rewarded not just with gold, but with something far more precious: a fragment of their lost memories. Specifically, a memory of one of their fellow companions.

There were five dungeons in total, each tied to a different hero:

- **The Underworld Dungeon** – A dark and foreboding realm tied to death itself, holding the memories of the Grim Reaper’s apprentice, _Mori Calliope_.
- **The Ocean Temple Dungeon** – An underwater labyrinth echoing the grandeur of Atlantis, revealing the identity of _Gawr Gura_, the mischievous Princess of the Deep.
- **The Eldritch Horror Dungeon** – A haunting place steeped in ancient whispers and unknowable dread, tied to the priestess of the Ancient Ones, _Ninomae Ina’nis_.
- **The Volcanic Dungeon** – A blazing inferno of fire and rebirth, housing the memories of _Takanashi Kiara_, the undying Phoenix.
- **The Ancient Sewer Dungeon** – Unassuming in appearance but deeply significant. Within this grimy maze lay the memories of someone very special—a time-traveling detective, the brilliant _Amelia Watson_.

As these memories returned, so too did the heroes’ perceptions of one another. The companions they had grown to trust turned out to be legends—each one mighty in her own right.

### Capitalism and Bonds

Of course, all of that barely scratched the surface of what went on in this kingdom. Our heroes, despite their supposed status as saviors (a title only a few truly lived up to), were... eccentric, to say the least. So much so that even the King himself might have questioned his decision on summoning them.

One of them plotted a coup against the monarchy on day one. Another repeatedly mispronounced the kingdom's name as "Lesbians" for no reason other than, well, nothing at all.

One opened a business—FaunaMart—selling everyday goods at outrageous prices, including the highly sought-after meat and, more controversially, lottery tickets. Another opened a rival shop, NanaEleven, equally predatory. Both enterprises ran elaborate scams.

One hero got addicted to gambling—those same lottery tickets—and that kicked off everything: confrontations, lawsuits, public trials, you name it.

There were battles between two fake queens. A tavern keeper who not only served food but also ran a booming side business in processing divorces—because, apparently, there was no shortage of them.

From adopting strangers as their moms, to proposing marriages with seeds and eggs as dowries, to a fiery knight who kept accusing a certain woman of witchcraft—who in turn relished every accusation.

Yet beneath all that madness, a more grounded, heartfelt story unfolded—a bond between a humble knight and his precious pearl. A love story marked by trials, sweetness, sorrow, and ultimately, perseverance. Against all odds, they made it through.

Things were vibrant and full of life—the heroes were truly enjoying themselves.

### The Battle Against the Corruption

As the final days approached, the kingdom’s once cheerful and vibrant air took a dark turn. Corruption began to spread—an insidious force that twisted the minds of its victims and left the land in crisis. At the heart of it was the self-proclaimed Stain Princess, Koseki Bijou, the first to fall.

The infection spread quickly, overtaking more and more, threatening to consume everything. But even as despair loomed, the heroes stood firm. With hearts full of determination, they gave everything they had to save their corrupted friends. They believed—no matter how far gone someone seemed—there was always a chance to _Start Again_.

The remaining heroes rallied together, determined to find a way to cleanse the corruption that had taken hold of their former comrades. Refusing to give up on those they once fought beside, they poured their efforts into uncovering a cure—one that could reach through the darkness and pull their friends back.

Through resourcefulness, wit, and a fair share of chaos, they devised a clever plan: to trick the corrupted into using the cure themselves. A gamble, to be sure—but one that paid off. And just like that, one by one, the shadows began to fade.

Even Bijou, who had fallen deep into the clutches of corruption, was saved.

Their bonds, once frayed, were mended.

Their hope, once dimmed, now shone brighter than ever.

And for a moment, the world felt whole again.

### Plot Twist and The Captive

The Kingdom of Libestal, despite its regal exterior, held secrets—secrets that the more perceptive heroes began to uncover. Whispers and doubts about the King began to spread. Theories circulated: Was he truly the benevolent ruler he claimed to be?

With the corruption finally quelled, the heroes prepared for one last battle—to destroy the Stain King once and for all. This time, they would not merely delay him but defeat him for good. And they did. Their Revelations aligned, their bonds stronger than ever, they brought him down. The kingdom rejoiced. Peace, at last... or so they believed.

But then came the betrayal.

The King revealed his true intentions. By defeating the Stain King, the heroes had unknowingly broken the chains that bound him. The title of "King" was just a mask. What stood before them now was something far worse: The Captive. A being beyond comprehension, free at last, with one goal—to enact what it would call its _vengeance._

Shock. Anger. Confusion. Betrayal. All these emotions surged through the heroes. But there was no time to dwell. They raised their weapons one final time and charged at the great evil. Yet it was not enough. The Captive was too strong.

Just as the end seemed inevitable, a voice called out—a mysterious guide urging them to jump into a portal. With no other choice, they did.

And so ended the first chapter of their enigmatic journey.
