## Chapter 2: The Chains of Fate

### New Beginnings, Greater Responsibilities

After leaping into a portal to escape the Captive’s grasp—guided only by a mysterious voice—the heroes found themselves adrift in time and space, their sense of reality slipping away. When they finally opened their eyes, they were in yet another unfamiliar place, greeted by yet another unfamiliar face.

That face belonged to Fia—a talking, cat-like doll who, in no uncertain terms, had saved their lives. She brought them to a place known as the Library and explained the truth of their situation: the kingdom of Libestal, where their previous journey had taken place, was never real.

It was an illusion—one created to contain the being the heroes had called their King. By defeating the Stain King, they had unwittingly destroyed the vessel keeping this entity imprisoned. And in doing so, they had freed his true form—**the Outsider** (previously known as the Captive)—a force of hatred and ruin now set to obliterate the universe itself.

But not all hope was lost. Fia had pulled them back—back through time—to an older, real version of Libestal. Here, in the past, there was still a chance. A narrow, fading hope to stop the Outsider before he could ever come into being. The heroes—no, the **Shining Stars**—would be the ones to change fate.

However, there was one problem.

Time travel comes at a cost. Both the heroes and Fia had lost pieces of their memories—crucial pieces that might hold the key to stopping the Outsider. Just like before, they'd need to recover them—piece by piece—through trials ahead.

Fia wasn't alone in placing hope in the Shining Stars. Iphania, Princess of this older Libestal, ruled over the last sanctuary of a world being slowly devoured by Stains, by corruption, by the **Ruination**. When the heroes appeared before her, she believed them to be divine—fallen stars sent to defy destiny. She spoke of the Book of Prophecies, which foretold the world's end. But Iphania refused to surrender to fate, and the arrival of the heroes seemed proof that perhaps, just perhaps, the future could still be rewritten.

And so began a new journey. In a new kingdom. With new stakes.

To save the world.
To save the universe.
To break the chains of fate.

### Occupation and Memories

Even heroes have to eat.

With the kingdom barely sustaining its refugees, the heroes needed more than just noble intentions—they needed a source of income. Unlike their previous journey, there were no guilds here. Instead, each hero selected a profession—jobs critical to both survival and progress. There were four in total:

- **The Smith** – Forged upgrade stones used to enhance Revelation weapons.
- **The Jeweler** – Crafted charms that bolstered health and defense.
- **The Chef** – Cooked meals granting powerful buffs for their adventures.
- **The Supplier** – Enchanted tools to boost resource-gathering efficiency.

![Charm making process from a Jeweler](/images-opt/chrecap-1-charm.webp)

Each role played an important part in the group’s advancement. Cooperation was essential. The chefs provided food for all. The smiths strengthened weapons others couldn’t. The suppliers fueled the craftsmen. And though it was less about goodwill and more about charging each other for services rendered, the system worked—barely.

The heroes needed every advantage they could get. New lands meant harder battles, and the dungeons—or rather, _Star Sites_—grew more dangerous with each step forward. But just like before, within those treacherous places lay fragments of what they’d lost: their memories.

Each Star Site centered on a specific hero, unlocking recollections of who they were:

- **Star Site: Elpis** – A realm that demanded unity and teamwork, restoring the memories of the embodiment of Hope, _IRyS_.
- **Star Site: Chronos** – Governed by the relentless passage of time, its trials restored the memories of the _Warden of Time_, _Ouro Kronii_.
- **Star Site: Chaos** – A place of madness and mischief, more like a fever dream than a dungeon, holding the memories of Chaos herself, _Hakos Baelz_.

The dungeons this time were far more intricate than before. Each one was a labyrinth of puzzles, traps, and trials—but above all, they demanded one thing above everything else: teamwork. No lone hero could tackle them alone. Even if someone possessed the skill to survive on their own, the challenges were designed to test not just strength or wits, but trust, timing, and synergy.

Every switch required coordination. Every battle demanded support. Every step forward was a step together.

These weren’t just dungeons—they were trials of unity.

It was also required for the heroes to submit daily diary entries to the Library—records of their thoughts, experiences, and emotions. These entries served a critical purpose: to archive their memories. In the event they ever lost them again, the Library would act as a safeguard, preserving fragments of their identities, relationships, and choices. Every joy, every sorrow, every battle and bond—they were all written down, page by page, day by day.

Beyond the main Star Sites, the heroes also undertook smaller dungeons and side missions that unveiled hidden truths. Not only did they recover the memories of their companions—they slowly began to restore Fia’s fragmented past as well.

And with those memories came revelations about the true nature of the Outsider—how his existence was deeply intertwined with another mysterious figure: the Outlander.

### The Nameless Swordsman

Before the heroes arrived in this kingdom, there was one who had already taken up the burden of saving the world—offering his blade in service to a doomed cause. A mysterious swordsman, known only as **the Outlander**, stood alone. Though nameless, he was far from forgotten—especially by the Princess, who held great affection for him, and he, in turn, for her. He was powerful, resolute, and driven by the will to destroy the Curse and shatter the Heart of Ruin. But that very determination sealed his fate—and everyone else’s.

![The heroes meeting the Outlander for the first time](/images-opt/outlander-meet.webp)

As Fia recovered the last fragments of her memory, the Outlander’s true identity was revealed: **The Watcher**, a member of the Collective, whose divine purpose was to observe the fates of worlds without interference. He had seen countless tragedies unfold—including Libestal’s—and never lifted a finger. But something changed the day he met Princess Iphania. A girl with a fire in her heart, who refused to surrender to fate, who stood tall when all others had fallen. Her courage stirred something long dormant within the Watcher.

For the first time, he broke his oath. He intervened.

He tried to save the world.

But defying a higher being came with a price. As punishment, he was imprisoned within a fabricated kingdom—a false Libestal designed to contain him for eternity. Time passed. Pain festered. Despair turned to rage. That rage took shape when the heroes unknowingly freed him by destroying the vessel of the Stain King, releasing the full wrath of the Outsider.

To prevent such devastation from ever happening again, Fia placed their hopes in the heroes. If they could finish what the Outlander started—defeat the Curse and destroy the Heart of Ruin—the Watcher’s defiance would never come to light. The Outsider would never be born. The universe could be saved.

Though the end of the world loomed just seven days away, those seven days were more than enough for the heroes to do what they did best—stir things up.

### Your Usual Shenanigans, Tenfold

With four fewer heroes on this second journey—those lost to tax evasion and alleged trident theft—you’d think things would be calmer. Perhaps even quieter.

Oh, how wrong that assumption was.

Let’s sample just a few days to illustrate the magnitude of the madness:

- **Day 1**: Jobs were chosen. Alliances formed. A “Dawg Pack” was established. Some remembered their pasts, others didn’t. Former lovers were now siblings. A green lady grew dangerously obsessed with the Princess. A tavern owner’s business suffered repeated sabotage.
- **Day 2**: Chaos incarnate, the hot pink menace, a classist, brocon, and alcoholic pink, began causing relationship destruction wherever she went. An embarrassing fumbling performance of a Scarlet Knight in front of her crush.
- **Day 3**: Incest.
- **Day 7**: "We defeated the Curse!" — immediately followed by a gender reveal party, complete with spontaneous birth (of gas).

And that only scratched the surface... _Sigh_.

![It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's gas!](/images-opt/chrecap-1-gas.webp)

However, beneath the mind-melting absurdity were moments of surprising sincerity. Genuine stories of personal growth, love, and heartbreak. A determined, fluffy café owner who held tight to her dream of connecting people through food. The steady development of a bond between the aforementioned fumbling Scarlet Knight and a blue maiden. A complicated romance between a humble knight and a witch—a love that began as manipulation, only for the witch to be moved by his kindness. But love, as always, was cruel. In the end, their paths had to diverge.

Weird, wonderful, emotional—the journey was all of it. Even without the full ensemble from the first tale, the world remained alive, chaotic, heartfelt... and deeply unforgettable.

### The Crimson-Colored Banquet

Through sheer will, determination, and the strength of their unbreakable bonds, the heroes banded together to defeat the Curse once and for all. The Ruination was stopped. The world was saved. More importantly, a cruel fate had been averted—one that would have given birth to a great evil capable of consuming the entire universe. The Princess was overjoyed. Fia was elated. The Outlander's burden was finally lifted, and the kingdom basked in the light of celebration.

At long last, everyone could breathe a sigh of relief and savor a rare, well-earned moment of peace.

A grand banquet awaited—the Victory Banquet—held in honor of the Shining Stars, the saviors of the world.

...

But before the first glass could be raised, before a single bite of the celebratory feast was taken, a blood-curdling scream pierced through the joyous atmosphere. The heroes and the Outlander rushed toward the source—only to find the Princess lying lifeless on the ground. Looming over her, the Curse, barely clinging to existence after its defeat, had struck one final, devastating blow.

And then, a ripple tore through the space around them.

A voice—cryptic, cold, and godlike—echoed across the room. A being beyond comprehension, cloaked in divinity and judgment, spoke with grim finality. It condemned the heroes and the Outlander alike, declaring their sin: the audacity to defy fate itself.

![Iphania's death and the price for defying fate](/images-opt/chrecap-1-banquet.webp)

Just as divine punishment was about to be dealt, Fia intervened. In a desperate act, she saved the heroes from the impending doom. No one had foreseen such a cruel twist. No one wanted to believe what had just happened. But even in the face of heartbreak and despair, the heroes still clung to hope.

This couldn't be the end—not yet.

As long as they remained together, there was still a chance. No matter how insurmountable the odds, they believed they could overcome anything. As long as they were united...

Though, perhaps even that was wishful thinking.

### The Start of a Fiery Rebellion

Fia revealed the truth at last.

She was Iphania—the Princess of Libestal. When the Curse struck her down, her soul became bound to her plush doll, and her consciousness drifted across time and space until she awoke in the Library, assuming the role of its Librarian.

Perhaps the past couldn't be changed. Perhaps fate truly was immutable. But even so, she wasn’t ready to give up. If they couldn’t alter the past, then they would try to shape the future—a future that teetered on the brink of total annihilation.

She asked for their help once more. And, without hesitation, the heroes answered. They were heroes, after all. If the world needed saving, they would rise to the call—no matter how many times it asked.

![The heroes lend their hands to Fia](/images-opt/chrecap-1-helpfia.webp)

...Except, not all of them stepped forward.

Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori remained behind—shrouded in shadow.

They refused.

Tired of being ordered, tired of playing roles dictated by others, they declared rebellion. Whether cursed or possessed was unclear, but one thing was certain—the fire of defiance now burned in their hearts, "nothing stays pure" after all. They would forge their own path. Do things _their_ way.

At the head of it all stood Shiori Nyavella.

Two-toned hair flowing, golden eyes gleaming with ancient knowledge, she stood like someone who knew everything—who had seen everything. Not just her own story, but everyone’s. The scripts. The endings. The truths no one else dared acknowledge.

With her arms outstretched and her voice steady, she asked the remaining heroes just one question:

!["Who's with us?"](/images-opt/chrecap-1-shiori.webp)

And thus marked the end of Chapter Two of this enigmatic journey.
