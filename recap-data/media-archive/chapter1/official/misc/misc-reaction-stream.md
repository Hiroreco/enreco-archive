### Description

Held on **November 16th, 2024**, this recap show took place two months after the conclusion of Chapter 1. Calli, Bijou, and Gonathon gathered to react to and relive some of the most memorable and hilarious moments from the first chapter.

At the end of the stream, an exciting announcement was made—the production of **Chapter 2**, titled _“The Chains of Fate.”_
