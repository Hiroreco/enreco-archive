### Description

Amelia Watson’s memories were recovered after the conquest of the Ancient Sewers Dungeon, which took place on the fifth day of the first chapter.

A detective always chasing the next big case, yet every mystery she encountered turned out to be trivial drama at best. She longed for something grand—the case of the century! But when she finally believed she had found it while investigating four mysterious figures, she discovered that they were not villains or myths, but simply kindhearted people.

Nonetheless, the revelation left her content. For big or small, it was the thrill of uncovering the truth that brought her joy. After all, she was _the_ number one detective.
