### Description

The official theme song for Chapter 1, featuring Calli, Ina, IRyS, and Elizabeth, released on August 31st, 2024 — the day before the official beginning of this enigmatic journey.

The song carries a fun, upbeat vibe — an energetic, self-affirming anthem that sets the stage for this incredible journey. Throughout the song, the general theme resembles a declaration of unwavering resolve and renewed confidence, both literal (for the characters who lost their memories) and metaphorical (for facing any new challenge in life or a new creative venture).

It shows that even after getting lost, they can find their way, unite, and rise stronger than before. Hence, **"START AGAIN."**
