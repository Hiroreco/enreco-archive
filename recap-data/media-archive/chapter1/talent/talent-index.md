### Description

During the first chapter, at the start of each day while waiting to "wake up," Lady Bloodflame would experience flashes of moments that had transpired in the days before.

From her promise to Mococo on the first day to her mental breakdown after Nerissa declared she hated the red knight, these flashes, illustrated through rough, simple, yet captivating sketches, captured the moments that lingered in the scarlet knight’s mind. They shaped her character and offered the voices watching her journey a deeper glimpse into her psyche and thoughts.
