### Description

Takanashi Kiara’s memories were recovered after the conquest of the Volcano Dungeon, which took place on the fourth day of the first chapter.

Born an immortal, fiery phoenix with a legacy as a warrior who single-handedly brought down countless armies. And now? Upon seeing a business drowning in debt and on the verge of collapse, she stepped in—first as an employee, then as the savior who turned it all around. Today, she stands as the radiant owner of this beloved fast-food franchise.
