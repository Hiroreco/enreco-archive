### General

Mori Calliope’s memories were recovered after the conquest of the Underworld Dungeon, which took place on the first day of the first chapter.

As the apprentice of Death, the pink-haired grim reaper’s duty had always been to claim souls, using them as sustenance for those in the underworld.

Yet deep within her heart, she had long harbored doubts about this way of existence. One day, she discovered that instead of harvesting souls, human emotions, specifically their happiness, could serve the same purpose. Rejecting her grim role as a bringer of death, she chose instead to become someone who brings joy to others.
