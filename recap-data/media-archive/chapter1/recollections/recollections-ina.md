### General

Ninomae Ina'nis’ memories were recovered after the conquest of the Eldritch Horror Dungeon, which took place on the third day of the first chapter.

A lone girl residing in a shrine—an area eerie and unsettling, yet softened by the gentle, kind aura she exuded. A priestess of compassion and grace, Ina was tasked with guiding lost souls to their rest. She would play with them, spend time by their side, ensuring that each could pass on peacefully.
