### Description

Hakos Baelz’s memories were recovered after the conquest of the Star Site: Chaos, which took place on the sixth day of the second chapter.

A rat? A genie? A crazy red woman? Whatever she was didn’t matter—her mere presence was enough to plunge everything around her into chaos. She was energetic, she was powerful, she was chaos itself. With a roll of her dice, reality bent to her will, granting both her and those around her whatever wishes they desired.
