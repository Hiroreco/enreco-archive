### Description

Taking place on the first, fourth, and seventh days of Chapter Two, this series of short streams—hosted by Calli and Kiara—served to recap the events of the previous days, helping everyone stay up to date as the story unfolded.

The broadcasts featured fan-made clips highlighting funny moments, readings of journals written by the heroes, and announcements of upcoming dungeons and events scheduled for the day.
