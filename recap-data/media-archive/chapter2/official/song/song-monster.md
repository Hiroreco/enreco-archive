### Description

Released on May 3, 2025, *MONSTER* is the official theme song for the second chapter of **ENigmatic Recollection**, featuring Gigi, Ina, Kronii, and Shiori.

An intense electronic rock track infused with disorienting, jazz-inflected harmonic instability, it perfectly captures the project’s chaotic, high-stakes lore. Lyrically, it explores the **erosion of identity** and the struggle to confront the **inner “monster”**—not an external enemy, but the darkest, fragmented side of oneself screaming from within.

Visually speaking, the song is strikingly well-animated, filled with subtle symbolism tied to the overarching story of the second chapter—most notably, the final sequence where four cards representing the heroes are shown, and only Shiori’s is turned over, by her own hand.
