### Description

Ouro Kronii’s memories were recovered after the conquest of the Star Site: Chronos, which took place on the fourth day of the second chapter.

The Warden of Time itself—the keeper of the timeline, mender of fractures, and corrector of anomalies across dimensions. She maintained the flow of time and upheld the stability of the multiverse.
