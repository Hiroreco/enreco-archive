### Description

Fia came to accept that preventing the Outsider’s birth was impossible. The only path left was to stop whatever his intentions were in the present.

Once more, she called upon the heroes for help. And without hesitation, they answered. They were heroes, after all—if the world needed saving, they would rise to the call, no matter how many times it came.

Tired of being commanded, tired of living roles written by others, they declared rebellion. They would forge their own path. Do things *their* way.
