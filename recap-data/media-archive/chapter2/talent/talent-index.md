### Description

Starting from the second day onward, we see Lady Bloodflame in her office, writing and reading aloud her daily journal—or as she called it, the "Knight’s Log."

These logs recorded the events she had experienced the day before, but more importantly, how those moments had affected her. As she reminisced and reflected, her thoughts grew deeper and more contemplative—about herself, about those around her, and above all, about what it truly meant to be a knight.
