### <u>Description</u>

**Eye of Wisdom** — an unusual name for what's essentially a magnifying glass, but a fitting one when you understand what it represents. This golden-rimmed magnifying glass, complete with a comical mustache, might look far less intimidating than the other heroes' armaments, but it remains the trusty weapon Amelia Watson wielded throughout her journey in Libestal.

### <u>Ability and Story</u>

Amelia Watson is a detective — a self-proclaimed "number one" at that. The kind who solves only the biggest of cases, uncovers the truths of mythical beings, and finds Kiara's burger strangely irresistible. Naturally, it only makes sense for her to rely on her magnifying glass for her detective work.

When activated, the glass emits a radial AoE pulse around Ame, applying a defense and slow debuff to any enemies caught in its range. Despite how complex it sounds, the effect lasts barely half a second — basically a quick bonk that leaves everyone around her momentarily dazed... and charmed by how [ridiculously cute](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=ZfYE4P8UIELdexdN&t=1614) she looks while doing it.
