## Overview

**Burning Phoenix** takes the form of a one-handed sword and a shield. The weapon's design, with its orange and turquoise colors, is strangely reminiscent of the feathers worn by [Tanakisha Karia](#entry:kiara-entry).

## Details

When used, Burning Phoenix launches a fiery attack towards her enemies, then shortly erupts into a brilliant blaze, turning any stains caught in the crossfire into ashes.

Though Karia, known as Shakira to most, awoke without her memories, it does not impede her ability to fight the Stains. Rather, a burning righteousness remains steadfast in this phoenix's heart as she raises her sword and shield with an oath as a knight to defend the beautiful Lesbi, oh, ahem, the shining Kingdom of Libestal! (Lesbians included, of course).
