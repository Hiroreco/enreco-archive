## Overview

**Burning Phoenix** takes the form of a one-handed sword and a shield. Orange and turquoise colors the weapon's design - strangely reminiscent of the feathers Tanakisha Karia wears.

## Details

When used, Burning Phoenix launches a fiery attack towards her enemies before shortly erupting into a brilliant blaze, turning any stains caught in the crossfire into ashes.

Though Karia, Shakira to most, awoke without her memories it does not impede her ability to fight the Stains. Rather, a burning righteousness remains steadfast in this phoenix's heart as she raises her sword and shield in oath as a knight to defend the beautiful Lesbi, oh, ahem, the shining Kingdom of Libestal! (Lesbians included, of course).
