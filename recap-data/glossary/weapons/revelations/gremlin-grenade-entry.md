## Overview

**Gremlin Grenade**, a pair of spiked metal gauntlets—so massive they nearly dwarf their wielder's head—are the weapons worn by our humble knight, [Gonathon G](#entry:gigi-entry), upon his arrival in the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

When activated, the gauntlets launch Gonathon forward, allowing him to perform AoE ground pounds followed by explosions, dealing serious damage to anything unlucky enough to be nearby. Much like Raora’s launch ability, it also lets Gonathon reach places most others can’t… which, yes, he shamelessly exploited to grab [dungeon treasure](https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared&t=6730).

Ever since Chapter 2, the weapon gained an additional [ranged attack.](#entry:revelations-entry)
