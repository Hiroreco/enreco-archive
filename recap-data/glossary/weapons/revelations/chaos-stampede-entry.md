## Overview

**Chaos Stampede**, a six-faced black die with neon-hued dots, is the simple yet undeniably cool weapon that [Peasant da Bae](#entry:bae-entry) wields upon her arrival in the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

Before she resigned herself to the humble life of a peasant—or hermit depending on the day—Bae was the embodiment of Chaos itself. Not that it mattered since she lost her wish-granting box.

Her weapon, however, tells a different story. Unlike the other heroes' weapons, which all have set abilities, _Chaos Stampede_ leaves things to chance. Upon activation, Bae rolls the die, and depending on the number it lands on, the die explodes into a swarm of even more explosive mice, dealing damage in a wide area. The higher the number, the more chaos—and the more explosions—ensue.
