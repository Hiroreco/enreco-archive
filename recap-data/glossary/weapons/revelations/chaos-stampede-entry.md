## Overview

**Chaos Stampede**, a six-faced black die with neon-hued dots, is the simple yet undeniably cool weapon that Peasant da Bae wields upon her arrival in the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

Before she resigned herself to the humble life of a peasant—or hermit, depending on the day—Bae was the embodiment of Chaos itself. Not that anyone would believe her if she said so. After all, she hardly seems the chaotic type these days.

Her weapon, however, tells a different story. Unlike the other heroes' weapons, which all have set abilities, _Chaos Stampede_ leaves things to chance. Upon activation, Bae rolls the die, and depending on the number it lands on, the die explodes into a swarm of even more explosive mice, dealing damage in a wide area. The higher the number, the more chaos—and the more explosions—ensue.
