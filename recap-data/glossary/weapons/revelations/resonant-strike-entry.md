## Overview

**Resonant Strike**, true to its name, takes the form of a massive tuning fork—an oversized metal instrument bestowed upon [Nerrissa Juliet Ravencroft](#entry:nerissa-entry) on Day One of her arrival in the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

A tuning fork may not sound intimidating, but it packs quite the punch. After all, it’s a giant metal fork roughly the size of a person.

Its ability is straightforward: when activated, it emits an area-of-effect sonic blast at the target location, creating a resonant explosion. However, Nerissa rarely takes advantage of the AoE nature of the weapon—instead, she tends to just slam the fork directly onto her target, essentially bonking them into oblivion.

Starting from Chapter 2, the weapon also gained an additional [ranged attack.](#entry:revelations-entry)
