## Overview

**Light and Darkness**, a white and black star, one held in each hand, are the twin weapons bestowed to the [Hot Pink One](entry:irys-entry) upon her arrival in the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

Half devil, half angel—in other words, a Nephilim—was how the hot pink maiden described herself. The dual stars symbolize this dichotomy... before she abandoned the title in favor of simply being _Hot Pink_ (whether she still retains any "angelic" part—after her actions against a certain humble knight, and later his queen—is debatable).

When she activates her weapon's ability, white and black wisps rise into the air, converging into a beam that fires wherever she aims, dealing damage to her targets. As majestic as she tries to make it sound, others have compared the attack to something far less elegant—a [fart](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=foqRHkhJucvdRk3z&t=4046). And with how little damage it does, even she’s begun to wonder: maybe they’re right.
