## Overview

**Winds of Civilization** takes the form of a short bronze dagger, a strangely familiar weapon to Cleopatra Darwin Napoleon Eisenhower Roosevelt Galileo Da Vinci DiCaprio Aristotle Targaryen the Great III, Jr. or simply Three or NanaMoo for short. Sharp as an owl's talon, many should fear this blade and it's owner.

## Details

When the Kingdom of Libestal needed her most, a lone warrior took up the quest against the Stain King and against all odds slayed it. The dagger, when used, summons razor sharp winds that cuts, and washes, away any Stains that dare stands against NanaMoo.

But this dagger... Is this really the first time NanaMoo has seen it? In the past, under a different and simpler name, a fearsome Guardian of Civilization held this same dagger. To protect humanity (or threaten clerics), she kept it with her for millennia. Though her memory is once again gone to the winds, it seems some things remained constant.
