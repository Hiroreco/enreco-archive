## Overview

**Nature's Grace**, a wooden staff adorned with a golden apple, was the weapon—if you could even call it that—wielded by [Ceres Fauna](#entry:fauna-entry) upon her arrival in the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

Her revelation isn’t geared toward offense but support. When activated, Fauna’s staff fully heals all allies within its AoE. Additionally, depending on where she aims, it summons a cage of vines to ensnare enemies. While her role as a healer has been heavily questioned—whether it be her [failure](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=eqNXxwok2sYV58L-&t=6903) to heal teammates when they needed it most, or [charging them](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?t=7796s) for healing while they were getting pummeled—one part of her ability always worked flawlessly: the ensnaring.

Because no one could escape... the lure of her gambling schemes.
