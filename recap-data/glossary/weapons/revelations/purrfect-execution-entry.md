## Overview

**Purrfect Execution**, a playful yet unmistakably intimidating name, is the title of the razor-sharp mechanical claw wielded by [Raora Panthera](#entry:raora-entry) on her journey through Libestal.

## Details

When activated, the big pink cat is launched into the air, executing rapid claw strikes while orbiting around her targetâ€”slashing through multiple enemies like a true feline expertly pouncing on its prey.

Starting in Chapter 2, the claw also gained an additional [ranged attack.](#entry:revelations-entry)
