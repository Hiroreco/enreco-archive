## Overview

**Purrfect Execution**, a playful yet unmistakably intimidating name, is the title of the razor-sharp mechanical claw wielded by [Raora Panthera](#entry:raora-entry) on her journey through Libestal.

## Details

Raora is a panther—a _pink_ one at that. Fierce, relentless, and full of sass. She runs on coffee, harbors a deep disdain for tea, and was once a proud agent of Justice. That was until she lost her memories and she entered a chaotic rivalry with Tam, boldly crowning herself “Queen Mario.”

Despite all that, her claw still reflects the prowess of a deadly feline. When activated, Raora is launched into the air, executing rapid claw strikes while orbiting around her target—slashing through multiple enemies like a cat expertly pouncing on its prey.
