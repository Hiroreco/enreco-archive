## Overview

**Azure Claws**—a pair of razor-sharp, blue claws—are the weapons bestowed upon [Fuwawa Abyssgard](#entry:fuwawa-entry) when she first arrived in the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

The claws’ vicious design stands in stark contrast to Fuwawa’s fluffy, gentle demeanorg. When activated, they unleash a flurry of devastating X-shaped slashes, tearing her targets apart with frightening efficiency. It’s an ability meant to instill fear in any foe.

Of course, true to her kind-hearted nature, Fuwawa has only ever turned this power on monsters and genuine threats—unlike a certain pink someone who might not be quite as selective.
