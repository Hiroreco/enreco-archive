## Overview

**Azure Claws**—a pair of razor-sharp, blue claws—are the weapons bestowed upon Fuwawa Abyssgard when she first arrived in the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

Their vicious design is a stark contrast to Fuwawa’s fluffy and gentle demeanor, but for someone known as the Demon Guard Dog, it’s a fitting match.

When activated, the claws unleash devastating X-shaped slashes in a flurry, shredding her target into bits. It’s an ability meant to strike fear into any foe. That said, ever the kind-hearted pup, Fuwawa has only used it against monsters and true threats—unlike a certain pink someone who might be a bit less discerning.
