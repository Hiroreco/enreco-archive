## Overview

**Rest In Peace** is a name as fitting as it is ominous for a scythe. This isn't the kind you'd find in a farmer's shed; its design is dark and foreboding, with a jagged handle and a protruding joint that amplifies the menace of its razor-sharp blade. This was the weapon wielded by [Mori Calliope](#entry:calli-entry) on her journey through Libestal.

## Details

The Grim Reaper herself—the literal embodiment of Death—naturally carries a scythe of such sinister stature though her career pivot to tavern owner offering divorce services and getting herself knocked out by a truck somewhat tarnishes that terrifying image.

As for its ability, it's as straightforward as Calli herself. No magic. No flashy tricks. Just a single, powerful, lateral swing—cleaving through her target.
