## Overview

**Rest In Peace** is a name as fitting as it is ominous for a scythe. This isn't the kind you'd find in a farmer's shed; its design is dark and foreboding, with a jagged handle and a protruding joint that amplifies the menace of its razor-sharp blade. This was the weapon wielded by [Mori Calliope](#entry:calli-entry) on her journey through Libestal.

## Details

The Grim Reaper herself—the literal embodiment of Death—naturally wields a scythe that radiates a deeply sinister aura. However, the light-hearted and caring nature of the pink one, always eager to try silly things and help others, somewhat tarnishes that fearsome image.

As for its ability, it’s as straightforward as Calli herself. No magic, no flashy tricks—just a single, powerful, lateral swing that cleaves clean through her target.

Starting from Chapter 2, the weapon also gained an additional [ranged attack.](#entry:revelations-entry)
