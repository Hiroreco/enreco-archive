## Overview

**Thorn**, a greatsword, a claymore—or, in simpler terms, a _really_ big sword—stands out as one of the most striking weapons among all the heroes, purely due to its overwhelming size. Naturally, only a knight as noble as [Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame](#entry:liz-entry) could wield such a formidable blade.

## Details

If there’s anyone most deserving of a sword, it’s Elizabeth. A true knight through and through, even without recollection of her former self, the scarlet one's sense of chivalry remains unwavering, as she continues to fight for righteousness throughout her journey in Libestal despite all the weirdness surrounding her.

Upon activation, Thorn unleashes a sweeping lateral strike followed by a powerful explosion. It’s a simple move—but one that speaks volumes through sheer force.

Starting in Chapter 2, the blade also gained an additional [ranged attack.](#entry:revelations-entry)
