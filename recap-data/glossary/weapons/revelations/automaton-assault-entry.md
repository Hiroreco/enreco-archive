## Overview

**Automaton Assault**, a lance adorned in gold and green, is the beloved weapon of [Cecilia Immergreen](#entry:cecilia-entry) on her journey through the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

An ancient automaton, a champion of Justice with a love for flowers, tea, and assaulting the world with her _very unbiased_ opinions, it’s only fitting her weapon carries such a name.

When activated, Cecilia unleashes a concentrated flurry of spear strikes at her enemies. As terrifying as being on the receiving end of a rapid-fire poking spree sounds, the intimidation factor tends to wear off just a bit—thanks to the adorably cheerful catchphrase she never forgets to shout right before launching her target into oblivion.
