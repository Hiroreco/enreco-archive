## Overview

**Automaton Assault**, a lance adorned in gold and green, is the signature weapon of [Cecilia Immergreen](#entry:cecilia-entry) during her journey through the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

True to its name, Automaton Assault enables Cecilia to unleash a rapid flurry of spear strikes upon her enemies. While the sheer speed and force of the attack are intimidating, the effect is often slightly undercut by Ceciliaâ€™s unshakable habit of shouting an adorably cheerful catchphrase before launching her foes into oblivion.
