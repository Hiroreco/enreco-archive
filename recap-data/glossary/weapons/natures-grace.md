## Overvie

**Nature's Grace**, a wooden staff adorned with a golden apple, was the weapon—if you could even call it that—wielded by Ceres Fauna upon her arrival in the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Detail

The golden apple is a nod to her title as Mother Nature—one who once brought life and greenery wherever she went... before capitalism got to her, she formed a monopoly, and started draining everyone’s wallets.

Her ability isn’t geared toward offense, but support. When activated, Fauna’s staff fully heals all allies within its AoE. Additionally, depending on where she aims, it summons a cage of vines to ensnare enemies. While her role as a healer has been… heavily questioned—be it her [failure](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=eqNXxwok2sYV58L-&t=6903) to heal teammates when they needed it most, or [charging them](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?t=7796s) for healing while they were getting pummeled—one part of her ability always worked flawlessly: the ensnaring.

Because no one could escape... the lure of her gambling schemes.
