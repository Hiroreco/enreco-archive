### <u>Description</u>

**Chrono Surge**—a pair of clock hands, with the minute hand wielded in her main and the hour hand in her offhand—are the trusty blades of Tam Gandr, the self-proclaimed queen of Libestal.

### <u>Ability and Story</u>

Long before she found herself tangled in royal business and throne-claiming antics, Tam bore the title of **Warden of Time**. A name as intimidating as it sounds—had people known her true identity, her queenly claims would’ve raised far fewer eyebrows.

The keyword here is _Time_. Upon activating the ability of her twin blades, Tam freezes time for all entities within a certain radius and deals damage to those caught in the stasis. However, this ability doesn’t affect her fellow heroes—so unless there’s a real enemy nearby, her ultimate time-freezing move turns into a whole lot of [flashy nothing](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?si=a7sNjb8ZFNpUudXp&t=7695).
