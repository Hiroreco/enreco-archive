## Overview

**Resonant Strike**, true to its name, takes the form of a massive tuning fork—an oversized metal instrument that serves as Nerissa Ravencroft's weapon, bestowed upon her on Day One of her arrival in the Kingdom of Libestal.

## Details

Originally wielded by the Demon of Sound before she lost her memories, a tuning fork may not sound intimidating, but it packs quite the punch. After all, it’s a giant metal fork roughly the size of a person.

Its ability is straightforward: when activated, it emits an area-of-effect sonar blast at the target location, creating a resonant explosion. However, Nerissa doesn’t usually pay attention to the AoE nature of the weapon—instead, she tends to just slam the fork directly onto her target, essentially bonking them into oblivion.
