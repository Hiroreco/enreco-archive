### <u>Description</u>

**Shining Emotions** takes the form of a purple octahedral gem, wielded by none other than Koseki Bijou.

### <u>Ability and Story</u>

A radiant gem for the Princess of Jewels—it’s only fitting. And while its name might evoke something emotional or sparkly, the actual ability is much more straightforward… and a bit comedic. When activated, Bijou unleashes a rapid barrage of gem projectiles at her target, flinging them at high speed and frequency.

It might not be as magical as the name implies, but it’s brutally effective. After all, getting pelted in the face with diamond-hard rocks at Mach speed? That’ll ruin anyone’s day.
