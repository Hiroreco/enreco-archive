### <u>Description</u>

**Oceanic Terror**, a blue trident as tall as its wielder—or as its owner fondly calls it, a _fork_—is Gawr Gura's chosen weapon for her journey in Libestal.

### <u>Ability and Story</u>

Once the princess of Atlantis, the trident perfectly suits her royal, oceanic heritage... though some folks are more inclined to believe she’s just a particularly scrappy commoner with a fancy stick (which she stole).

When the fork’s ability is activated, Gura summons a surge of shimmering blue waves, like a cascading watery curtain, crashing toward her enemies and dealing damage. Some say the attack can push foes back as well, though sightings of that happening are few and far between.
