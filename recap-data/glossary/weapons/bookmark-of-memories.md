### <u>Description</u>

**Bookmark of Memories**, Shiori Novella's Revelation, takes the form of a blue feather—more precisely, a quill meant for writing. It was bestowed upon her when she was first summoned to the Kingdom of Libestal.

### <u>Ability and Story</u>

When activated, the quill summons bookmarks that hover around Shiori, firing beams that converge at her target. Upon impact, the beams explode, dealing significant damage.

The quill serves as a subtle reminder of her role as an _Archiver_—a past she no longer remembers. Perhaps it was this lack of recollection that led her to use it for mischief rather than battle, often opting to tickle people with it instead. Unfortunately, she tended to forget that doing so could accidentally trigger its ability, much to the misfortune of any unsuspecting bystanders.
