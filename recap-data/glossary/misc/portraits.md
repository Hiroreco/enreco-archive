## Overview

In Chapter 2, there was a sidequest where the heroes could ask an aritst, Pygmalion, to "draw" a portrait of themsevles. These portraits were actually selected from winners of the #ENrecoCanvas campaign, an event/competition preceding the start of Chapter 2, which started on March 1st 2025 and ended on March 19th 2025.

## Details

The quest itself required the heroes to gather materials for the artist, first 5 raw iron, 5 raw copper, then 1 butter, then 1 Basic Upgrade Stone, and finally, a Basic Azure Charm. As tedious as the process sounds, it acted as a way for the heroes to get familiarized with asking each other for help, as each of the material above was only obtainable from a specific occupation: Iron and copper from a Supplier, butter from a Chef, Basic Upgrade Stone from a Smith, and Basic Azure Charm from a Jeweler.

The portrait specific to the hero doing the quest, meaning each portrait was unique to each hero. And each of them was uniquie in style, and story in their own unique way.
