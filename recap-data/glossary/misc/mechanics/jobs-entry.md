## Overview

Jobs were introduced in Chapter Two as a replacement for the guild system. Unlike guilds, which grouped heroes by philosophy or personality, jobs added mechanical depth and individual progression by allowing heroes to choose professions that defined their contributions to the world of [Ancient Libestal](#entry:libestal-ancient-entry).

## Details

### Preface

Upon arriving in Ancient Libestal, the heroes were encouraged to pick a job that suited their interests to help them integrate into their new life. These jobs were not just titles—they introduced entirely new gameplay systems and collaboration mechanics.

### The Four Jobs

There were four jobs available, each with a distinct specialty. The design of the system encouraged interdependence—heroes were meant to rely on one another’s crafts to thrive in their journey.

As heroes practiced their crafts, their job levels increased, unlocking stronger buffs, items, and abilities.

Furthermore, the heroes could set up stalls or shops to sell their specialized crafted goods, allowing them to trade with one another and ~~scam~~ support the community through their unique professions.

#### Smith

**Occupants:** [Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame](#entry:liz-entry), [Gonathon G](#entry:gigi-entry), [Tanakisha Karia](#entry:kiara-entry)
**Lead:** Master Smith Heph

Smiths specialized in forging upgrade stones to enhance Revelation weapons, using a toolset known as the Smithing Tools.

Crafting involved using a large grid similar to a crafting table but with more complexity. Players had to arrange materials according to recipes shown in a recipe book to create the desired upgrade stones.

Smiths also gained a passive combat buff: a scaling chance to deal increased damage on hit, based on their job level.

#### Jeweler

**Occupants:** [Koseki Bijou](#entry:bijou-entry), [NinoIna](#entry:ina-entry), [Roa Pandora](#entry:raora-entry), [Mococo Abyssguard](#entry:mococo-entry)
**Lead:** Grand Jeweler Chrys

Jewelers created charms that boosted health and defense. Each charm required specific materials, and crafting involved a memory-based minigame.

A board filled with various stat buffs would be shown briefly before going blank. Jewelers had to recall the positions of their desired buffs and select them accurately. The chance of enhanced buffs increased with Jeweler level.

Charms came in three different colors. Heroes could equip one charm of each color, encouraging thoughtful stat combinations.

#### Chef

**Occupants:** [Hot Pink One](#entry:irys-entry), [Shiori Nyavella](#entry:shiori-entry), [Nerissa Ravencroft](#entry:nerissa-entry), [Mordan Ramsey](#entry:calli-entry), [Fuwawa Abyssguard](#entry:fuwawa-entry)
**Lead:** Executive Chef Ambros

Chefs prepared meals that granted powerful, long-lasting buffs. The cooking system mirrored that of Chapter One: a recipe book listed the required ingredients, which were then placed into a pot before hitting the "cook" button.

The more meals a chef prepared, the higher their cooking pot's level became. Higher levels increased the chance of creating Gourmet food, which offered stronger or extended effects.

#### Supplier

**Occupants:** [Cecilia Immerkind](#entry:cecilia-entry), [Peasant Da Bae](#entry:bae-entry), [Tam Gandr](#entry:kronii-entry)
**Lead:** Supplier Foreman Kory

Suppliers focused on resource collection through enchanted tools and a unique mining minigame.

Using lapis lazuli, they added durability to a special pick, then mined a grid of randomized blocks to collect iron, gold, and diamond ores—each contributing enchantment points. Up to 40 points could be earned per run.

Once durability ran out, points could be allocated to enchant tools with traits like Efficiency, Unbreaking, Fortune, and even a unique auto-smelting enchantment that converted mined ore directly into ingots.

Suppliers also had exclusive charms that boosted their mining effectiveness. When paired with high job levels and upgraded tools, they became unmatched in resource gathering.
