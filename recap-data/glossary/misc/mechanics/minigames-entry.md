## Overview

Aside from the usual questing, the heroes could take some time off to relax and refresh their minds by participating in the kingdom’s minigames. These ranged from simple tests of strength and intelligence to losing all your savings betting on a color.

## Details

There are currently **four minigames**, each originally introduced in **Chapter 1**, with every game initially representing one of the four [guilds](#entry:guilds-entry) reflecting its respective guild's ideology (only in Chapter 1).

### **Color Cannon**

**Appearance:** Chapter 1, Chapter 2
**Representing Guild:** Amber Coin

A game of chance and tension. Players place wagers on any of four available colors:

- **Blue** (x2 multiplier) – 12 positions
- **Green** (x3 multiplier) – 8 positions
- **Yellow** (x5 multiplier) – 4 positions
- **Red** (x10 multiplier) – 1 position

Once the game begins, colors are eliminated one by one on a large board until only one color remains. Those who bet on the final surviving color receive their wager multiplied accordingly. High risk, high reward.

### **Duel Arena**

**Appearance:** Chapter 1, Chapter 2
**Representing Guild:** Jade Sword

A test of strength, reflex, and endurance. Two challengers face off using only wooden swords, and the match continues until one remains standing.

In Chapter 2, an added rule ensures the match ends in a draw if both participants are still standing after one minute. Furthermore, they could also place bets on which side they thought would come out victorious.

### **Mind’s Eye**

**Appearance:** Chapter 1
**Representing Guild:** Scarlet Wand

A memory-based minigame where four players compete to recreate a color arrangement shown for a few seconds. Each correct color grants **+1 point**, and perfectly recreating a full arrangement awards bonus points based on the number of colors involved, while incorrect guesses deduct **-5 points**. As rounds progress, the difficulty increases with more complex patterns and color combinations. The player with the highest score at the end wins.

### **Chicken Rescue**

**Appearance:** Chapter 1
**Representing Guild:** Cerulean Cup

A solo challenge where the player must control a basket to catch chickens falling from the sky on a 2D grid. Basket movement mirrors the player’s own movements. The objective is to catch as many chickens as possible within the time limit of one minute. Scores are recorded on a leaderboard, encouraging repeat attempts and competition.
