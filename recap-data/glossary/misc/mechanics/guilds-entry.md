## Overview

Guilds were created to organize the heroes into manageable groups and served as the foundational pillars of [Libestal](#entry:libestal-ficta-entry) in Chapter One.

## Details

### Preface

After the temporary defeat of the Stain King, the four guildmasters introduced themselves and shared the philosophies behind their respective guilds. Each hero was then assigned to one of these four guilds by the Room of Truth.

### Guilds and Members

Guild assignments were made based on perceived alignment with each guild’s philosophy—though many questioned how accurate these alignments were, considering the often humorous mismatch between a hero’s personality and their assigned values.

Each guild also hosted its own unique event or minigame within its headquarters.

#### Scarlet Wand

**Members:** [Cecilia Immergreen](#entry:cecilia-entry), [Gawr Gura](#entry:gura-entry), [Ceres Fauna](#entry:fauna-entry), [Nerissa Juliet Ravencroft](#entry:nerissa-entry), [Shiori Nyavella](#entry:shiori-entry)
**Guildmaster:** Rubius

Marked by their iconic long red hats, the Scarlet Wand was a sanctuary for the curious—where knowledge and creativity were held in the highest regard. However, thanks to a suspicious lottery scheme, the guild earned a reputation for scamming and mind-reading, with many calling them witches.

Their headquarters resembled a traditional wooden guild hall filled with arcane charm.

#### Amber Coin

**Members:** [Takanashi Kiara](#entry:kiara-entry), [Nanamoo](#entry:mumei-entry), [Raora Panthera](#entry:raora-entry), [Peasant The Bae](#entry:bae-entry)
**Guildmaster:** Auren

A haven for dreamers, visionaries, and glory-seekers—where friends could easily become rivals. Amber Coin had a rocky start, accused by others (especially the Ceruleans) of murder, kidnapping, and general coin-chasing greed.

Over time, the guild lost several members: Bae vanished into the woods, and Nanamoo became an honorary member of the Scarlet Wand, leaving only Kiara and her pink feline companion as the last two standing.

Their luxurious palace-like headquarters featured grand gardens and a casino—an opulent display fitting for their name.

#### Cerulean Cup

**Members:** [Tam Gandr](#entry:kronii-entry), [Gonathon G](#entry:gigi-entry), [Ninomae Ina’nis](#entry:ina-entry), [Hot Pink One](#entry:irys-entry), [Koseki Bijou](#entry:bijou-entry)
**Guildmaster:** Celesta

A sanctum devoted to healing and empathy... in theory. In practice, most members, except for Ina, were far from empathetic, often picking fights with other guilds for unclear reasons, particularly through instigators Tam and Gonathon.

Their base took the form of a serene, open-air temple that radiated tranquility—regardless of how its members behaved.

#### Jade Sword

**Members:** [Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame](#entry:liz-entry), [Mori Calliope](#entry:calli-entry), [Fuwawa Abyssguard](#entry:fuwawa-entry), [Mococo Abyssguard](#entry:mococo-entry), [Jyon Watson](#entry:ame-entry)
**Guildmaster:** Viridus

Champions of justice and loyalty, Jade Sword was built to stand against great evils with even greater courage. Despite this noble ideal, the guild included a gambling addict, a divorce-selling tavern owner, an exceptionally kind, fluffy girl, a quirky blonde detective, and Elizabeth—perhaps the only one who truly embodied the chivalric ideal.

Their headquarters was a large, circular arena visible from afar, designed as a training ground for swordplay.
