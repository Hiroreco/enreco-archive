## Overview

In Chapter 2, a sidequest allowed the heroes to request a portrait of themselves from an artist named Pygmalion. These portraits were special—they were selected entries from the **#ENrecoCanvas** campaign, a fan art [event](https://x.com/hololive_En/status/1895609934085325149) that ran from `March 1st to March 19th, 2025`, before the start of the chapter.

## Details

To receive a portrait, the heroes needed to help Pygmalion by gathering a set of materials. The task was intentionally a bit tedious, as it encouraged cooperation among the heroes. Each item was tied to a specific profession, meaning players had to seek out others in those roles:

- **5 Raw Iron, 5 Raw Copper** – from a Supplier
- **1 Butter** – from a Chef
- **1 Basic Upgrade Stone** – from a Smith
- **1 Basic Azure Charm** – from a Jeweler

This quest acted not only as a way to earn a personalized portrait but also as a clever method to promote player interaction and teamwork early in Chapter 2.

Each hero's portrait was unique, both in art style and in the story it portrayed, capturing something personal and special about that character—making the reward as memorable as it was [meaningful.](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=xnTcW4oA0I5l5zax&t=4441)
