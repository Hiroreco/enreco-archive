## Overview

**Day Unlocked:** 4

**Star Site: Chronos** was the second of the three star sites in Chapter 2, setting itself apart with a strong central theme: _time_. This dungeon contained the memories of none other than the Warden of Time herself, [Ouro Kronii](#entry:kronii-entry), and, as expected, the puzzles and mechanics were all built around the manipulation of time.

## Details

### Appearance

Among all the dungeons in Chapter 2, Star Site: Chronos had perhaps the most elegant, formal, and grand design. The core structure was a towering clock tower, painted in regal shades of deep blue and shimmering gold, perched atop a wide circular platform of matching colors, where all the challenges were held. Each of the platform’s four corners was marked with ornate clock symbols, reinforcing the time motif.

Suspended within a serene void bathed in cool blue hues, the tower glowed softly with scattered points of light, echoing the enchanting twinkle of distant stars in the background. The atmosphere exuded a sense of command and reverence—as if those who entered were stepping into a domain governed by one of the universe’s most sacred forces: time itself.

### Puzzles

The dungeon introduced its main mechanic immediately: each room presented a brief **10-second timer** to complete an objective. A central device called the **timer block** allowed the players to manipulate this timer in various ways—**playing**, **pausing**, **rewinding**, or **resetting** time depending on the challenge.

**First Puzzle**

A simple challenge to ease the group in: cross a [gap](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=Wl_THIyIf_zPzyLC&t=686) before the timer runs out. The timer block here only allows restarting the countdown.

**Second Puzzle**

A maze with [moving walls](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=uw5ysU_bCtSsY0Vo&t=765) that close when the timer hits zero. Resetting the timer reopens the walls. Players must navigate through the maze and press all floor buttons to unlock the next area.

**Third Puzzle**

Set inside a clock tower, this room features [four angled mirrors](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=9ipSXdXbJZx-cklg&t=1222) mounted on pillars. When play is pressed, the timer block emits a beam of light that can be paused in midair. By sliding the pillars, the team must reflect the light to hit a target tile above the door to progress. Pausing and restarting the light beam is essential to success.

**Fourth Puzzle**

Higher in the clocktower is a [colored wall maze](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=vWL35RPlcj3FKtwZ&t=1850): six different colored walls can be raised by pressing corresponding buttons. Depending on when in the 10 second window the button is pressed, the wall will end up at a different height. Players have to correctly time the walls so that they can get under them on the lower floor but not block their path on the upper floor. Like the other puzzles the timer block allows for pausing and playing.

Exploration here also reveals secret cracked blocks—when the green wall is raised, players can break through the cracks to unlock a shortcut back to the mirror room. Using the mirrors and pillars again allows traversal to another breakable wall, hiding a chest with the dungeon's music disc.

**Fifth Puzzle**

By far the most complex challenge in the dungeon. A massive [multi-layered maze](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=hccb2ghDRdj1nsgO&t=2636) with moving platforms, fenced walls, and cube structures embedded with colored buttons. The timer block now supports rewinding and moving platforms between positions. Players must:

- Press rewind or play to position the platforms correctly
- Press buttons to open colored gates
- Use precise platforming to traverse tight paths and reach the exit

This final puzzle tests everything learned in the dungeon: logic, timing, teamwork, and movement.

**Final Boss – Stain King Chronos**

The boss fight cleverly incorporates the time gimmick. Chronos summons pillars with numbers on top, and players must set the timer block to the matching number in order to destroy the pillar and make the boss vulnerable.

Chronos can also rewind its own health bar, healing back damage taken, forcing players to essentially redo the fight.
