## Overview

**Day Unlocked:** 1

The **Underworld Dungeon** was the first of Chapter 1’s five major dungeons, themed around Mori Calliope. Described as a domain of boundless darkness, it represented the land of the dead—home to both those who had passed and those who watched over their passing.

## Details

### Appearance

A dark, gloomy, and intimidating aura permeated the dungeon. Outside, floating rocks hovered above pools of lava, leading up to a towering castle where the main challenges awaited. The castle, constructed primarily of black basalt bricks with streaks of crimson nether bricks, radiated a sinister elegance. Red light poured through a giant window pane backed by lava, while fire torches lit the long, shadowy corridors that wound through each stage. It was an imposing structure that demanded respect.

### Puzzles

- **Platform Parkour:** The first official dungeon challenge in this enigmatic adventure, where the heroes had to leap across [floating rocks](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?si=F_b9Fzm_PqfGy2wJ&t=10800) suspended over lava to reach the main dungeon area.

- **Mob Slaying:** Inside the castle’s first maze-like hall, the heroes faced monsters carrying panes of glass. [Slaying](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?si=sFOM71YcWPl-VwhQ&t=10926) enough of these creatures unlocked the path forward.

- **Lights On:** A large cube of [redstone lamps](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?si=7GChsp0b4cow1sKS&t=11075) glowed in a predefined pattern. Clicking a lamp would toggle it and the lamps adjacent in a plus shape on or off. The goal was to illuminate the entire cube.

- **Climb the Dungeon’s Tree:** Here, the heroes needed to lure attacking skeletons onto a block where a small mushroom grew. Slaying the skeletons caused the plant to [grow](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?si=PhIFZ1_WkalwvoTJ&t=11579) taller each time. They had to nurture it to reach a height that allowed them to climb into the final area and complete the conquest.
