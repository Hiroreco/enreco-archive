## Overview

**Day Unlocked**: 4

The Volcanic Dungeon was by far the most challenging dungeon in Chapter 1, featuring a gauntlet of fiery obstacles designed to test the heroes’ patience and perseverance. Fittingly, its central theme revolved around resurrection and retrying—embodying the spirit of the mighty phoenix, Takanashi Kiara.

## Details

### Appearance

The dungeon followed a strong fiery motif, its structure resembling a massive castle or labyrinth suspended above a lake of lava.

### Challenges

#### Lasers and Traps

Rather than puzzles, the Volcanic Dungeon emphasized physical trials, riddled with dangerous traps throughout its castle interior. These included dodging searing [lasers](https://www.youtube.com/live/N3v-MJXHQ0w?si=rFVQeKPLGv5Zumnz&t=6526) that incinerated on contact and navigating deviously placed [bait-traps](https://www.youtube.com/live/N3v-MJXHQ0w?si=8JvYnazYsw-n5I-I&t=7215) disguised as buttons tempting curious adventurers.

The arsenal of traps featured:

- Fire bar traps
- Lava pitfalls
- Powdered snow traps
- Falling anvil traps
- Magma traps
- Fireball traps
- Poison traps

#### Parkour and Boss Fight

Towards the dungeon’s climax, heroes had to ascend through intricate [parkour sequences](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?si=34q6OX2oqyM_n2rX&t=15634) across various platform types—some that alternated positions, others that only appeared briefly before vanishing. Missing a jump meant falling into certain doom.

At the summit stood the Flame Guardian, a towering statue of a goddess-like figure who served as the dungeon’s final boss. Heroes had to leap across floating platforms while evading the Guardian’s fire beams, ultimately reaching the statue and using pickaxes to chip away at its core until its health bar dropped to zero.
