## Overview

**Day Unlocked:** 2

**Star Site: Elpis** was the first major dungeon tackled by the heroes in Chapter 2, and the first of the three memory dungeons in this arc. Within its walls resided the fragmented memories of [IRyS](#entry:irys-entry), the embodiment of hope and despair.

## Details

### Appearance

The dungeon was deeply rooted in the concept of a nephilim, split between two opposing forces. One side embodied the angelic, bathed in brilliant white and soft pastel blues, evoking a sense of serenity and purity. The other side channeled the demonic, cloaked in deep crimson reds that radiated intensity and conflict.

Each side consisted of a long corridor filled with challenges, paralleling each other and separated so that neither path could see the other. Only after all trials on both paths were completed did the two halves converge, reuniting for the final boss fight.

### Puzzles

Designed for at least two people, the dungeon splits the party into two teams, the **Angelic Side** and the **Demonic Side**, who must cooperate to solve a series of puzzles in order to progress.

**First Puzzle**

The Angelic Side is presented with a [circle of red blocks](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=MAqpJXpQJXmj2K6e&t=3573) topped with buttons. Pressing a button changes the block's color to blue. These colors must be matched to the Demonic Side, where red and blue [campfires](https://www.youtube.com/live/NSOuyMjCxPI?si=03CadFAr7PQ8DJvd&t=4524) are also arranged in a circle.

**Second Puzzle**

The Angelic Side is given a [movable block](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=DDnmLpQW0CXpggdp&t=3694), which must be pushed through a floor-based puzzle according to a [maze map](https://www.youtube.com/live/NSOuyMjCxPI?si=wgLETZiPN-WpX7qy&t=4666) only visible on the Demonic Side.

- A small rectangular tutorial map introduces the mechanic.
- The main puzzle features a larger maze on the Demonic Side, while the Angelic Side sees a circular area with colored blocks on the ground.
- **Note:** Pushing the block onto a tile made of black and red terracotta unlocks a secret door at the end of the dungeon containing a [music disc](https://www.youtube.com/live/A97SrozF36w?si=zNzhwalpOc_S6Tu_&t=7429).

**Third Puzzle**

Now floating over an abyss, the maze requires players on the Angelic Side to carefully [navigate](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=8ijRq_d2gpa0y5mv&t=4273) their way through it. The Demonic Side assists by standing on a large [flat area](https://www.youtube.com/live/NSOuyMjCxPI?si=8UiI1wWq3zOPqzNm&t=5227) where stains spawn. The positions of the players on the demonic side correspond to a position on the angelic side represented as a floating platform.

After completing the final puzzle, both teams reunite to face the dungeon boss, **Stain King Elpis**, a two-headed dragon.
