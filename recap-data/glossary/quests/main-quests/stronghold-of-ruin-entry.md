## Overview

**Unlocked on**: Day 3

The **Stronghold of Ruin** marked the place where the heroes first encountered the [Outlander](#entry:outsider-entry), a nameless swordsman the Princess had specifically tasked them to find. He, too, had been investigating the stronghold—only to fall victim to the lingering corruption that trapped him inside. Thanks to the heroes' efforts in conquering the dungeon, he was ultimately freed.

## Details

### Appearance

This dungeon served as a branch of the Heart of Ruin, which explained the visual and atmospheric similarities between them. It was cloaked in a dark, ominous palette of reds and shadows, creating an oppressive sense of danger. The structure featured large, round platforms where challenges took place, culminating in a final arena adorned with floating red crystals—where the dungeon’s boss awaited.

### Puzzles

Upon entering, the party was granted a checkpoint system and 5 shared lives, setting the tone for the challenging trials ahead.

**First Challenge**

The dungeon began with a gauntlet of [stain-filled arenas](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=Yz9FvKwuZtv4e-ZS&t=1423). Each arena required the party to defeat all spawned stains before the gates would open and allow them to move forward, and the fights escalated in intensity as they progressed.

**Second Challenge**

Next, the party encountered artifacts represented as black roses. To advance meant destroying those roses, and in order to do so, the heroes needed to first solve puzzles:

- One puzzle involved a series of [math problems](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=kbaxo2QGrPfrE5La&t=2999).
- The other required solving a sequence [memory lock](https://www.youtube.com/live/Lp7GyRVbz1c?si=eZeTfPLnxXrZZVP7&t=2892).

All the while, stains continued to spawn endlessly, making puzzle-solving a frantic and dangerous task until all the black roses were destroyed.

**Intermission**

Progressing further, the heroes entered a quiet but eerie library, where they discovered a riddle etched into a hidden corner of the room:

> _"The heart is distant, under lock and key
> And hides in corners far from enemy."_

**Final Challenge**

The last room housed **Stain King Proto**, guarding a crystal linked to something greater—the [Heart of Ruin](#entry:heart-of-ruin-entry), an as-yet unrevealed location that would eventually come into play.

The arena was surrounded by four more black roses, one in each corner, each protected by the same types of puzzles encountered earlier (math and memory). Only after the roses were destroyed could the chest containing the music disc be accessed post-battle.
