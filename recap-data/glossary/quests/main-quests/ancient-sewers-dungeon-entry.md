## Overview

**Day Unlocked:** 5

The Ancient Sewer Dungeon was the final dungeon of Chapter 1, containing the memories of the number one silly, cute, and quirky detective beloved by all—[Amelia Watson](#entry:ame-entry).

## Details

### Appearance

In stark contrast to the grand, mythical settings of the previous four dungeons—castles, temples, labyrinths—the Ancient Sewer Dungeon was located, as the name implies, beneath a sewer system. Comprised of twisting tunnels and junctions built with mud bricks, the setting was modest yet exuded a strange sense of mystery and intrigue that invited exploration.

### Puzzles

Compared to the other dungeons, this one featured the simplest challenge: [a quiz](https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?si=mMXZ1h38Mujkzloh&t=4056). The heroes had to answer a sequence of five questions testing their knowledge of the journey so far. Each question offered multiple choices. A correct answer allowed them to advance; a wrong answer transported them to a chamber filled with Stains, which they had to defeat before trying again.

Each question was tied to previous dungeon events and memory fragments, with the final question requiring the players to explore the dungeon itself for a hidden clue.

The questions were as follows:

**Which source of energy did a certain offbeat reaper discover?**
– Answer: People’s strong emotions

**Which of these guards the force field around Atlantis?**
– Answer: Shark statues

**A mysterious boy appeared at a certain shrine. What is he particularly good at?**
– Answer: Folding origami

**What is the grand achievement of a certain oddball phoenix?**
– Answer: Helping a fast food restaurant pay its debt

**What did a certain detective invent for the travelers who made it this far?**
– Answer: A Warp Crystal

Answer all five correctly to clear the final dungeon of the first chapter.
