## Overview
 
The **Ocean Temple Dungeon** holds the remnants of a once-thriving underwater society now forgotten. This was the home of the last surviving member, whose memories can be found here as well— Gawr Gura.

## Details

### History

There was once a civilization that prospered in both innovative technology and culture. At its peak, this civilization sank to the ocean's floor and rebuilt itself, becoming what is known as Atlantis. 

### Appearance

In the present day, the dungeon is an empty shell of what Atlantis used to be. To enter, the heroes must swim to an underwater cave where a portal transports them to the entrance at the threshold of a stone-walled city. Each step they take is cushioned by the vibrant green moss that has claimed the once-bustling streets, giving the place an air of enchantment and mystery. Towering above are intricately carved shark statues, which could be mistaken for dolphins, each possibly depicting a celebrated figure of the past.

### Puzzles

Tower of Hanoi: Stack all rings on the third rod in decreasing size order.

Bridge Puzzle: Activate color-coded bridges whilst avoiding laser traps and falling to advance to the other side.

Directional Guard Puzzle: Lead a mannequin guard on the prismarine route to an elevated platform. Letting the guard pass by the 5 embedded golden blocks in the ground unlocks the dungeon's treasure.
