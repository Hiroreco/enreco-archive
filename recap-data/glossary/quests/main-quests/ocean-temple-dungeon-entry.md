## Details

### History

There was once a civilization that prospered in both innovative technology and culture. At its peak, the civilization sank to the ocean floor and rebuilt itself, becoming what is now known as Atlantis.

### Appearance

Today, the dungeon is an empty shell of what Atlantis once was. To enter, the heroes must swim to an underwater cave, where a portal transports them to the threshold of a stone-walled city. Each step is cushioned by vibrant green moss that has overtaken the once-bustling streets, lending the place an air of enchantment and mystery. Towering above are intricately carved shark statues, which could be mistaken for dolphins; each may depict a celebrated figure from the past.

### Puzzles

- **Tower of Hanoi:** Stack all the [rings](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?si=9T-46rQ15ghlkjRc&t=5810) on the third rod in decreasing size order.

- **Bridge Puzzle:** Activate [color-coded](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?si=RRQ8rSSECOvsw8e_&t=6098) bridges while avoiding laser traps and falls to reach the other side.

- **Directional Guard Puzzle:** Lead a [mannequin](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?si=-QX63tFq7Cp2tcxT&t=6384) guard on the prismarine route to an elevated platform. Allowing the guard to pass over the five embedded golden blocks in the ground unlocks the dungeon's treasure.
