## Overview

**Day Unlocked**: 5

Star Site: Chaos was the third and final star site in Chapter 2, standing out significantly from the previous two. Fittingly, the memories it contained belonged to none other than the embodiment of chaos herself—[Hakos Baelz](#entry:bae-entry).

## Details

### Appearance

At the center of the dungeon hovered a massive, circular roulette platform, suspended in a swirling void. Surrounding it were six towering structures shaped like doors, each leading to a unique minigame. The entire dungeon was adorned in gleaming white quartz, which contrasted with bold primary color palettes that gave the space a bright, vibrant, and almost surreal energy—perfectly capturing the essence of chance and chaos.

### Games

Unlike the earlier dungeons where puzzles were the main focus, the primary gimmick here was a collection of minigames determined by spinning a roulette wheel. Player performance in these games was tracked by a **luck meter**—the better the performance, the more luck gained.

There were five different minigames, each with its own unique objective.

**Shaky Floor Showdown**
Players must defeat as many Stains as possible while [the floor](https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=ehUP_KK9qRn2DrzW&t=4127) collapses beneath them with each step. The game ends when all players fall.

**Balloon Pop**
Players are given [colored balls](https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=ZN4CDNF33MknO8Qa&t=8297) and must match them to the corresponding colored balloons, popping as many as possible before time runs out.

**Blind Round**
Players must [push a button](https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=byW4Jzn2G2E6zxj2&t=8083) across a pit by using platforms that appear and disappear in intervals. The more presses within the time limit, the better the score.

**Boss Room?**
A [deceptive room](https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=8feoLm3SloHkkDFp&t=4581) where attacking the sleeping Stain causes the party to gain no luck. Avoid the bait.

**Cutout Match**
Players receive three [colored blocks](https://www.youtube.com/live/L7rBGepFrXA?si=E8tnJXeN4Tp4hmHt&t=4740) and must build a structure that matches the incoming wall’s hole pattern and color.

At the end, players face the true boss: **Stain King Chaos**, a battle riddled with RNG mechanics. In the final phase, a roulette wheel appears—higher accumulated luck increases the chance of landing on green. Winning this spin opens a cage containing a music disc.
