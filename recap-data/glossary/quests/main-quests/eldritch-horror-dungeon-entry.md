## Overview

**Day Unlocked**: 3

The Eldritch Horror Dungeon was housed within a haunted sanctum—its eerie, chilling atmosphere standing in stark contrast to the kind, sweet, and light-hearted priestess it was themed after: [Ninomae Ina’nis](#entry:ina-entry) of the Ancient Ones.

## Details

### Appearance

True to its name, the dungeon exuded a dark, gloomy, and otherworldly vibe. From the outside, it appeared as an isolated island hovering above an endless pool of water. The surface was scattered with torii gates and religious artifacts, evoking the feeling of a sacred yet forsaken ground. However, the trials themselves didn’t take place on this surface. Instead, the heroes were transported into enclosed wooden chambers, furnished with pots, bookshelves, and strange décor, where the first real challenges began.

### Puzzles

The objective was to free a trapped spirit by playing a series of “games,” each chosen by a mysterious soul guiding the trials. These puzzles operated under a sanity mechanic—sanity would gradually deplete over time, and if it reached zero, the afflicted hero would suffer permanent withering until death.

There were three main puzzles:

- **Pot Smashing**: Break the five correct [pots](https://www.youtube.com/live/N3v-MJXHQ0w?si=jWPSiUlHzjpY3R3E&t=3275) among a group, using the clues provided to identify them.
- **House Maze**: Navigate a confusing [maze](https://www.youtube.com/live/N3v-MJXHQ0w?si=7nPVVdHr_PtQeouW&t=3540) filled with deceptive doors to find the exit.
- **Lilies of the Valley**: Search various chests to collect [flowers](https://www.youtube.com/live/N3v-MJXHQ0w?si=2D9pH-3fNKE1RX3u&t=4573) known as _Lilies of the Valley_.
