## Overview

**Day Unlocked:** 7

The **Heart of Ruin** was the final dungeon—and the ultimate challenge the heroes faced in Chapter 2, as this was the source of all corruption, the root cause of the kingdom’s decay. Destroying it meant not only completing the mission for which the heroes were summoned, but also saving the world from ruin itself.

However, it quickly became clear that victory would come at a cost. Some of their comrades proved more vulnerable to the corruption than anyone had expected.

## Details

### Appearance

The dungeon’s atmosphere was oppressive and grim, resembling a massive, foreboding mansion. Dark and crimson red dominated the color palette, while curtains of lava bathed the space in an intimidating orange glow. The layout featured a vast library and multiple platform-like sections, all gradually leading toward a grand hall where the final boss awaited.

### Challenges

#### The Cursed Ones

Unlike the dungeons before it, the Heart of Ruin featured no puzzles or riddles.

The heroes began their journey in a darkened library, where a select few among them—**Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori**—were revealed to be [cursed](https://www.youtube.com/live/FlPFFE5_X3Y?si=X225RDkHgfG9S-lA&t=8877), having succumbed to the corruption. Twisted by its influence, they turned against the rest of the party, [hindering](https://www.youtube.com/live/FlPFFE5_X3Y?si=Y0CkESZCjPvnlNT4&t=9221) their progress and becoming obstacles along the path forward. The remaining heroes were tasked with purifying their friends.

Within this first library was a book titled _“Prelude of Ruin,”_ hinting at the events and powers that brought the kingdom to its current state.

Progressing onward, the heroes were thrown into a series of arenas where they fought off waves of Stains. Each victory built up **Purification Energy**. The goal was to fill this energy meter to cleanse their corrupted comrades. However, their progress was threatened by attacks and traps from their cursed allies, which drained the energy meter and delayed their rescue.

Only once the meter was filled could each corrupted hero [be freed](https://www.youtube.com/live/FlPFFE5_X3Y?si=gTrix4HT7CG7-0Xx&t=9250) and return to the group.

#### The Final Battle

Deeper into the dungeon, another library awaited. There, the heroes found the book titled _“Song of Ruin,”_ which detailed the tragic fate of the former Queen and the kingdom as well as the source behind their downfall.

Finally, at the end of the path, the heroes stood before their last enemy: **The Curse**—the very essence of corruption, the entity that had infected the kingdom and threatened to bring everything to its knees.

Defeating this entity meant liberation: of the land, the Princess, and the Outlander, who both offered their heartfelt gratitude after the battle.

> Here to destroy me? You don't even know what I am.
> I am the slow rot that spreads from within.
> I am the dark thought that won't go away.
> You think your kingdoms eternal? Your Heroes incorruptible?
> No... No... Nothing stays pure.
> I'll show you.

But this was not the end.
As the heroes would soon learn, the events on the final day would change everything.
This chapter had closed, but the story was far from over.
