## Overview

_Unlocked on:_ Day 6

"The Ritual" was a unique quest assigned to the heroes, deviating from their usual dungeon investigations. Their new task was to perform a "ritual" to purify a book essential for the next stage of their journey.

## Details

### Puzzle

The ritual was structured as a social deduction game. Each participant was assigned a number and a topic.

They had to devise a word that reflected the magnitude of their assigned number (small or large) to determine the correct seating order.

One participant was "Cursed" and sought to sabotage the purification without being discovered.

The ritual could be completed by either correctly seating everyone in numerical order or by identifying and voting out the Cursed individual.
