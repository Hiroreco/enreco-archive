## Overview

**The Library** was both a key concept and location in the heroes’ journey during the second chapter. It served not only as an archive of multiversal lore and the heroes’ memories throughout their time in Libestal, but also as the home of a significant figure: the Library’s caretaker, [Fia](#entry:iphania-entry).

## Details

### Preface

As the heroes faced off against the Outsider and watched the world around them crumble, Fia intervened. She pulled them back through time and transported them to the Library to save their lives. It was here that they first met Fia, the current Librarian, who explained their new objective: they needed to help her recover her lost memories—fragments lost due to the effects of time travel—in order to find a way to prevent the Outsider’s existence.

> _The Library Between Worlds is an archive of lore from across the multiverse. It moves freely through time and space, opening its doors wherever and whenever it pleases._

### Appearance and Role

The Library radiated a dreamy atmosphere, with a wooden interior intertwined with vines and greenery, lit warmly by lanterns and the ethereal glow of froglights. From the outside, it took the form of a dome with open entrances on all four sides, nestled within the kingdom’s walls.

At the heart of the Library stood a small quartz podium set atop a serene pool of water—Fia’s usual place of residence.

Most striking were the endless stacks of bookshelves lining the Library. True to its purpose, the Library housed [lore](https://www.youtube.com/live/5pgqtkxazUo?si=Avq9ghV6qktpwDi8&t=1123) from across the multiverse. Here, the heroes would also submit daily journal entries, as requested by Fia. Any newly discovered book or piece of lore would also be cataloged and made available for reading.

### Lore and Journals

Lore played a crucial role in the second chapter, uncovering the kingdom’s history, the rise of the Stains, and hidden truths that shaped the world. These pieces of lore were found throughout the heroes’ travels—from forgotten ruins to the depths of ancient dungeons.

**Book of Prophecies**
As described by the Princess, this book knew all and revealed all. It didn’t simply predict the future—it _defined_ it, including the doomed fate of Libestal.

### The Heroes' Journals

At the end of each day, the heroes were asked to record their experiences and submit them to the Library. In stark contrast to the heavy and often tragic tone of the other books, their entries were… quirky, to say the least.

_Note: You can read all of the heroes' entries in Chapter 2's charts._
