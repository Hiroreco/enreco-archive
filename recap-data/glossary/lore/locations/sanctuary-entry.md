## Overview

The Sanctuary remained a mystery in both meaning and purpose. It was the very first place where the heroes opened their eyes before their journeys began. It was also the site of the final battle between the heroes and the Captive in the first chapter.

## Details

### Appearance

Floating across what seemed like the fabric of space and time itself, the Sanctuary exuded a mythical, divine aura. It consisted of several large, round, disk-shaped platforms, each illuminated sparsely in its corners by glowing blue sea lanterns. One disk stood out among the rest—at its center stood a massive, egg-like artifact, encircled by towering beacons of light shooting endlessly into the void. This entire realm was surrounded by a sea of stars, drifting within a space so vast, cold, and silent that it felt like a realm fit for gods.

### Stories

As early as the heroes could remember, they awoke in this cold, mysterious place, greeted by an equally mysterious voice whispering directly into their minds. Whether these were their own thoughts or someone else’s, they couldn’t tell. The cryptic message it delivered only deepened the enigma:

> Faced with oblivion, I feel. Empty?
> Relieved?
> Perhaps distraught?
> I do not know.
> So much I don't know... And yet...
> That bright light... It calls to me...

After that, the heroes never returned to the Sanctuary—until the final day of the first chapter.

During the last battle, as the [Captive](#entry:outlander-entry) was defeated, the fabric of space began to unravel. In that moment, a mysterious voice—now revealed to be [Fia](#entry:iphania-entry)—urged the heroes to jump into a portal, leading them to the Library and marking the beginning of the second chapter.
