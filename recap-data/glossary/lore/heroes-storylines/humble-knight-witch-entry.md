## Overview

**Chapter:** 2
**Duration:** Day 1 to 7

[Gonathon](#entry:gigi-entry) found himself caught in another love story in Chapter 2—one far more bittersweet than before. This time, it was a tale that explored its characters with greater emotional depth, leaving many debating who was truly in the right… and who wasn’t.

## Details

### How it started

It all began when [Shiori](#entry:shiori-entry) sweet-talked Gonathon into buying her cooking. As straightforward as it gets—Shiori, knowing how gullible and easy to manipulate Gonathon was, took advantage of the humble knight for monetary gain.

But the more she saw his sincerity, the more her heart faltered. Eventually, she fell—deeply—for the kindhearted knight.

### How it went

Shiori had set her sights on Gonathon since Chapter 1, but back then, she didn’t have a chance—he was already betrothed. This time, with his memories of the previous journey gone, she saw her opportunity to step forward.

She cooked for him, made a room for him, and slowly—through every act of kindness and vulnerability—she began to hope. The way Gonathon treated her, the way he spoke, it was nothing like the selfish world she was used to. Perhaps, she thought, this was finally her happy sugar life.

> In a world where everyone is greedy and tries to rip money off of you, he is the one person who has not tried such a thing.

But Gonathon didn’t return her feelings in quite the same way. Always relying on others for decisions, never offering her the affection she hoped for—and as time passed, that distance became more and more apparent.

On the fourth day, when Shakira set up a blind date between Mordan and Gonathon, Shiori, not wanting their relationship to progress, pretended to drown herself in hopes of distracting the knight. But instead of rushing to her side… he stayed silent. It was Mordan who saved her.

Later, when she asked Gonathon if he wanted to move forward in their relationship, he hesitated—unsure, needing even his Queen, Tam, to weigh in and "monitor" their relationship. It was disheartening.

More and more, his weaknesses showed. He ignored her, didn’t listen, never gave her the attention she yearned for. He fumbled.

Maybe it was because someone else already held that space in his heart. Maybe this relationship was never meant to be.

Seeing it all fall apart—despite how much she had given, despite all her hope—Shiori made the painful decision to erase all memories of him. Perhaps to protect herself. Perhaps to protect him. It hurt them both, but they respected each other’s choice and parted ways.

### How it ended

With her memories gone, and Gonathon realizing what she’d done, the two sat together for one last conversation atop a waterfall. Gonathon apologized—realizing the hurt he caused—but would anything have changed, even if he knew? That, no one could say for certain.

> I wish I loved you the way I wanted to.

Shiori, even without the memories, could still feel something. Something warm. Something real.

> I can not recall... But I can feel it.

And with that, the two went their separate ways.

Yet with Shiori’s heel turn alongside others at the end of Chapter 2, this story may not be over—many now await Gonathon’s response to her unexpected betrayal.
