## Overview

**Chapter:** Chapter 2
**Duration:** Day 5

[Peasant the Bae](#entry:bae-entry) had countless storylines and moments that cemented her as someone with perhaps the most remarkable character growth in the kingdom. One such moment was the custody dispute with Koseki Bijou—over a child, with one acting as the adopted parent, and the other being the biological mother who had left it behind.

## Details

### How it started

At the end of the first chapter, Bijou left Shiori with a child—represented as a small Stain—after breaking up with her. The child, according to Bae, was later found abandoned and alone, prompting the kindhearted peasant to take it under her care. “Abandoned” as in: she won the Stain Hat from a gacha box.

Bijou, now wanting to mend her relationship with Shiori, attempted to persuade Bae to return the child, recognizing it as her own. Bae refused, and the matter was escalated to a “court” proceeding, with Mordon presiding as the jury.

### How it went

The court case went about as expected: chaotic. Bae stood firmly by her beliefs, having grown deeply attached to the child—to the point she saw it as her own. She argued that Bijou was neglectful and irresponsible, and the child deserved a loving, stable home.

Bijou, lacking a solid rebuttal, claimed she only wanted the child because she thought it would make Shiori happy. The catch? Shiori didn’t even want the child to begin with.

The court session dragged on until the judge, overwhelmed with a headache, decided to finally reach a conclusion.

### How it ended

Thanks to Bae’s unrelenting dedication and genuine care for the child, the case ended in her favor. Bae was granted full custody, while Bijou received visitation rights.
