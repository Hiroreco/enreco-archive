## Overview

**Chapter:** 2
**Duration:** Day 1 to 8

One of the more prominent relationships that first bloomed in Chapter 1 was between [Elizabeth](#entry:liz-entry) and [Nerissa](#entry:nerissa-entry). Back then, their bond was a funny, wholesome one—marked by banter (or was it bickering?)—with Nerissa as the tease and Elizabeth as the straight-laced knight. However, in Chapter 2, that relationship deepened, blossoming into something far more complex.

## Details

### How it started

Nerissa began the second journey with no memories of the previous one, meaning she didn’t remember who Elizabeth was either. But over time, those memories slowly returned—and with them, the bond they had forged before. This time, it was stronger. The two could feel it: there was something between them.

### How it went

Nerissa began to seek Elizabeth’s company more and more. They sparred, exchanged gifts, placed their portraits side by side, and even lived under the same roof. Elizabeth didn’t shy away; she smiled, reciprocated, and seemed to genuinely enjoy Nerissa’s presence. Even calling her a “witch” now had a playful warmth to it.

They hung each other's portraits beside one another—as if to symbolize the growing closeness between them.

But on the fifth day, a misunderstanding unraveled that progress. Nerissa noticed Elizabeth’s portrait was no longer next to hers, and when she asked about it, Elizabeth responded coldly, returning to calling her “witch” with a sharper tone. In truth, Elizabeth hadn’t meant anything by it—she was simply being her usual self, oblivious to how her actions could be taken—but to Nerissa, it felt like a dagger to the heart.

It stirred something in her. A painful clarity. Just how important Elizabeth was to her.

Even after the misunderstanding was cleared up, Nerissa’s fixation only deepened. Her tone softened around Elizabeth, her gaze never left her, and her thoughts were consumed by her. She wanted Elizabeth—fully, completely. It was as if a sea of blue had begun closing in on a delicate red flame. A chilling, possessive aura surrounded Nerissa. She would never forget Elizabeth again. She wouldn’t allow herself to.

She even built a shrine beneath her house, close to Elizabeth’s home, where mythical music played around the clock—perhaps in hopes of luring the red knight to her side. Even Roa, someone who also had feelings for Elizabeth, sensed the growing danger whenever Nerissa was near.

### How it ended

What was once a fond bond slowly twisted into obsession. By the final day, Nerissa could think of nothing but Elizabeth. She didn’t just want her affection—she wanted Elizabeth's whole heart, her entire attention. No distractions. No rivals.

> Her lips gently parted and sang out a tune
> I moved like the tide, being pulled toward the moon
> Her song sweet as honey, it lowered my defenses
> and before I knew it, she engulfed all my senses
> It mattered not what she intended to do
> I entrusted my fate to the maven in blue

As Nerissa, alongside four others, turned against Fia and the other heroes, this storyline was left on a cliffhanger—with many eager (and anxious) to see how Elizabeth would react to Nerissa’s chilling descent.
