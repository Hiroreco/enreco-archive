## Overview

**Chapter:** Chapter 2
**Duration:** Day 4 to 7

[Fuwawa](#entry:fuwawa-entry) was a humble, hard-working chef who dreamed of bringing smiles to others through delicious food. Though her dream began with hardship and quiet disappointment, it blossomed into a rare, heartwarming story—arguably the only one of its kind in the entire kingdom.

## Details

### How it started

From the very beginning, Fuwawa chose the path of a chef. Her goal was clear: to build a small café in the center of town, where passersby could stop in and enjoy warm, lovingly prepared meals. With that vision in mind, she threw herself into the work—gathering ingredients, cooking dishes, and constructing the café all by herself.

Her determination was unwavering, but so intense that she became detached from the rest of the kingdom’s chaos. For better or worse, she kept her distance from the shenanigans of others, and as a result, her journey felt somewhat lonely.

On Day 4, while going about her usual work, she spotted a wandering chicken near her café. The sight reminded her of her first journey, when she had cared for flocks of her own. Feeling nostalgic, she took the chicken in as a companion and named it **Moco-chan**.

It was adorable. It kept her company. And she loved it with all her heart.

But the joy didn’t last. Not long after, Moco-chan vanished without a trace. Fuwawa searched high and low, but the little chicken was gone.

Heartbroken, she looked back at her café—silent, empty, and still without a single customer after four days.

Her heart sank. Disappointment crept in.

She began to lose hope.

### How it went

Just as despair was settling in, **Kiara** noticed the struggling chef. Without hesitation, the kindhearted phoenix bought every dish Fuwawa had to offer, giving her the first real boost she needed.

That single act of kindness set off a chain reaction. Word spread. One customer turned into two, then many more. Fuwawa’s food was finally getting the love it deserved.

Upon realizing what was happening, Fuwawa was overjoyed.

### How it ended

By Day 7, Fuwawa’s café was thriving. Her food had become so beloved that she was even commissioned to prepare meals for a kingdom-wide party.

Even though the event itself turned out chaotic, her dream had been fulfilled.

And she was happy.
