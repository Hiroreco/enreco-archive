## Overview

**Chapter:** Chapter 1
**Duration:** Day 6 to 8

One of the most talked-about stories in the first chapter was the love story between [Gonathon](#entry:gigi-entry) and [Amelia Watson](#entry:ame-entry). It left an imprint on this enigmatic journey that lasted well beyond its time.

## Details

### How it started

Their relationship began on shaky ground. Amelia was convinced the King was evil and plotting an assassination, while Gonathon, ever loyal, stood firmly by the King’s side. This [put them at odds](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?t=5967), with Gonathon determined to bring Amelia to justice.

However, through moments of understanding and generous gifts of diamonds, the two grew close and eventually entered into matrimony on the second day.

### How it went

Gonathon proved to be a devoted husband, doing everything he could to keep Amelia, his “Pearl,” safe and happy. Amelia, of course, remained thoroughly herself. The humble knight would fetch her money and rush to her side at the slightest hint of danger, and there was no shortage of “danger” headed her way. Gura, Bijou, Nerissa, and most notably the Hot Pink One, frequently teased the knight by pretending to steal his wife. Though in the Hot Pink One’s case, she wasn’t pretending.

He was a humble and just knight through and through. He helped others, showed kindness at every turn, and his love for his wife was purer than anything.

Their tale seemed destined for a happy ending, until the sixth day, when Amelia regained her past memories after conquering the Ancient Sewers Dungeon—and forgot everything about Gonathon.

Heartbroken, the humble knight still chose to support her, wishing for nothing but her happiness.

### How it ended

On the final day, as the battle against the Corruption loomed, Amelia—guided by others and the faint imprint Gonathon had left in her heart—began desperately searching for what she had lost. A “diamond” buried deep within her, someone dear and nearly remembered.

This desperation led her into the arms of the Hot Pink One, who [tried to deceive her](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=8758) into thinking _she_ was the one Amelia had been searching for. The scene sparked tension and left many spectators displeased. Thankfully, Amelia saw through the ruse, rejected the Hot Pink One’s hand, and followed her heart.

> And the pearl will remember.
> And she will want.
> And she will wish.

In the end, with unwavering loyalty and love, Amelia and Gonathon reunited at the kingdom’s onsen. There, the two [confessed their feelings](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=10312) once more. And although her memories hadn't returned, Amelia chose to take the knight’s hand—ready to forge new ones together.
