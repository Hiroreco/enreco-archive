## Overview

**Chapter:** 1
**Duration:** Day 7 to 8

The final major saga of Chapter 1—and a fitting climax—was the battle against the Corruption. Twists and turns, emotional highs and lows, and an unexpectedly deep and gripping story elevated this wild journey beyond mere silliness, turning it into something far more compelling.

## Details

### How it started

It all began when [Koseki Bijou](#entry:bijou-entry) spent tens of thousands of coins trying to obtain a hat, eventually acquiring the **Stain Hat**. But this wasn’t just any cosmetic item—it was sentient, a fragment of Corruption that slowly began to possess its wearer, twisting their thoughts toward chaos and destruction.

### How it went

At first, Bijou seemed fine. But by the sixth day, signs of corruption began to surface—wasted lands, cryptic messages, griefing, and crop destruction. Many tried to stop her, but could do little more than watch as she laid waste to the realm.

By Day 7, Bijou was fully corrupted. Worse still, she began spreading the Corruption by gifting hats to others.

> FIRE FIRE, LIGHT THE FIRE!
> MAY THE LANDS BURN!

She ordered Mococo to slaughter innocent [chickens.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFnAgJtQtiY?si=I8pw4o1eeG_aDK5a&start=12974) Then, with power growing, she passed hats to Fuwawa, Nerissa, and Shiori. Darkness and gloom crept over the kingdom. The corrupted ruled one side, while those still untouched tried desperately to resist, searching for a way to end the madness.

It became a battle of former friends, allies, and family. Mococo was [heartbroken](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?si=xxB_sQ9KhDy7UMnv&t=1608) to see Elizabeth glaring at her with anger and disappointment. Ina and Raora were crushed to witness Bijou—Ina's sister, Raora's daughter—descend into evil.

Tensions rose. Trust was broken.

> You wish to call me sister now? I watched you corrupt the lands!

But then came hope: the **Essence of Empathy**—a potential cure that Ina vaguely remembered, and one that Cecilia had more concrete knowledge of. With her guidance, and through the combined efforts of music, clever planning, and a talented tavern owner who managed to brew the potion, they set the [stage.](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?si=ldRQcihdPK3M_hZn&t=12403) Using a strategic performance, they lured the corrupted in, one by one, until all but one were cured.

Bijou.

She knew what the drink was. And with her allies gone, she had no one left. But instead of surrendering, she issued a challenge to Ina:

> If I win, you would have to wear this hat.
> If you win... I would drink whatever this is.

### How it ended

The duel commenced—sister versus sister. A fierce clash. But with only half a heart remaining, Ina emerged victorious.

Standing atop her Moai statue, surrounded by friends, family, and the uncorrupted, Bijou finally relented. She drank the Essence of Empathy—and the Corruption was [no more.](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=12247)
