## Overview

**Chapter:** 1
**Duration:** Day 2 to 8

Out of the many questionable relationships in Chapter 1, the one between [Elizabeth](#entry:liz-entry) and [Nerissa](#entry:nerissa-entry) stood out—not only for its consistency amidst twists and turns, but also for the emotional longevity it promised. What began here was only the beginning of a story expected to last until the journey’s end.

## Details

### How it started

Elizabeth struggled to adjust to her new life in Libestal. The confusing mechanics, the chaotic personalities surrounding her, and the sheer absurdity of it all overwhelmed the scarlet knight—especially for someone whose only goal was to fulfill her duty and serve her king. Everything made her head spin.

But amid the madness, one person stood out: Nerissa Ravencroft. What began as a simple, friendly conversation quickly sparked the beginnings of something more—a connection Elizabeth didn’t expect but couldn’t deny.

### How it went

Their dynamic couldn’t have been more distinct. Elizabeth played the straight-laced, logical one, while Nerissa thrived as the mischievous wildcard. At first, Elizabeth couldn’t comprehend why Nerissa’s presence made her heart race, her cheeks flush a [strawberry shade,](https://www.youtube.com/live/oVguNTPnDww?t=820) and her words stumble. Desperate to rationalize it, she labeled Nerissa a "witch"—one who’d hexed her with some kind of spell.

Nerissa, of course, delighted in every flustered reaction. Every chance she got, she teased Elizabeth, dropping charming compliments, making sly remarks, doing anything to bring out that iconic red hue on her face.

> I see, so you just want to look at me, huh~
> Y-yes, to monitor you. Well of course you have a nice face, but that’s because you used your witch powers!

No matter how hard Elizabeth tried to deny it, her heart always betrayed her. On the fourth day, during the infamous [Lottery Fiasco](#entry:lottery-fiasco-entry), when Nerissa and Gonathon were trying to get information about the fugitive Mococo, Gonathon jokingly asked Nerissa to say she hated Elizabeth.

Those words shattered Elizabeth’s composure. The mere thought of being hated by Nerissa caused her to completely lose her usual knightly demeanor, leading to quite the emotional outburst. Later, Nerissa clarified that she hadn’t meant it, and the [misunderstanding](https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?si=OCYF7bUx3zTLXPnC&start=1127) was resolved.

From there, the bond between them only deepened—or rather, the antics intensified. Nerissa’s teasing became even more relentless. At one point, she even claimed she was pregnant with Elizabeth’s child just to get a reaction out of her.

But no matter how many headaches the blue menace caused, Elizabeth cared deeply for her. That much was clear—even in the most dangerous of situations.

### How it ended

On the final day of Chapter 1, when the corruption was at its peak, Nerissa succumbed to it.

But instead of pushing her away, Elizabeth—despite her deep hatred for the corruption and the danger it posed—remained calm. She took Nerissa’s hand, and [saved her.](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=12224)

Before this took place, Elizabeth and Nerissa had a heated argument. Nerissa, ever skeptical and sharp-eyed, tried to convince the scarlet knight that the King, the very one Elizabeth had sworn loyalty to, might not be as righteous as he seemed. That he could be manipulating everyone from the shadows.

To Elizabeth, this was nothing short of [blasphemy.](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=6832) Her faith in the King was unwavering, and the idea that he could be anything but noble infuriated her. She nearly came to resent Nerissa for daring to say such things.

Yet, when the time came—despite the anger, despite the doubts, despite the emotional distance that argument had carved between them—Elizabeth saved her anyway.

Maybe it was simply her duty as a knight. Maybe she was just saving someone in need. But deep down, it meant more—it always did. To save the one who stirred such feelings in her, to protect someone who tugged at her heart in ways she couldn't explain, meant everything.

This was the beginning of something special—a bond destined to carry on through the chapters ahead.
