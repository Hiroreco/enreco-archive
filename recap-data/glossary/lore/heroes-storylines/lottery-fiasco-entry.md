## Overview

**Chapter:** 1
**Duration:** Day 4 to 5

A dog with a gambling addiction, an alarming thirst for money, a willingness to commit violence, sharp pink claws, and a lottery business that caught her in the wrong mood. Not the greatest combo, huh?

## Details

### How it started

Among FaunaMart’s once most loyal customers was [Mococo](#entry:mococo-entry). It began with just a few tickets… then spiraled into dozens… then hundreds. She became hopelessly addicted to gambling. Every waking moment of the fuzzy one’s life revolved around two things: lottery and money.

On Day 4, as she went through her usual morning routine—buying an absurd number of tickets and burning through her savings—she encountered an unexpected face. Fauna wasn’t at the checkout like usual. Instead, standing there was Nerissa, the store’s new (and only) employee. And with that, the stage for chaos was set.

### How it went

Mococo—whether she forgot, was confused, or more likely, was trying to take advantage of the newbie—asked Nerissa to hand over her “winnings,” even though she hadn’t won anything in the last drawing. Nerissa, unsure and cautious, refused.

That’s when the tantrum started.

Mococo challenged Nerissa to a duel. And not only did she win, she also demanded money from Nerissa as a consequence—something that was never agreed upon in the duel to begin with, but whatever.

Nerissa, perhaps too kind (or too scared), gave Mococo **3,000 coins**, which Mococo immediately spent—on lottery tickets again, of course.

Now, 3,000 coins at 10 coins per ticket should get you 300 tickets. But Nerissa, being _mathematically challenged_, somehow handed her **680**. Mococo noticed the mistake right away… but said nothing. Because obviously, why would she?

Later, Nerissa realized her error and tried to apologize, offering to fix things. But Mococo wasn’t having any of it. She wanted her 680 tickets, end of story. Fearing for her safety, Nerissa sought protection, asking Gonathon and others to help, labeling Mococo a criminal.

A chase ensued. Gonathon and the others tried to talk things through, but Mococo, panicked and fearing retaliation, fled. In the process, she got hurt (mostly self-inflicted) and fell into emotional turmoil.

The next day, the fuzzy dog marched back to FaunaMart, determined to confront Fauna herself for all the pain they caused her. In short, she tried to **sue them**.

But poor Mococo stood alone—only Cecilia served as her “lawyer.” Meanwhile, FaunaMart had Fauna, Nerissa… and Cecilia as well. The odds were stacked heavily against her, and truth be told, FaunaMart had every right while Mococo had almost every wrong.

Mococo demanded **10,000 gold** in compensation for her emotional damage. Fauna refused. Onlookers gathered, pressure mounted, and eventually, Mococo realized she couldn’t win. So, she ran.

### How it ended

Feeling bad for the fuzzy one and just wanting to end the whole ordeal, Fauna later called Mococo over and agreed to settle the matter. She paid the dog a generous sum of 10,000 gold… along with some kisses.

And just like that, they were friends again.
Hurray.
