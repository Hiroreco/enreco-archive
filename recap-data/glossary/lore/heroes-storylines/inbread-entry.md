## Overview

**Chapter:** Chapter 2
**Duration:** Day 3

Perhaps the strangest storyline of all was the “In-bread Incident,” more infamously known as _“The Libestal Incest Situation Is Crazy.”_ A theory so questionable and convoluted, it made the entire kingdom erupt—and gave everyone a collective headache just trying to comprehend it.

## Details

### How it started

It all began when Shakira asked Gonathon to help her pursue Immerkind—her _cousin_. Unfortunately for her, Immerkind was already in love with the Princess. But upon learning that the Princess only had eyes for the Outlander, Immerkind was left devastated.

In an attempt to console her, Gonathon offered a wild theory:

> "What if… the Princess and the Outlander are siblings?"

### How it went

The rumor spread fast—Nerissa, Tam, and countless other curious ears quickly caught wind of it. Among them was Peasant the Bae, who took the theory to a whole new level, concluding that _everyone_ in the kingdom must be inbred… because, according to him, everyone looked alike.

From there, it escalated.

The Hot Pink One, Bijou, Roa—they all joined in on the discussion. The theory turned into a cult. The cult started recruiting. And suddenly, a joke theory spiraled into a kingdom-wide conspiracy movement.

### How it ended

It… ended.
Somehow.

What even _was_ this storyline, man.
