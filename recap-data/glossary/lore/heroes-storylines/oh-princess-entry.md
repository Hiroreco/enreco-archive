## Overview

**Chapter:** 2
**Duration:** Day 1 to 8

Cecilia Immerkind, in her previous journey during the first chapter, served as a knight to a "princess", Princess Koseki Bijou. In this second journey, she once again pledged herself to a princess. But this time, it wasn't out of manipulation or self-interest. This time, it was driven by something far more pure and powerful: love.

## Details

### How it started

At her first meeting with [Princess Iphania,](#entry:iphania-entry) the ancient-era princess of Libestal, Cecilia was [awestruck.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyLsX20esBE&t=3677s) “She’s so cute,” “She’s so pretty,” were the thoughts that echoed through the green-haired knight’s mind the moment she laid eyes on the rabbit-like maiden. From that moment on, she swore to herself—and to the princess—that she would be her knight, her “Shining Star.” A loyal protector, and at the same time, a maiden in love.

> Princess! I bow to you.
> Maybe if I can prove my worth, I can be with you forever!

### How it went

Every waking moment for Cecilia revolved around Iphania. Every quest, every mission, every task was done with duty and devotion, all in hopes of winning the maiden’s heart. Though her affection occasionally veered into [obsession](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?si=Jyrns6hejyLxwP1j&t=18262) (such as sneaking into Iphania’s room to leave behind love letters… and sniffing her still-warm bed), her feelings remained sincere.

Freakiness aside, things seemed to be looking up for the green knight. Never before had she felt such purpose, never had her life felt so meaningful.

But like any love story, obstacles soon emerged. By the third day of her pursuit, Cecilia noticed that Iphania kept bringing up someone else: the [Outlander](#entry:outsider-entry). Not only did she speak of him often, she did so with admiration and warmth. This shook Cecilia to her core. Her heart [fractured,](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?si=ExxsS-YVaBvPL6Uo&t=5066) and despair nearly pushed her to give up.

Fortunately, her comrades, mainly [Gonathon,](#entry:gigi-entry) were there to support her, even if their “support” involved spinning a bizarre theory that Iphania and the Outlander might be siblings. It wasn’t true, of course, but it bought Cecilia a sliver of hope.

As time passed, she gathered the courage to confess. And she did it in the most romantic way she knew: through a heartfelt [serenade.](https://www.youtube.com/live/I75IWfMGVgM?t=7144) As always, the Princess gave no direct response—but even then, Cecilia’s resolve did not waver.

So firm was her love that she was willing to stay behind with Iphania forever, letting her friends continue without her. So emotionally driven that anyone who dared to badmouth Iphania, even [unintentionally,](https://www.youtube.com/live/48HSA_GcOZ0?si=5hds-8Kg9slqsnyV&t=6918) would face her swift judgment. So steadfast was her devotion that when someone else—specifically [Peasant the Bae](#entry:bae-entry)—confessed their love to her, Cecilia gently turned them down.

Her heart, after all, only beat for one. Even if the Princess never returned her feelings, Cecilia promised she would protect her all the same.

> Oh Princess, I would do anything for you.
> May your future shine anew.

### How it ended

On the final day, as the kingdom prepared to celebrate their victory over the Ruination, tragedy struck.

Iphania was murdered. And Cecilia was [devastated.](https://www.youtube.com/live/LyufI3aiCB0?si=GTfSsdxPIM8QPDg9&t=6682)

But shortly after, the truth was revealed—Iphania’s soul had not vanished. It now resided as someone known as Fia, the plushie-bodied guide who had led them through their entire journey. She continued to exist, even if in a different form.

Knowing this, Cecilia’s vow remained unchanged. Even if her princess now lived inside a small, stuffed vessel, as long as her soul endured, the green knight would protect her.

Thus ended this chapter of a love story.
Will it continue? Only time will tell.
