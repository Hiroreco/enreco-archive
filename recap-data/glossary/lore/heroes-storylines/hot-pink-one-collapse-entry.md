## Overview

**Chapter:** 2
**Duration:** Day 5 to 8

[The Hot Pink One](#entry:irys-entry) had long been known for her tangled affairs with circles of women. Once again, she found herself at the center of complicated romantic drama in Chapter 2. However, unlike the more lighthearted chaos of Chapter 1, this time the drama would spiral into something no one saw coming.

## Details

### How it started

At the beginning of the second journey, the Hot Pink One was once again engaged to her eternal consort, NinoIna. But true to her playful nature from the previous chapter, she quickly found herself in yet another affectionate entanglement—this time with [Tam Gandr](#entry:kronii-entry).

At first, the trio embraced a polygamous dynamic. [NinoIna](#entry:ina-entry) loved the Hot Pink One, and the Hot Pink One and Tam exchanged witty banter and pet names—“Tammy” and “Pinky.” It was going well… for a few days.

### How it went

Around Day 5, the Hot Pink One discovered that Tam had been secretly involved in a separate “affair” with another woman, **Roa Pandora**. To save face as Queen, Tam begged her not to reveal the news, promising to do _anything_ in return.

Seizing the opportunity, the Hot Pink One ordered Tam to serve as her maid—and proceeded to humiliate her in front of others: her knight, her friends, everyone. Their relationship began to visibly crack.

To twist the knife further, the Hot Pink One revealed that she was pregnant—with Ina’s child. Tam was stunned and heartbroken, but she kept her emotions bottled up, trying desperately to keep the relationship intact, even as the Pink One continued to exploit her.

By Day 7, Tam and others held a **gender reveal party** for the unborn child. Still bitter, Tam tried to keep it together, until Pinky asked her to be the child’s **godfather**. That was the [last straw.](https://www.youtube.com/live/CUh9eciJil4?t=7701)

> You sick… you sicken me. You sick woman.
> Back off, you monster!...Can you believe the audacity of that woman.

Tam finally snapped. Tired of being treated like a “hobby,” she cut ties with the Hot Pink One completely. In a bitter act of revenge, she turned her attention toward **Ina**, attempting to steal her away.

Surprisingly, it worked. The mounting pressure—of a child, of the drama—caused Ina’s feelings to waver. At one point, she even considered Tam’s proposition.

Everything began to fall apart for the Hot Pink One.

### How it ended

In the end, as all the drama came crashing down, the Hot Pink One was left alone. Tam insulted her every time they met, refusing to have anything to do with her. And Ina?

She left a letter—saying it had all become too much. That she needed to reflect, to repent. And so she left, embarking on a journey of enlightenment.

The Hot Pink One stood in the ruins of her own making.
