## Overview

**Chapter:** Chapter 1
**Duration:** Day 2 to 8

Capitalism, gambling, scamming, things you'd never expect in a kingdom of fantastical wonder and a supposedly heroic tale. And yet, they existed. They were the talk of the realm. And at the heart of it all stood one green entrepreneur and one brown entrepreneur.

## Details

### How it started

By Day 2, [Fauna](#entry:fauna-entry) had decided she’d rather live like an NPC than get involved in all the hero business. So she opened **FaunaMart**, a [convenience store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUQWfgVwwpo&t=176s) selling everyday goods and, most notably, [FaunaMart Lottery tickets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2JxBxhda9I&t=249s)—which she claimed would fund a library for the kingdom.

### How it went

The store quickly became the buzz of the kingdom. From the moment it opened, curious faces wandered in. Some bought goods, but most were drawn in by the prospect of the lottery. The only reason it attracted so many customers so quickly was because of Fauna’s relentless promotion—either through global announcements or by quite literally speaking into people’s minds.

While many suspected a scam, some did win, and others lost. But regardless of the outcome, the CEO remained steadfast in growing her empire. FaunaMart’s very first customer, [Nanamoo](#entry:mumei-entry), however, wasn’t one to idly watch Fauna potentially scam others with her _questionable_ business practices. By Day 7, she launched a rival store—**NanaEleven**—complete with its own lottery (which also scammed people).

### How it ended

Upon hearing of this new competition, Fauna was having none of it. She was aiming for monopoly status, and no one would be allowed to snatch even a slice of the pie.

The rivalry reached its peak on the final day when Fauna [invited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x-MVX8h9gU&t=1082s) Nanamoo to FaunaMart for a head-to-head confrontation. In a shocking move, Fauna offered 50,000 gold to buy out NanaEleven.

Nanamoo rejected the offer—insulting Fauna in the process. But then came the twist: Nanamoo revealed she had been working _for_ FaunaMart all along. Everything she did—the funds, the revenue, the creation of NanaEleven—was to attract even more attention to FaunaMart.

> Oh it hurts me, to see such bad business practices.
> You see, it was so obvious that you were trying to scam people.

What started as a corporate standoff ended in laughter, as the two agreed to merge their businesses and take over the world together, united as **FaunaMart x NanaEleven**.
