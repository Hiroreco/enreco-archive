## Overview

Revelations were special powers and weapons unique to each hero, shaped by their personalities and the stories that defined them before their memories were lost.

## Details

### Preface

During the first battle against the Stain King, the heroes manifested mysterious powers upon shouting the word _"Revelation."_ These powers enabled them to repel the great evil. The [King of Libestal](#entry:outlander-entry) proclaimed that these Revelations were the key to saving the world from the Calamity, and urged the heroes to lend their strength in doing so.

### Abilities

Each Revelation possessed a unique ability, ranging from blazing projectiles to gem-like bursts. After activation, abilities entered a cooldown phase of one minute before they could be used again.

With each dungeon conquered, the heroes’ Revelations grew stronger, a change marked visually by increasingly brilliant sparkles surrounding the weapon.

In Chapter 2, Revelations received a significant upgrade. Not only were their powers enhanced, but they could also be wielded as melee weapons—unlike in Chapter 1, where they functioned purely as activated abilities. Additionally, each Revelation gained a basic ranged attack that could be used repeatedly without cooldown.
