## Overview

**The Kingdom of Libestal** was where the heroes were first summoned by the King, marking the beginning of their enigmatic journey. They were brought forth with the objective of defending the kingdom from a mysterious threat known as the Stains. However, it was later revealed that the kingdom itself was a fabrication—a guise for a prison holding the King, whose true identity was The Captive (the Outsider). In a grand deception, the Captive had tricked the heroes into releasing him.

## Details

### Preface

Nineteen heroes were summoned to a mysterious kingdom by its King, each stripped of their memories. Recognizing them as the destined saviors foretold by the power of their Revelation, the King urged them to grow stronger and unite in order to defeat the looming threat of the Stain King—and, in doing so, save the kingdom.

### Setting

Libestal was set in a somewhat medieval—though not archaic—fantasy world. Magical devices and enchanted weaponry were commonplace. The kingdom’s citizens, known as Libestans, were rabbit-like humanoids, and the realm was ruled by the King. Four guilds served as pillars of the kingdom’s structure, each tasked with different duties, and the heroes were assigned to one of them:

- **Jade Sword** – A beacon of righteousness and loyalty, where great threats are met with even greater courage.
- **Cerulean Cup** – A sanctum of healing, where empathy and devotion flourish.
- **Amber Coin** – A haven for glory-seekers and visionaries, where the closest allies could become the fiercest rivals.
- **Scarlet Wand** – A refuge for the curious, where knowledge and creativity are held above all else.

Despite the kingdom’s scale, many heroes remarked on how empty it felt—its vast size contrasting with its sparse population.

### Appearance

The kingdom was vast and diverse in its architecture, with clear distinctions between major and minor structures. It could be divided into four key zones:

- **Guild Headquarters** – Each guild’s headquarters housed its respective guild master and reflected their philosophy. For example, Jade Sword’s area included dueling arenas, while Amber Coin featured a casino.

- **Free Build Area** – A sandbox-like zone where heroes could build shops, homes, or anything else they desired. This area was subdivided by guild, with each guild’s members allotted specific land plots. Building heights and depths were restricted, and heroes could only fly and construct within their assigned territory.

- **The Castle** – The largest structure in the kingdom and the King’s residence. Constructed mainly from quartz, the Castle had a clean, bright, and grand appearance. Despite its imposing architecture, many of its halls were eerily empty—only the throne room saw consistent use.

- **Miscellaneous Areas** – Additional zones included gardens, shopping buildings, and residential structures for the kingdom's occupants.

Within the kingdom’s walls, the environment was safe. Outside lay the wilderness, teeming with Stains, materials, and dungeons for the heroes to explore.

### Quests

Heroes advanced through the story via two types of quests:

- **Side Quests** – Routine tasks such as cooking or gathering resources. Completing these quests rewarded coins and useful artifacts. They were repeatable and served as a way to gain materials and build up strength.

- **Main Quests** – Essential story-driven objectives, focused mainly on conquering five dungeons. Each completed main quest restored a portion of the heroes’ lost memories and strengthened their Revelation. Dungeons were unlocked progressively each day.

### Plot Twist and Demise

After defeating the Stain King on Day 8, the truth unraveled: the King had been evil all along. The kingdom was merely a prison to contain him, and the heroes had unknowingly set him free. His true identity—The Captive, or The Outsider—was revealed, and his release brought the fabricated world to its breaking point. Though the heroes ultimately defeated the Captive, the world itself began to collapse, disintegrating back into the void.

Only through the intervention of a mysterious being were the heroes rescued, leading directly into the events of Chapter 2.
