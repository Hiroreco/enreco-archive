## Overview

Besides the main storylines within the ENreco universe, there were also a multitude of self-made shenanigans made by the heroes themselves, which made it a massive headache for many to try to keep track of all. This entry will serve as a very brief summary for all the major storylines, both official and self-made ones, sotred in somewhat chronological order.

_Note: These only serve as very short summaaries to help get the general idea. For more details, read the recaps or check out the related glossary entries_

## Official Stories

These are stories that played out the same for everyone, the main storylines of this enigmatic journey.

### Chapter 1

Nineteen heroes were summoned to the Kingdom of Libestal by its King, all of which had lost their memories and were asked by the King to save his kingdom from the Stains. With their powers known as Revelation, they venture through, conquering dungeons, with each conquer recovering parts of their missing memories of others and strengthening them along the way. At the end, they faced the final challenge being the Stain King, to which they succeeded in defeating the it, accomplising their goal of saving the kingdom.

However, it turned out the King had tricked them, as he revealed to be the actual evil mastermind behind it all. Defeating the Stain King meant freeing the fake King from his prison, revealing his identity as the Captive, which wanted to destroy the universe.

The heroes, however, managed to stop that plan, but with the Captive defeated, the world itself crumbled, then a mysterious voice rung out pleading the heroes to jump into a portal, marking the end of Chapter 1.

### Chapter 2

The pleading voice at the end of Chapter 1 was from Fia, the keeper of the Library. She brought the heroes back in time to Ancient Libestal, in order to stop the evil being, the Outsider (called the Captive in Chapter 1), otherwise revealed as the fake King that had tricked the heroes, from coming into being, as he would destroy the universe itself.

In order to figure out how to do so, they must first recover Fia's missing memories, through conquering Star Sites. During their journey, they were greeted by Iphania, the kingdom's princess, and the Outlander, a mysterious swordsman. From the recovered memories did they find out the Outlander would later turn into the Outsider in his attempt to save the current world ravaged by the Stains.

So Fia asked the heroes to save the world in his place instead, by destroying the source of the corruption, the Curse. They succeeded, but not really, as the Curse somehow survived, coming back to slay both the Princess, and have a mysterious being punish the Outlander and the heores for trying to defy fate.

Fia chimed in last minute again to save the heroes, and realizing they couldn't change the past, they can only try to change the present and the future. She asked for the heroes' help again, though majority lend their hands, five rejected.

Those five being Bijou, Mococo, Fuwawa, Nerissa and Shiori, rebelling and forging their own path instead.

## Self-made Stories

These stories were spontaneously generated from the interaction of the quirky heroes, they do not have any connection to the main storylines whatsoever. Note that this only covers most notable events, as well as ones that persist through out many chapters, playing a major role in shaping ENreco in general.

### Chapter 1

#### FaunaMart and NanaEleven

As early as day 2, Fauna decided she would start her life as an NPC instead of fulfilling all this silly hero stuff. She did so by opening a store called FaunaMart, a convenience store that sold common goods, as well as the most coveted item of all, the FaunaMart lottery tickets, with the funds claim to be going towards building a library for the kingdom.

These tickets became the talk of the kingdom, with many speculating it being a scam. One of these speculators was FaunaMart's first customer, Nanamoo. The owl one was most sketchy of FuanaMart's business practices, and she couldn't just stand and do nothing. So she decided to open a rivaling business of her own, called Nanamoo, which had a lottery system of its own on day 7... which also scammed people.

The two CEOs confronted each other on the final day, though the confrontation started off tense with rivalry, it ended with the two merging their businesses, shaking hands on cooperating with each other.

#### Lottery Fiasco

One of FaunaMart's most loyal, well, once most loyal, customers was Mococo. It all started with a few tickets, those few slowly grew to tens, then hundreds as the fuzzy one became addicted with the prospect of gambling. Her hunger for money led her to even threatening the poor employee of FaunaMart, Nerissa, to the point off inflicintg violence with her sharp claws just because Nerissa wasn't giving her the money which she wrongfully was trying to get in the first place.

The conflict escalated as Mococo threanted to sue FaunaMart for "improper business". But of course, all odds were stacked against the small fuzzy, as pretty much everyone in the kingdom deemed her to be the guilty one.

Despite that, she still managed to "win" in the end, as Nerissa paid her a generous-sum of money to settle the conflict.

#### A Knight's Tale

Probably one of the most talked about story in the first chapter was the love story between Gonathon and Amelia Watson, a story that left an ever-lasting impact on this enigmatic journey, and has not faded out ever since it happened.

The two started heroes in topic started off on the rocky side, then managed to get into a matrmony after a generous gift of diamonds and understanding of each other. Gonathon was the loving husband, doing everything in his ability to keep his wife, or Pearl, safe and happy. Amelia was.... Amelia.

The two lovey-dovey's story was thought to be a lasting happy one, until on the sixth day, when Amelia recovered memories of her past self, she also forgot the memories she'd spent with Gonathon. But despite the heartbreak, Gonathon pressed on, believing in whichever path Amelia chose, as he only wished for her happiness.

In the end, through all the hardships, roughs and stones, the humble knight's conviction and ever-loyal demenour were rewarded. As Amelia's lingering image of the knight within her heart, as well as the help of others, the two were brought back together. Amelia did not recover her memories of the knight, but she was willing to start anew, as long as it was with him. And Gonathon would accept it any day.

#### The Corruption

The final major story, as well as the one that served as a fitting and epic closure to the first journey was the great battle against the Corruption.

After spending tens of thousands of coins on trying to get a hat, Koseki Bijou finally managed to get one, a Stain hat, a hat shaped of a Stain, the very enemy the heroes were fighting against. Overtime, the hat made itself known that it wasn't just an accessory, as it was sentient, and slowly took over its wearer's head, in essense "corrupting" them, turning its weares evil, only wishing to wreak havoc upon the lands.

Bijou was the first to fall, by day 7, she was fully corrupted, and started spreading her influence by giving the hats to others around her. She manged to gather four more corrupted ones, which led to the great battle between the heroes banding together to fight against the corruption and trying to save the ones who'd been corrupted on the final day.

In the end, the heroes were able to subdue the great evil, saving their dear friends from the depths of darkness.

### Chapter 2

#### The In-bread Incident

Possbily the most confusing and crazy storyline, if you could call it that, the In-bread incident, or better kwown as, "The Libestal Incest Situation Is Crazy", was the crazy turn of fiasco that took place on the third day of the second chapter, where the topic of everyone in the kingdom being related, aka inbred, was the talk of the day.

It started off when Shakira asked Gonathon to be her wingman for her to make moves on Immerkind... her cousin. Immerkind, however, was already in love with another, the Princess, so she had no interest. Immerkind then found out the Princess only had her mind on the Outlander, which broke Immerkind's heart.

Gonathon, attempting to comfort Immerkind, claimed that the Princess and the Outlander might be... siblings. This revelation spread, far and wide, to the ears like Peasant the Bae, whom after connecting the dots, came to the conclusion that everyone in the kingdom... was inbred.

I don't know.

#### The Humble Knight and the Witch

Gonathon got himself into yet another love story in the second chapter, this one however, wasn't all sunshine and rainbow like his first one. It was one with twists, depths, one that further shaped his character, even more for the other character in topic, Shiori Nyavella.

Shiori was the initiative on this story, as she sweet-talked her way into scamming Gonathon to buy the food she made. But after seeing how sincere and kind the knight was, her heart wavered, and she was head over heels for the knight. Gonathon's feelings, however, weren't as strong, and overtime it showed. He was dependent, always having to rely on others for crucial decisions, and on multiple ocassions had shown she wasn't as fond of her as she'd hoped. Perhaps because in his heart, someone already took that place.

Shiori made the hard decision of wiping out her memories of him entirely, perhaps to save herself from being hurt, or to save him from being hurt, it's hard to know, it's also hard for the both f them, but they respected each other's choices nonetheless, and went on their seperate ways.
