## Overview

Besides the main storylines within the ENreco universe, there were also countless self-made shenanigans by the heroes themselves, turning it all into a massive headache for anyone trying to keep track. This entry serves as a very brief summary of all the major storylines, both official and player-driven, sorted in roughly chronological order.

_**Note:** These are only short summaries to help grasp the general idea. For more details, read the recaps or check out the related glossary entries._

## Official Stories

These are stories that played out the same for everyone, the main storylines of this enigmatic journey.

### Chapter 1

Nineteen heroes were summoned to the Kingdom of Libestal by its King, stripped of their memories and asked to save the realm from the Stains. With their powers known as Revelations, they ventured forth, conquering dungeons that gradually restored fragments of their memories and strengthened them along the way. In the end, they faced their final challenge, the Stain King, and succeeded in defeating it, completing their mission of saving the kingdom.

However, the King then revealed his true colors. It turned out he had tricked them all along, as defeating the Stain King freed him from his prison. He was the Captive, an entity who sought to destroy the universe itself.

The heroes managed to stop his plan, but with the Captive defeated, the world began to crumble. A mysterious voice then called out, urging them to jump into a portal, marking the end of Chapter 1.

### Chapter 2

That voice belonged to Fia, the keeper of the Library. She pulled the heroes back in time to Ancient Libestal, asking them to stop the being known as the Outsider—revealed to be the same entity once called the Captive—from ever coming into existence, for he would destroy everything.

To figure out how, they first needed to recover Fia's missing memories by conquering Star Sites. Along the way, they met Iphania, the kingdom's princess, and the Outlander, a mysterious swordsman. As Fia's memories returned, the heroes learned the Outlander would one day become the Outsider, in his desperate attempt to save a world ravaged by the Stains.

So Fia asked them to save the world in his place, by destroying the Curse, the source of corruption. They succeeded, or so it seemed, until the Curse returned, killing the Princess and calling forth a mysterious being that punished the Outlander and the heroes for defying fate.

At the last moment, Fia saved them once more. Accepting that the past could not be changed, she asked for their help to protect the present and the future instead. Most agreed, but five—Bijou, Mococo, Fuwawa, Nerissa, and Shiori—refused, choosing to forge their own path.

## Self-made Stories

These stories emerged naturally from the heroes’ interactions. They had no ties to the main narrative but became just as important, shaping ENreco in ways few could have predicted. This only covers the _most notable and persistent_ events.

### Chapter 1

#### FaunaMart and NanaEleven

**Duration:** Day 2 to 7

By day 2, Fauna decided she'd rather live as an NPC than deal with all the hero business. So she opened FaunaMart, a convenience store selling everyday goods and, most famously, FaunaMart lottery tickets, which she claimed would fund a library for the kingdom.

Many suspected a scam, including FaunaMart’s very first customer, Nanamoo. Not one to sit by, Nanamoo started her own rival business by day 7, called NanaEleven, complete with its own lottery... which also scammed people.

Their rivalry came to a head on the final day. What began tense ended in laughter, as they decided to merge their businesses and work together.

#### Lottery Fiasco

**Duration:** Day 4 to 5

Among FaunaMart’s most loyal customers was Mococo—at first. It started with a few tickets, then ballooned into dozens, then hundreds, as she became addicted to gambling. Her obsession grew so intense she threatened and even attacked poor Nerissa, the overwhelmed FaunaMart employee, just because Nerissa wouldn’t hand over money Mococo wrongfully demanded.

Things escalated further when Mococo threatened to sue FaunaMart for “improper business.” But the entire kingdom sided against her. Even so, she still managed to come out ahead, as Nerissa paid her a generous sum just to settle things.

#### A Knight’s Tale

**Duration:** Day 6 to 8

One of the most talked about stories in the first chapter was the love story between Gonathon and Amelia Watson. It left an imprint on ENreco that lasted well beyond its time.

Their relationship began on shaky ground, but through gifts of diamonds and moments of understanding, they grew close and married. Gonathon proved to be a devoted husband, doing all he could to keep Amelia—his “Pearl”—safe and happy. Amelia, of course, remained thoroughly Amelia.

Their tale seemed destined for a happy ending, until on the sixth day, when Amelia regained her past memories and forgot everything about Gonathon. Heartbroken, the humble knight still chose to support her, wishing for nothing but her happiness.

In the end, his unwavering loyalty was rewarded. With help from others and the faint imprint Gonathon had left in her heart, Amelia chose to stay with him, ready to create new memories together.

#### The Corruption

**Duration:** Day 7 to 8

The last major saga of Chapter 1—and a fitting climax—was the battle against the Corruption.

It all began when Koseki Bijou spent tens of thousands of coins trying to get a hat, eventually landing a Stain Hat: a sentient piece of corruption that slowly took control of her. By day 7, Bijou was fully corrupted, spreading her influence by handing out hats to others.

Four more heroes fell, leading to a final showdown. The remaining heroes banded together to save their friends and rid the kingdom of the Corruption once and for all. They succeeded, freeing their dear comrades from darkness.

### Chapter 2

#### The In-bread Incident

**Duration:** Day 3

Perhaps the strangest storyline of all was the “In-bread Incident,” more infamously known as “The Libestal Incest Situation Is Crazy.” It erupted on the third day.

It all started when Shakira asked Gonathon to help her pursue Immerkind—her cousin. Immerkind, however, was already in love with the Princess. Learning that the Princess only had eyes for the Outlander left Immerkind heartbroken.

Trying to console her, Gonathon suggested the Princess and the Outlander might be... siblings. This rumor spread quickly, reaching Peasant the Bae, who then concluded that everyone in the kingdom must be inbred.

#### The Humble Knight and the Witch

**Duration:** Day 1 to 7

Gonathon found himself in yet another love story in Chapter 2, though this one was far more bittersweet. It involved Shiori Nyavella.

It started when Shiori sweet-talked Gonathon into buying her cooking. But the more she saw his sincerity, the more her heart faltered. She fell deeply for the humble knight. Gonathon, however, didn’t return her feelings quite the same way—always reliant on others for decisions, never offering the affection she hoped for. Perhaps it was because someone else already held that space in his heart.

So Shiori made the painful choice to erase all memories of him. Maybe it was to protect herself, maybe to protect him. It hurt them both, but they respected each other’s choices, and went their separate ways.

#### Maven in Blue

**Duration:** Day 1 to 8
One of the more prominent relationship that first bloomed in Chapter 1 was the relationship between Elizabeth and Nerissa. Back then, the relationship was more or less a funny, wholesome one with the two bantering, or bickering? Back and forth, with Nerissa being the teaser and Elizabeth being the straight-woman. However, in Chapter 2, that bond had blossomed and developed into something much more complex.

Nerissa started the second journey with her memories of the previous one gone, meaning she couldn't recall who Elizabeth was either. But overtime, she slowly regained them, which in complement, also regained the bonds she had with Elizabeth from before, but this time it seemed the bond was stronger, and the two could clearly sense they had something for each other.

The bond slowly turned into obsession, and by the final day, Nerissa could not thing about anything else but the red knight, almost to a threatening point, as she wanted Elizabeth for herself, and herself only, she also wanted Elizabeth to think of her, and her only.

As Nerissa, along with four other, turn against Fia and the other heroes, this storyline was left on a cliff-hanger as many are curious on what Elizabeth's reaction to this heel turn would be.

#### Child Dispute

**Duration:** Day 5

Peasant the Bae had countless storylines and moments that cemented her as someone with perhaps the best character growth in the kingdom. One such moment was the child dispute with Koseki Bijou.

At the end of the first chapter, Bijou left Shiori with a child—represented as a small Stain—after breaking up with her. The child, according to Bae, was later found abandoned and alone, prompting the kindhearted peasant to take it under her care.

Bijou, now wanting to mend her bonds with Shiori, tried to persuade Bae to return the child. Bae refused, and the matter was taken to “court,” with Mordon presiding as the jury. Thanks to Bae’s persistence and clear compassion for the child, the dispute ended in her favor, with Bae keeping custody and Bijou granted visitation rights.

#### The Fluffy One’s Cafe

**Duration:** Day 4 to 7

Fuwawa was a humble, hard-working chef who dreamed of opening a café that would serve delicious food to bring smiles to those around her. But that admirable dream was first met with hardship and disappointment; by the halfway point of the journey, she hadn’t sold a single dish.

Thankfully, as if to reward her dedication and devotion, everything changed after the fourth day. Her café was suddenly bustling with customers—her entire stock sold out, orders rolled in for parties, and praise poured in for her cooking. At last, the fluffy one’s dream was realized.

#### The Hot Pink One’s Collapsing Relationship

**Duration:** Day 5 to 8

The Hot Pink One once again found herself entangled in a web of complicated romantic drama. In this second journey, she was in a relationship with both Ina and Tam.

All seemed well at first; each was fine sharing in this polygamous arrangement. But toward the end, the pink one began taking advantage of Tam, treating her more like a “hobby” than a partner.

Everything came to a head on day seven, during a “gender reveal” party for the Hot Pink One’s supposed pregnancy. There, she openly disrespected Tam, flaunting the “child” she shared with Ina. This sparked a heated conflict between the two, causing deep emotional pain for Ina as well.

In the end, both Tam and Ina left the Hot Pink One, each with their own reasons.
