## Overview

Libestans were the inhabitants of the [Libestal Kingdom](#entry:libestal-ficta-entry), acting as interactable characters who made the heroes’ journey all the more lively.

## Details

Libestans took the shape of rabbit-like humanoids, with completely white skin, two long ears hanging by each side, and short, somewhat chubby builds—many found them quite adorable. They appeared in both the fabricated kingdom of Libestal and the real, ancient one. Depending on their role, Libestans could generally be divided into two groups.

### Locals

These Libestans were typically ordinary townsfolk found along roads, tucked away behind castles, or scattered throughout other nondescript areas. Interacting with them often led to snippets of everyday life, sometimes humorous, sometimes revealing small [secrets](https://www.youtube.com/live/CFSfP27KTco?feature=shared&t=5386) about the kingdom or the overarching story. While they didn’t directly contribute to the main quests, heroes were encouraged to speak with as many as possible to better understand the world they were adventuring through.

### Key Figures

Other Libestans held more pivotal roles, such as Quest Masters, Shopkeepers, or major figures like the [Libestal Princess](#entry:iphania-entry) and the [Libestal King](#entry:outsider-entry). These individuals provided side quests that rewarded money or artifacts, sold essential items for the journey, or in the case of the more prominent Libestans, handed out quests tied directly to the main storyline.
