## Overview

Ancient Libestal, unlike the [fabricated kingdom](#entry:libestal-ficta-entry) the heroes were summoned to in the first chapter, was a real version of Libestal—set in a time before [the Outsider](#entry:outsider-entry) came into being. It was here that the heroes began their second journey, with the objective to stop the Ruination, destroy the source of the corruption, and ultimately save the world as well as the universe.

## Details

### Preface

As the Captive was defeated and the fabricated world designed to contain him slowly crumbled away, a mysterious voice saved the heroes from the dying realm. That voice belonged to [Fia](#entry:iphania-entry), the current caretaker of the Library, who brought the heroes back in time to an earlier, real Libestal. She hoped that the heroes, now known as the Shining Stars, could prevent the Outsider, an entity of pure hatred destined to destroy the universe, from ever coming into existence.

### Setting

Ancient Libestal, as its name implies, was set in a distant past, reflected in its antique architecture and atmosphere. The kingdom served as the last sanctuary for the world’s inhabitants, as the rest of the land was slowly being consumed by the Ruination. Stains ravaged the wilderness, and death was ever-present. Unlike the previous Libestal, there were no guilds here. Instead, the kingdom’s survival relied on four core [occupations](#entry:jobs-entry):

- **The Smith** – Forged upgrade stones used to enhance Revelation weapons.
- **The Jeweler** – Crafted charms that enhanced health and bolstered defense.
- **The Chef** – Cooked meals that granted powerful buffs for exploration and combat.
- **The Supplier** – Enchanted tools to improve resource-gathering efficiency.

One noticeable difference between the fabricated and the real Libestal was how alive everything felt. Citizens were plentiful, and wherever the heroes went, they encountered new faces to interact with.

### Appearance

From above, the kingdom had a compact layout, with buildings made mostly of mud brick, adding to its ancient charm. While familiar structures such as a castle and residential areas remained, they differed significantly from their counterparts in the fabricated Libestal.

**The Castle**
The largest structure in the kingdom, the castle, focused on height rather than width. It housed the Princess, numerous workers, and many refugees, instantly making it feel far more alive than the vacant halls of the previous castle.

Within the castle grounds were a variety of facilities, including the Princess's chambers, a dining hall, a dueling area, a casino, merchant stalls, and more. Most kingdom activities and sidequests took place here.

**The Abandoned Temple**
Located at the center of the residential area and directly in front of the castle gates, is an abandoned temple. To the heroes it was the entrance to the [Library,](#entry:library-entry) a central hub of the second chapter’s story and the place where Fia resided.

**Build Area**
Surrounding the Library were expansive plots of land allocated to the heroes for free building. Compared to the limited, guild-restricted building areas in the first chapter, this iteration offered far more freedom and fewer restrictions, allowing for grander, more personalized structures.

At some point not long ago, the entire castle town had burned down—explaining why the building area was empty and why all the Libestans now resided within the castle walls. Several residents reminisce about their old homes before the fire, and there are subtle hints sprinkled throughout about who might have started it, though the culprit’s identity remains unknown. It was during this fire that the Outlander first proved his heroism to the Libestans, rescuing townsfolk in the chaos. A few castle residents even mention being saved by him.

### Quests

Both side and main quests returned, with expanded depth and limitations to prevent previous exploits (such as earning tens of thousands of coins from mass-producing potato salad). Sidequests still served as a source of income and power-ups, while main quests progressed the storyline and restored lost memories—this time not just of the heroes, but also of Fia.

Certain sidequests now had level requirements, encouraging progression and role specialization before access.

### Remnants

As the story advanced, new regions called Remnants became accessible, offering new materials, enemies, story content, and challenges that demanded real teamwork. These areas were:

- **Remnants of the Cliffs of Sidero** – Unlocked early after choosing occupations and finishing initial quests.
- **Remnants of the Lykeion Campus** – Unlocked after conquering Star Site: Elpis.
- **Remnants of the Antigonian Aerie** – Unlocked after conquering Star Site: Chronos.

### Star Sites

As in the previous chapter, the heroes needed to clear dungeons to recover their memories and progress the story. These were known as Star Sites:

- [Star Site: Elpis](#entry:star-site-elpis-entry) – Unlocked on Day 2; contained IRyS's memories.
- [Star Site: Chronos](#entry:star-site-chronos-entry) – Unlocked on Day 4; contained Ouro Kronii's memories.
- [Star Site: Chaos](#entry:star-site-chaos-entry) – Unlocked on Day 5; contained Hakos Baelz's memories.

### Other Quests

In addition to Star Sites, two major dungeons served as key plot events:

- [Stronghold of Ruin](#entry:stronghold-of-ruin-entry) – Unlocked on Day 3; where the heroes first encountered and freed the Outlander.
- [Heart of Ruin](#entry:heart-of-ruin-entry) – Unlocked on Day 7; the final dungeon where the source of all evil, the Curse, was destroyed.

Before entering the Heart of Ruin, the heroes undertook a special quest on Day 6 titled **The Ritual**, which served as a narrative bridge into the finale.

### Ending

After defeating the Heart of Ruin and saving the world, the heroes joined the kingdom's citizens for a grand victory banquet. Just as the celebration peaked, tragedy struck: the Princess was assassinated by the Curse, which had somehow survived. A mysterious higher being appeared, ready to punish the heroes for “defying fate.”

In the final moment, Fia intervened, transporting the heroes back to the Library to escape annihilation.

With sorrow, Fia acknowledged that preventing the Outsider’s birth was impossible. The only path forward now was to prevent whatever his intentions were in the present—and that meant Libestal was doomed. Ancient Libestal fell, marking its inevitable demise.
