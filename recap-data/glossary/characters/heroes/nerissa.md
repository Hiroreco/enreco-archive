## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected

Nerissa Ravencroft, also known as Nerissa Pickles Mustard Linkin' Park Juliet Bloodflame Ravencroft (what a long name!) in Chapter 2, was a dedicated member of the Scarlet Wand- the guild of the knowledgeable or as the people in Libestal Ficta call it, the guild of witches. She has some sort of love-hate relationship with Lady Bloodflame which has not been resolved in Chapter One, and thus has been carried over in Chapter Two despite her memory loss.
