## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected
**Revelation:** [Gremlin Grenade](#entry:gremlin-grenade-entry)

The humble knight known as Gonathon G. has faced many trials and tribulations during his adventures in Libestal, but has never once abandoned his dedication to helping those in need. Gonathon was committed to fighting for his beloved Queen and the people of the kingdom, as well as the many friends he made during his adventures. While hardly a stranger to heartache and loss, Gonathon's unbreakable resolve to do what was right and his steadfast humility would see him through many challenges, even those from the most unlikely of places.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Gonathon G.
**Guild:** Cerulean Cup

While legends would tell that Gonathon G. was a humble knight of stalwart heart and noble deed, the truth of the matter is that his tale was marked by missteps and indecision.

For much of the first chapter of his adventure, Gonathon was labeled as an easy mark by those who sought to exploit him. His hard work and dedication saw him amass a hearty fortune in gold, and many others, including those he saw as friends, would [manipulate and exploit him for money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB2jUKUsxtE&t=6008s). Yet, despite these often obvious ploys, Gonathon remained committed to helping others and wished to bring out the best in them.

Along with his desire to assist others, Gonathon’s strongest quality was his deep devotion to those he deemed important. First, there was [Tam Gandr](#entry:kronii-entry), the upstart and self-proclaimed queen of Libestal. Despite leaving only a few days after the journey began, Gonathon remained loyal to her to the very end, even going so far as to build a massive statue in her honor. Even as others demeaned her, attempted to usurp her position, and even defaced the statue Gonathon built, the humble knight [remained dedicated to the one he saw as a queen worth serving](https://youtu.be/oygFzGlMT28?t=2979).

In addition to Tam, Gonathon’s relationship with [Jyonathan Watson](#entry:ame-entry) would define his days in Libestal. Starting as a target of Gonathon’s suspicions, Gonathon and Jyonathan would soon fall in love and become married—a stalwart diamond and a gentle pearl. Alas, [tragedy](https://youtu.be/oygFzGlMT28?t=9378) would strike the Pearl in the form of amnesia brought about by the recovery of her past memories. Worse still, a crestfallen Gonathon appeared to simply accept the loss of his Pearl. It was here that Gonathon’s kindness to others would bear fruit, as his friends intervened and exhorted him not to give up on his Pearl. With friends at his back and love in his heart, Gonathon was able to [break through to Jyonathan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvRIdaH107U&t=12776s), and the two shared a tearful reunion as the first chapter of their adventure came to a close.

Despite many fumbles along the way, Gonathon would prove not only that he was a loyal and devoted friend, but also that deep down, he was capable of fighting for his own beliefs, and not simply blindly following the desires of others.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Gonathon G.
**Job:** Smith

The second chapter of Gonathon’s adventure would see even more triumph and heartache. Going into this new adventure, the humble knight was seemingly once again afflicted with amnesia, and the loss of the memory of his Pearl would serve as the core of his struggles.

Despite his mental malaise, Gonathon would go on to help many people and inspire his friends to stay true to themselves. Although he viewed himself as a simple servant of the queen, he would form and lead the [Wolf Pack](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=2105), composed of his closest friends and allies. Along the way, he would motivate Cecilia Immerkind to embrace her love for Princess Iphania, drive Tam Gandr to accept her role as queen, [strike down the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9279), and bring a heartbroken Peasant The Bae back from the brink of despair. The position of blacksmith was a natural choice for Gonathon, as it allowed him to provide upgrades to his companions' gear, allowing him to protect them in spirit.

At the same time as his humility and everlasting loyalty shone through, so too did his naivety and inability to make his own choices. Nowhere was this more apparent than in his relationship with [Shiori of the Nyavellas](#entry:shiori-entry). Unable to recall his Pearl, Gonathon sought to mend the hole in his heart by supporting and courting Shiori. Regardless of his pure and noble intentions, Gonathon’s [failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSPi8sTHdAY&t=12003s) to decouple his dedication to his queen from his desire for love led him to [fumble](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=16262) several times in his interactions with Shiori. While the two eventually reconciled, this heartbreak would leave a lasting impact on Gonathon, and finally push him to [take more agency](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=10507) in his life.

While the future remains murky, particularly given the climactic conclusion of Chapter 2, Gonathon has come out of his adventures in ancient Libestal determined to fight for what he believes in and right his past wrongs.

## Trivia

- In Chapter 1, Gonathon was able to have some level of interaction with every other member, an impressive feat considering this included Bae the Peasant, who was absent for all but the first and final day.
- In both Chapters 1 and 2, Gonathon's attempts to build massive structures ran into snags due to being unable to build above a certain elevation. This was the case for his Tam Gandr statue in Chapter 1 and the World Tree house in Chapter 2. Interestingly, both cases were also references to members of Promise, Ouro Kronii and Ceres Fauna, respectively.
- Gonathon's gender being male was due to Gigi Murin's misunderstanding that she was playing an amnesiac version of herself rather than a unique character. Even after learning this, she decided to stick with having Gonathon be referred to as he/him.
- If one had a nickel for every time Gonathon’s love interest forgot about him, they’d have two nickels—which isn’t a lot, but it’s oddly enough that it happened twice.
