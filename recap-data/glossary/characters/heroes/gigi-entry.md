## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected
**Revelation** [Gremlin Grenade](#entry:gremlin-grenade-entry)

The humble knight known as Gonathon G. has faced many trials and tribulations during his adventures in Libestal, but has never once abandoned his dedication to helping those in need. Gonathon was committed to fighting for his beloved Queen and the people of the kingdom, as well as the many friends he made during his adventures. While hardly a stranger to heartache and loss, Gonathon's unbreakable resolve to do what was right and his steadfast humbleness would see him through many challenges, even ones from the most unlikely of places. 

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Gonathon G.

**Guild:** Cerulean Cup

Gave money to lots of people. Jyonathon Pearl saga. Conflicts with Liz. Dedication to Tam Gandr. Tam statue. Bijou corruption. 

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Gonathon G.

**Job:** Blacksmith

 The second chapter of Gonathon’s adventure would see even more triumph and heartache. Going into this new adventure, the humble knight was seemingly once again afflicted with amnesia, and the loss of the memory of his Pearl would serve as the core of his struggles. 

Despite his mental malaise, Gonathon would go on to help many people and inspire his friends to stay true to themselves. Although he viewed himself a simple servant of the queen, he would form and lead the Wolf Pack, composed of his closest friends and allies. Along the way he would motivate Cecilia Immerkind to embrace her love for Princess Iphania, drive Tam Gandr to accept her role as queen, strike down the Hot Pink One, and bring a heartbroken Bae the Peasant back from the brink of despair. The position of Blacksmith would serve as a natural choice for Gonathon as it allowed him to provide upgrades to his companions' gear, allowing him to protect them in spirit.

At the same time as his humbleness and everlasting loyalty shown through, so too did his naivety and inability to make his own choices. Nowhere was this more apparent than in his relationship with Shiori of the Nyavellas. Unable to recall his Pearl, Gonathon sought to mend the hole in his heart by supporting and courting Shiori. Regardless of his pure and noble intentions, Gonathon’s failure to decouple his dedication to his queen from his desire for love led him to fumble several times in his interactions with Shiori. While the two eventually reconciled, this heartbreak would leave a lasting impact on Gonathon, and finally push him to take more agency in his life. 

While the future remains murky, particularly given the climatic conclusion of Chapter 2, Gonathon has come out of his adventures in past Libestal determined to fight for what he believes in and right his past wrongs.
