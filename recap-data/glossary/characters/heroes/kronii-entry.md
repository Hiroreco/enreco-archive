## Overview

**Memories:** Recollected

Tam Gandr, now fully remembered as Ouro Kronii, was infamous in the kingdom for her oppressive charisma, razor-sharp tongue, inflated narcissism, and most of all—her endlessly boasted, self-proclaimed status as Queen.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Tam Gandr
**Guild:** Cerulean Cup

The name Tam was given by Gonathon—an acronym for _The Azure Maiden_. "Gandr," the surname, was proudly self-appointed. From the moment she met the King of Libestal, Tam twisted his request for aid into a royal proposal and immediately crowned herself Queen.

From Day One, she was already amassing devoted followers. Gonathon stood as her most loyal knight, ready to defend her at every turn—whether she was being accused of illegitimacy or stirring up conflict herself by flaunting her so-called royalty. Usually, it was the latter.

But for every follower, Tam earned herself a rival. Elizabeth was the first to call out Tam’s “fake” queen status, while Raora positioned herself as a competing royalty. And to be fair, their suspicions were justified. Tam had no claim, no proof, and worst of all—no money. She was _broke_, constantly pretending to be rich, boasting about her 8 billion coin fortune while barely scraping together 8 actual coins.

Yet beneath the ironclad ego and tyrannical tone, Tam was, at heart, a caring queen. Knowing her journey would only last three days—far shorter than others—she spent her time supporting her guildmates: building a base, sharing what little she had, and standing up for them when needed.

And yes, there was even space in her allegedly cold heart for a potential romance. She fell for the Hot Pink One, but that crush ended in disappointment, as the pink maiden was already promised to another.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Tam Gandr / Ouro Kronii
**Job:** Supplier

Tam began her second journey with no memory of the first one. Gone was the commanding queen; in her place stood someone quieter, more withdrawn, content with grinding in solitude and basking in the peace.

That peace didn’t last.

After reclaiming her memories at Star Site: Chronos—where the Warden, Ouro Kronii, reawakened within her—Tam was pulled back into chaos. Her fumbling knight Gonathon brought drama to her door via a complicated telenovela-like story with Shiori. Cecilia publicly framed her as a tyrannical queen. Things got so bad even her therapist asked if she’d considered murder as a reasonable solution.

Yet the most tumultuous arc was her relationship with the Hot Pink One. Fate had seemingly given them a second chance. Early on, the two bonded, exchanged cheesy nicknames like “Tammy” and “Pinky,” and formed a surprisingly sweet connection.

But it didn’t last.

As time passed, the pink lady began to dominate the dynamic, treating the once-queen as her maid, her toy, her personal _hobby_. The breaking point came during a gender reveal party for Pinky’s non-existent child. With a straight face, she asked Tam to be godfather to her and Ina’s kid.

That was it. Tam snapped.

She severed ties, took revenge, and made a play for Ina herself. In a dramatic reversal, the oppressed queen reclaimed her crown—not through royalty, but by clapping back hard and laughing as she came out on top.
