## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected
**Revelation:** [Fuchsia Claws](#entry:fuchsia-claws-entry)

Mococo Abyssguard was definitely not the typical hero you'd imagine when you hear the word. She was notable for being a lottery addict in Chapter 1, helpless to the adrenaline that gambling gives her. One of the most chaotic and shameless of the bunch, it's a miracle how this mischievious dog learned from her poor financial decisions to become a hardworking jeweler and therapist in Chapter 2.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Mococo Abyssguard
**Guild:** Jade Sword

Mococo started out in quite a vulnerable state. Before Elizabeth vowed to be her protector and big sister, she felt frightened of this new world. She was easily persuaded to overspend in the Faunamart's lottery in spite the concerns of others. She soon turned into a problem, though, by extorting her friends for more money, thus damaging her relationships.

Nonetheless, there were hints that this troublemaker was much more than that. Her money-grubbing attitude has led her to realize that she _needed to work_ for her money. Do business and such. Her sister and friends were also equally if not the most important to her. Mococo was scared to be alone truth be told. It was for the best she quit gambling (before returning through NanaEleven).

Her journey was not smooth-sailing . This, also due the corruption that took over Mococo's mind and killed Fuwawa's chickens too

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Mococo Abyssguard
**Job:** Jeweler

Chapter 2 presented Mococo an opportunity to start anew and forget her mistakes. This jeweler was sort of a meddler herself— eavesdropping is her new hobby.

On the final day, Mococo, along with Fuwawa, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori, rejected Fia’s wish and chose to rebel.
