## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected

Mococo Abyssguard was definitely not the typical hero you'd imagine when you hear the word. She was notable for being a money-grubbing lottery addict in Chapter 1, helpless to the adrenaline that gambling gives her. One of the most chaotic and shameless of the bunch, it's a miracle how this mischievious dog got to learn how to work for her money in Chapter 2.

But then came the twist.

On the final day, Fuwawa, along with Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori, turned away from the other heroes. They rejected Fiaâ€™s wish and chose to follow their own path.
