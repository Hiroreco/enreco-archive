## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected
**Revelation:** [Fuchsia Claws](#entry:fuchsia-claws-entry)

Mococo Abyssguard was hardly the image of a typical hero. Notorious for her lottery addiction in Chapter 1, she was helpless against the thrill of gambling. She was one of the most chaotic and shameless of the bunch, willing to do just about anything to line her own pockets.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Mococo Abyssguard
**Guild:** Jade Sword

Mococo’s journey began in a vulnerable place. Before Elizabeth promised to be her protector and big sister, she was terrified of this strange new world—easily frightened and desperate not to be left [alone.](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=4128) But with her friends’ support, she slowly found her footing, working hard and living up to her role as a hero—though that didn’t last long.

By the second day, she had discovered [FaunaMart’s lottery tickets](#entry:faunamart-entry). It started with just a couple, but soon grew to hundreds, as the doggo blew through her funds despite everyone’s concerns. What began as harmless fun soon spiraled into an addiction. Mococo became a problem herself, extorting friends for more money and [straining relationships.](https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?t=1251)

Yet there were glimpses of something more to her. Her obsession with money led her to understand she actually needed to _work_ for it—do business, hustle, and earn her keep. Her sister and friends were still the most important things in her life. Underneath it all, Mococo was terrified of being alone. Eventually, she managed to quit gambling—at least until NanaEleven tempted her back.

By the journey’s end, she fell to the corruption—first swayed by Bijou’s influence, and by far the most afflicted of all. She hurt others, ravaged the lands, slaughtered animals and destroyed crops, which led everyone to pull away from her—the very thing she dreaded most. Even Elizabeth, whom she adored most, looked on with [wary eyes.](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?si=N5N4vgyOALaXs9db&t=1610)

But with everyone’s help, Mococo was saved. She carried immense gratitude in her heart. For all her chaos, she was still just a kind, innocent puppy at her core.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Mococo Abyssguard
**Job:** Jeweler

The second journey offered Mococo a fresh start. Determined to do better, she vowed to work hard, stay away from gambling—well, mostly—and repay those who had once helped her.

And she did. As a dedicated jeweler and loyal employee of Gacharms, she kept herself busy and, with no lottery around, was spared from falling into old habits again. Sure, the gambling didn’t vanish completely, but it was far less destructive this time.

Her chaotic nature persisted, though. Eavesdropping became a new hobby—on one occasion, she overheard Mordan’s therapy session and decided to open her own [therapy business.](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=-ZizHO6g5xCSHEr9&t=9493) Never mind the lack of credentials; her sessions consisted of “uh huh, yeah, just follow your heart,” delivered like a true pro. But hey, for dirt-cheap prices, you got what you paid for.

Toward the journey’s end, Mococo started feeling... off. A creeping sickness, a gnawing sense of something wrong. On the final day, her suspicions proved true. As if seized by a mysterious force, she, along with four others, defied Fia and the rest of the heroes, choosing to carve their own path instead.

## Trivia

- Mococo seems to have it out for chickens: she slaughtered Fuwawa’s entire flock in Chapter 1 and later killed the Hot Pink One's “child”—which happened to take the form of a chicken—on sight in Chapter 2.
- Her relentless pursuit of wealth made her the third richest hero by the end of Chapter 1 (just behind Fauna and Nerissa) and one of the top earners again in Chapter 2, with coin totals hitting the five-digit mark both times.
- She bought a whopping **452 lottery tickets** in Chapter 1 (447 from FaunaMart, 5 from NanaEleven). From this, she won only 710 coins at FaunaMart, and 500 coins at NanaEleven (whose tickets were free), but walked away with a 10,000-coin settlement from Nerissa during the lottery fiasco. In the end, she netted a profit of 6,740 coins.
- When Cecilia requested a 5% cut from the 10,000-coin settlement for her legal services, Mococo handed her 180 coins—a mere 1.8%. Cecilia didn’t question it.
