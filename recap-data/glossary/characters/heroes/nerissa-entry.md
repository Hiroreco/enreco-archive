## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected

Nerissa Ravencroft, also known as Nerissa Pickles Mustard Linkin' Park Juliet Bloodflame Ravencroft (what a long name!) in Chapter 2, was a dedicated member of the Scarlet Wand- the guild of the knowledgeable or as the people in Libestal Ficta call it, the guild of witches. She has some sort of love-hate relationship with Lady Bloodflame which has not been resolved in Chapter One, and thus has been carried over in Chapter Two despite her memory loss.

Nerissa began her Chapter 2 journey, again, with a blank slate. No memory of her own past or of other; even her own name, she could not recall. Thus, she had the wisest idea to ask around and rely on her fellow heroes to name her.
