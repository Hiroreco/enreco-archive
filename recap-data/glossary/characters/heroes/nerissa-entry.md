## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected
**Revelation:** [Resonant Strike](#entry:resonant-strike-entry)

Nerissa Ravencroft, also known as Nerissa Pickles Mustard Linkin' Park Juliet Bloodflame Ravencroft (what a long name!) in Chapter 2, was a dedicated member of the Scarlet Wand- the guild of the knowledgeable or as the people in Libestal Ficta call it, the guild of witches. She has some sort of love-hate relationship with Lady Bloodflame which has not been resolved in Chapter One, and thus has been carried over in Chapter Two despite her memory loss.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Nerissa Ravencroft
**Guild:** Scarlet Wand

Woke up in a white room full of other human blocks. This was not your ordinary isekai story. Nerissa Ravencroft found herself caught up in a "new" world full of eccentricities and bizarre adventures. 

Stains? King? Save the world?! It was all just too confusing and overwhelming. She couldn't even remember her past nor her name, and here she was delegated to save this strange land? Come to think of it, she couldn't even recall if she "accepted" the call that led her to be transported in the Kingdom of Libestal.

Regardless, here she was, thriving... and making tons of monies (she was still poor) through the quests she took on a daily basis. 


### Chapter 2

**Name:** Nerissa Ravencroft/ Mustard/ Pickles/ Linkin' Park/ Juliet Bloodflame/ Nerissa
**Job:** Chef

Nerissa began her Chapter 2 journey, again, with a blank slate. No memory of her own past or of others; in fact, she could not even recall even her own name. Thus, the quest for recollecting her memories began. She started off by asking her fellow heroes, if ever they were acquainted in the past. Such inquiry has been proved quite futile since most of those she asked could also not remember her or their own past selves.

Throughout Chapter 2, she has been a diligent and hard-working citizen. A multi-tasker, she was able to juggle in between her job as a chef and as a hero of Libestal, slaying cows... I mean, stains that casually attacked the city. Not to mention her addiction, err... rather, hobby of gambling and stalking Lady Bloodflame.

Eventually, she slowly remembered her past as well as the others'. She also recalled she was good friends (?) with Lady Bloodflame, however, could not understand why the Lady Knight accused her of being a witch even in the previous life despite their intimate (?) relationship. Did she do something wrong to her? That she couldn't remember yet? At any rate, this accusation has led her to believe that perhaps she was indeed a witch and so decided to actually become one. Towards the end, she turned and yielded to the dark side forming an allegiance with her fellow witches, Shiori of the Nyavella, Stain Princess Bijou, and the Fuzzy ann Fluffy doggos Fuwawa and Mococo.
