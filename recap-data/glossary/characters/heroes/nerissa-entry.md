## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected
**Revelation:** [Resonant Strike](#entry:resonant-strike-entry)

Nerissa Ravencroft, also known as Nerissa Pickles Mustard Linkin' Park Juliet Bloodflame Ravencroft (what a long name!) in Chapter 2, was a dedicated member of the Scarlet Wand- the guild of the knowledgeable or as the people in Libestal Ficta call it, the guild of witches. She has some sort of love-hate relationship with Lady Bloodflame which has not been resolved in Chapter One, and thus has been carried over in Chapter Two despite her memory loss.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Nerissa Ravencroft
**Guild:** Scarlet Wand

This was not your ordinary isekai story. Nerissa Ravencroft  woke up in a white room full of other human "blocks" who, for some reason, were vaguely familiar to her. Together with these "heroes", she would find herself caught up in a "new" world full of eccentricities and bizarre adventures. 

Stains? King? Save the world?! It was all just too confusing and overwhelming. She couldn't even remember her past nor her name, and here she was delegated to save this strange land? However, it seemed she had no choice, and thus accepted the task the King of Libestal had bestowed upon her.


Grouped with other heroes, Gaoo Gura, Cecilia, Shiori, and Fauna, she became part of the Scarlet Wand guild who prides themselves with curiosity and knowledge which later became known as the Guild of the Witches.

Her interactions with the other heroes were quite "normal" except for a certain knight who claimed to be "monitoring" her. This fumbling warrior accused her of being a witch, and their conversations were nothing but flirting (just kiss already). [Spoiler: they actually did].

She also became assistant to her not-so suspicious guildmate, Ceres Fauna, who owned a convenience store and hosted a dubious raffle contest. Days have passed, she then encountered the Fuzzy One who bought quite a few tickets and then eventually accused her of scam due to a simple misunderstanding. This accusation led to the Fuzzy One putting a bounty on her head. She sought protection from the scarlet knight, Lady Bloodflame who then promised to do so. Even then, she got killed by the Phoenix, and thus became a ghost, roaming around... seeking justice for her untimely death.

While in her ghost form, she discovered some rather interesting secrets of the kingdom, which has put the motivation of the king to destroy the Stains into question. Was it actually to save the Kingdom? Or he had some other vain plans in mind? Nerissa confronted her friends regarding this, a few believed but Lady Bloodflame, refused and claimed to remain loyal to the king no matter what. 


### Chapter 2

**Name:** Nerissa Ravencroft/ Mustard/ Pickles/ Linkin' Park/ Juliet Bloodflame/ Nerissa
**Job:** Chef

Nerissa began her Chapter 2 journey, again, with a blank slate. No memory of her own past or of others; in fact, she could not even recall even her own name. Thus, the quest for recollecting her memories began. She started off by asking her fellow heroes, if ever they were acquainted in the past. Such inquiry has been proved quite futile since most of those she asked could also not remember her or their own past selves.

Throughout Chapter 2, she has been a diligent and hard-working citizen. A multi-tasker, she was able to juggle in between her job as a chef and as a hero of Libestal, slaying cows... I mean, stains that casually attacked the city. Not to mention her addiction, err... rather, hobby of gambling and stalking Lady Bloodflame.

Eventually, she slowly remembered her past as well as the others'. She also recalled she was good friends (?) with Lady Bloodflame, however, could not understand why the Lady Knight accused her of being a witch even in the previous life despite their intimate (?) relationship. Did she do something wrong to her? That she couldn't remember yet? At any rate, this accusation has led her to believe that perhaps she was indeed a witch and so decided to actually become one. Towards the end, she turned and yielded to the dark side forming an allegiance with her fellow witches, Shiori of the Nyavella, Stain Princess Bijou, and the Fuzzy ann Fluffy doggos Fuwawa and Mococo.
