## Overview

**Memories:** Recollected
**Status:** Off on a journey

Jyon Watson, now remembered as Amelia Watson, was a mischievous and lovable detective whose relationship with [Gonathon](#entry:gigi-entry) remains one of the most memorable and impactful tales of the journey. Though her whereabouts after the first chapter are uncertain—having not appeared in the second journey—many hold onto hope for her return in future stories.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Jyon Watson, Amelia Watson
**Guild:** Jade Sword

Jyon wasted no time causing a stir with her chaotic antics. On her very first day in the kingdom, right after the King had summoned the heroes in hopes of salvation, Jyon hatched a plan to assassinate him. Naturally. Her reasoning? She mistook “Revelation” for “Revolution” and believed the King to be evil, especially since he appeared to bear a "stain"—on [his pants](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?t=7108), of all places.

Word of this great conspiracy quickly spread, reaching the ears of Gonathon, the ever-loyal knight who was determined to stop and expose Jyon at all costs. But instead of conflict, fate had other plans: by the second day, the two were happily married, after an exchange of diamonds.

Jyon was adored by all. With her cheerful energy and iconic “Bonk” from her [Revelation](#entry:eye-of-wisdom-entry), she brought laughter and light wherever she went. It was no wonder the orange knight fell head over heels for her.

But just as their love story bloomed, tragedy struck. After conquering the [Ancient Sewer Dungeon](#entry:ancient-sewer-dungeon-entry), Jyon regained her past life’s memories as Amelia Watson—at the cost of forgetting her current self and, more painfully, forgetting Gonathon. The orange knight was heartbroken. Yet Amelia's pain ran deeper, haunted by a sense of having lost something precious—something she couldn’t quite remember.

Through the guidance of the voices in her head, nudges from those around her, and the lingering feelings buried deep in her heart, she didn’t regain her lost memories—but she found the courage to start anew. Moved by the knight’s steadfast love, Amelia chose to rebuild their bond from scratch. Together, they wove themselves a new [happy ending.](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=12776)

This marked the close of her chapter—for now. She set off to take care of something important, but the door remains open, if only slightly, for her return to the world and to the knight who still waits.

## Trivia

- One of the Ancient Sewer Dungeon's rewards was the Teleportation Crystal. This crystal was stated to have been made by Ame.
