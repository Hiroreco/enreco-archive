## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected
**Revelation:** [Bookmark of Memories](#entry:bookmark-of-memories-entry)

Shiori was possibly one of the most intriguing heroes. Weird, quirky, unpredictable—her surface was all eccentricities, but underneath lay secrets, depth, and a quiet, unnerving awareness. Hints were dropped all along that she retained not just her own memories, but fragments of everyone else's as well. There was an aura to her—of someone who knew things others didn’t, things she _shouldn’t_.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Shiori Nyavella
**Guild:** Scarlet Wand

In the first chapter, Shiori appeared to be little more than the oddball who kept to herself. She hovered on the fringes, avoided drama, asked bizarre questions, and said strange things that raised eyebrows and caused, at times, [psychic damage.](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=8760)

She floated like a leaf in the wind, constantly swept into relationships she never agreed to. Betrothed to Bijou? Sure, until Bijou dumped her on the final day and left her with a baby to raise alone. Dragged into a polygamous relationship with four other women? Yes—only to see it crash and burn at the end.

> It was a pleasure doing business with you, wife of mine.
> Now get out of my sight.

Shiori just wanted a simple life. But fate had other plans.

Amidst the chaos, however, she found herself intrigued by Gonathon G—a sincere, loyal knight devoted to his Pearl. Something about his earnestness stirred something in her. She tried to win him over, but when she saw his heart already belonged to someone else, she let it go, quietly and respectfully.

All of that might sound like harmless, comedic fluff, but those distractions obscured a deeper thread. Throughout the journey, Shiori dropped [cryptic remarks](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?si=Tv8iBK5Q96G63XiA&t=6689) suggesting she had never truly lost her memories at all—that she was merely playing along.

It all came to a head in one final statement:

> Thank you for being a part of my amnesiac story!
> But the question is: Did I really have amnesia?

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Shiori Nyavella
**Job:** Chef

Chapter 2 began much like the first: Shiori was still odd, still drifting, still spouting peculiar lines. But this time, she chose to be more present, more deliberate in her interactions. She made stronger bonds, opened up, got involved. For some, it was refreshing. For others, like poor Mordan Ramsey, it was a nightmare, as Shiori [terrorized](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=Y_mj_z_Qpgx2OJKj&t=11795) the tavern owner endlessly in every way possible.

But this new openness led to one of the chapter’s most significant romances: her relationship with [Gonathon](#entry:gigi-entry). Fate had seemingly offered Shiori another shot at the orange knight—now with no memories of his past beloved, who was no longer around.

But just as she was ready to take the next step, Gonathon faltered. He hesitated, depended too much on others, and never made his own choices. His devotion felt more like obligation than love. Shiori gave him chances—many of them—but, when it became clear he wouldn't change, she made the painful decision to [step away.](#entry:humble-knight-witch-entry) They returned to being friends… or so it seemed.

In truth, Shiori took things further: she _wiped_ him from her memory entirely.

Because yes—Shiori could manipulate memories. Whether she could do it to others was unclear, but she could certainly do it to herself.

Beyond being a butter-churning, beet-eating chef, Shiori held another secret identity: _an Archiver_. She took on writing commissions, often silly "fanfics," but hidden among them were the “Memory” commissions. These were not fiction. These were truths—recollections of real [memories,](https://www.youtube.com/live/tJ_YXGE3o2w?si=7ajFqe3fWIHtWYs2&t=11107) forgotten or buried.

Some found these tales amusing, while others found them disturbing. Some doubted their veracity. But Shiori insisted: _she never lied. Everything she wrote was the truth._

> She did commision me for her memory, and the truth, and I delivered it.
> I would not give it to her unless she, herself, wanted it.

She knew.
Everything.
Even things no one else remembered.
Even things she was never _supposed_ to know.

About the _scripts_ that guided their lives.
About the events playing out in the kingdom, behind the curtains and beyond the veil.
About the _story_.

And perhaps it was this knowledge that drove her final decision.

When Fia called on the heroes to fight the Outsider, five of them refused: Nerissa, Bijou, Fuwawa, Mococo, and Shiori. Standing at the front of this rebellion, it was Shiori who spoke first—declaring their rejection of Fia's plea and sparking a new chapter of resistance.

Ever calculating, ever perceptive of her surroundings, everything Shiori did throughout this journey—whether silly or serious—was always done with _intention_. And now, it’s time for one of the most complex characters in this entire tale to step into the spotlight.

## Trivia

- Shiori has a habit of referring to others not by their actual names, but by quirky, often oddly specific titles. For example, she calls Nerissa "the birded one" or _"the tall lady,"_ Gonathon "the fumbly one," and Mococo "the belly button girl," among others.
