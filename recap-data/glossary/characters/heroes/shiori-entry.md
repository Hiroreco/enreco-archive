## Overview

Shiori was possibly one of the most intriguing heroes. Weird, quirky, unpredictable—her surface was all eccentricities, but underneath lay secrets, depth, and a quiet, unnerving awareness. Hints were dropped all along that she retained not just her own memories, but fragments of everyone else's as well. There was an aura to her—of someone who knew things others didn’t. Knew things she _shouldn’t_.

This omniscient undertone came to full light in Chapter 2, culminating in a shocking heel turn at the end of the journey alongside four others.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Shiori Nyavella
**Guild:** Scarlet Wand

In the first chapter, Shiori appeared to be little more than the oddball who kept to herself. She hovered on the fringes, avoided drama, asked bizarre questions, and said strange things that raised eyebrows and caused—at times—psychic damage.

She floated like a leaf in the wind, constantly swept into relationships she never agreed to. Betrothed to Bijou? Sure, until Bijou dumped her on the final day and left her with a baby to raise alone. Dragged into a polygamous relationship with four other women? Yes—only to see it crash and burn at the end.

Shiori just wanted a simple life. But fate had other plans.

Amidst the chaos, however, she found herself intrigued by Gonathon G—a sincere, loyal knight devoted to his Pearl. Something about his earnestness stirred something in her. She tried to win him over, but when she saw his heart already belonged to someone else, she let it go, quietly and respectfully.

All of that might sound like harmless, comedic fluff, but those distractions obscured a deeper thread. Throughout the journey, Shiori dropped cryptic remarks suggesting she’d never truly lost her memories at all. That she was merely _playing along_.

It all came to a head in one final statement:
_“But the question is: Did I really have amnesia?”_

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Shiori Nyavella
**Job:** Chef

Chapter 2 began much like the first: Shiori was still odd, still drifting, still spouting peculiar lines. But this time, she chose to be more present—more deliberate in her interactions. She made stronger bonds, opened up, got involved. For some, it was refreshing. For others—like poor Mordon Ramsay—it was a nightmare, as Shiori terrorized her tavern endlessly in every way possible.

But this new openness led to one of the chapter’s most significant romances: her relationship with Gonathon. Fate had seemingly offered Shiori another shot at the orange knight—now with no memories of his past beloved, who was no longer around.

What started as manipulation—tricking him out of coins—slowly bloomed into affection. Gonathon’s kindness chipped away at Shiori’s walls. She cooked for him, made a shared room, and genuinely cared. It was sweet, quiet, and in stark contrast to her whirlwind past.

But just as she was ready to take the next step, Gonathon faltered. He hesitated. Depended too much on others. Never made his own choices. His devotion felt more like obligation than love. Shiori gave him chances—many of them—but when it became clear he wouldn't change, she made the painful decision to step away. They returned to being friends… or so it seemed.

In truth, Shiori took things further. She _wiped_ him from her memory entirely.

Because yes—Shiori could manipulate memories. Whether she could do it to others was unclear, but she certainly did it to herself.

Beyond being a butter-churning, beet-eating chef, Shiori held another secret identity: _an Archiver_. She took on writing commissions—often silly "fanfics"—but hidden among them were the “Memory” commissions. These were not fiction. These were _truths_—recollections of real memories, forgotten or buried.

Some found these tales amusing. Others found them disturbing. Some doubted their veracity. But Shiori insisted: _She never lied. Everything she wrote was the truth._

She knew.
Everything.
Even things no one else remembered.
Even things she was never _supposed_ to know.

About the _scripts_ that guided their lives.
About the events playing out in the kingdom, behind the curtains and beyond the veil.
About the _story_.

And perhaps it was this knowledge that drove her final decision.

When Fia called on the heroes to fight the Outsider, five of them refused: Nerissa, Bijou, Fuwawa, Mococo and Shiori. Standing at the front of this rebellion, it was Shiori who spoke first—declaring their rejection of Fia's plea, and sparking a new chapter of resistance.
