## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected
**Status:** Running from the authorities

Nanamoo was strange, weird, arguably unwell, or—if we’re being generous—simply silly. Her offbeat demeanor and unsettlingly unpredictable energy managed to spook not only a few of the other heroes, but even the voices in her head. No one could quite tell what she was doing or why she was doing it, but one thing was clear: she was adorable. And much like her green business partner, she’s now on the run from the authorities for a very familiar reason—scamming.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Names:** Cleopatra Eisenhower Da Vinci The Great III, Darwin Roosevelt DiCaprio Jr., Napoleon Galileo Aristotle Targaryen, Nanamoo
**Guild:** Amber Coin

Nanamoo—or whatever she was called in her ever-growing list of names—began her journey like most others, with a peculiar obsession for horses, often making horse noises and sharing equine-related commentary. Though she was technically part of the Amber Coin [guild](#entry:guilds-entry), she spent most of her time with the Scarlet Wand bunch, earning herself an honorary title among the [red ranks.](https://www.youtube.com/live/zPJ78C7uNq8?feature=shared&t=360)

She also claimed to have never lost her [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?t=3518) to begin with, insisting she vividly remembered a past life full of Ferraris, loyal friends, running water, and undeniable coolness. Whether any of that was true remained deeply questionable. Her erratic ramblings—like randomly proclaiming a male knight to be pregnant—only fueled the belief that she might be a few marbles short.

Nanamoo’s rise to fame—or infamy—really began with the launch of her own store: _NanaEleven_. As FaunaMart’s first ~~victim~~ customer, she quickly caught on to the green CEO’s morally questionable practices and decided to challenge them—not by doing better, but by doing worse. Her version of “honest” business? Out-scamming the scammer.

Despite the rivalry, the business war ended with the two swindlers shaking hands, forming an unlikely partnership in the name of profit. Together, Fauna and Nanamoo fled the kingdom with pockets full and reputations... [complicated.](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=1970)

Her journey was brief, chaotic, and incredibly silly—but one that left a lasting impression on all who crossed paths with the ever-horsing, ever-hustling Nanamoo.

## Trivia

- Despite her masterfully crafted lottery scam, Nanamoo ended up with less profit than what she spent to set the whole scheme in motion, as she only managed to extort two out of the many people she had sold the tickets to.
