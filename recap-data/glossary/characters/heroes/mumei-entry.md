## Overview

**Memories:** Not Recollected
**Revelation:** [Winds of Civilization](#entry:winds-of-civilization-entry)
**Status:** Running from the authorities

Nanamoo was strange, weird, and arguably unwell—or, if we’re being generous, simply silly. Her offbeat demeanor and unsettlingly unpredictable energy managed to spook not only some of the other heroes, but even the voices in her head. No one could quite tell what she was doing or why, but one thing was clear: she was adorable. Now, much like her green business partner, she’s on the run from the authorities for a very familiar reason—scamming.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Names:** Cleopatra Eisenhower Da Vinci The Great III, Darwin Roosevelt DiCaprio Jr., Napoleon Galileo Aristotle Targaryen, Nanamoo
**Guild:** Amber Coin

Nanamoo—known by an ever-growing list of names—began her journey like most others: with a peculiar obsession for horses. She often made horse noises and shared equine-related commentary. Though technically a member of the Amber Coin [guild](#entry:guilds-entry), she spent most of her time with the Scarlet Wand group, earning herself an honorary title among the [red ranks.](https://www.youtube.com/live/zPJ78C7uNq8?feature=shared&t=360)

She also claimed never to have lost her [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?t=3518), insisting she vividly remembered a past life full of Ferraris, loyal friends, running water, and undeniable coolness. Whether any of that was true was highly questionable. Her erratic ramblings—such as declaring a male knight to be pregnant—only reinforced the belief that she might be a few marbles short.

Nanamoo’s rise to fame—or infamy—began with the launch of her own store: _NanaEleven_. As FaunaMart’s first ~~victim~~ customer, she quickly caught on to the [green CEO’s](#entry:fauna-entry) morally questionable practices and decided to challenge them—not by doing better, but by doing worse. Her idea of “honest” business? Out-scamming the scammer.

Despite their rivalry, the business war ended with the two swindlers shaking hands, forming an unlikely partnership in the name of profit. Together, Fauna and Nanamoo fled the kingdom with full pockets and reputations... [complicated.](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=1970)

Her journey was brief, chaotic, and incredibly silly—leaving a lasting impression on all who crossed paths with the ever-horsing, ever-hustling Nanamoo.

## Trivia

- Despite her masterfully crafted lottery scam, Nanamoo ended up with less profit than she spent to set the whole scheme in motion, having managed to extort two out of the many people she had sold the tickets to.
