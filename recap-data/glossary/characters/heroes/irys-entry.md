## Overview

**Memories:** [Recollected](https://youtu.be/5uaWaQg4pnM)
**Revelation:** [Light and Darkness](#entry:light-and-darkness-entry)

The Hot Pink One, now remembered as IRyS, was a whirlwind of relationship chaos wrapped in a deceptively carefree shell. Wherever she went, confusion and drama followed—especially of the romantic variety. A magnet for affairs, this pink enigma drew women in just as easily as she pushed them away, thanks to her ever-perplexing personality.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Hot Pink One
**Guild:** Cerulean Cup

In the first chapter, the Hot Pink One maintained an aloof, detached demeanor, mostly meandering through her days with an air of nonchalance. Memory loss or not, she remained herself, often ridiculed for the absurdities that escaped her mouth.

She soon wove herself into the kingdom's shenanigans. Despite her relative inactivity compared to others, she quickly carved out a notorious reputation as a "side chick magnet."

As early as Day 2, she had already claimed a wife—NinoIna—and, despite professing [eternal loyalty](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?t=9715) to the purple one, continued to gather more women into her orbit—four more, to be exact. She even attempted to ensnare a fifth: a memory-lost [blonde](https://www.youtube.com/live/pH9lSCrTVMY?feature=shared&t=1792) searching for her beloved. A reminder that the pink one was a member of [Cerulean Cup](#entry:guilds-entry), the supposedly empathetic guild.

Call it karma or collapse, but eventually, her polycule of side chicks unraveled, with only her eternal consort remaining at her side.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Hot Pink One, IRyS
**Job:** Chef

If Chapter 1 was wild, Chapter 2 showcased the full extent of the Hot Pink One’s chaotic energy. Even though she'd lost her memories again, her personality remained intact—just as eccentric as ever—with her web of relationships becoming even more tangled.

Still known as the Hot Pink One, she took on the role of a chef specializing in chocolate cakes. She also recovered memories of her past self after conquering the [Star Site: Elpis](#entry:star-site-elpis-entry)—recalling herself as IRyS, the embodiment of hope, albeit a drunken one.

And as each day passed, the pink one's entanglement with others grew more and more complicated.

New threads formed: romantic, platonic, and confusing, sometimes all three. She shared mouth-to-mouth meals with a pink cat, declared best friendship with Immerkind (or so the green one claimed), and became part of a peculiar cult known as the "Inbread."

Her familial side blossomed—with Koseki Bijou as her [brother](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=s8GiS__Q7mOaFuB_&t=436), endlessly devoted to her throughout the journey. Ina, her eternal consort, also remained steadfast as her romantic partner. And Tam Gandr, a new and passionate love interest, stood by her side, someone to constantly banter back and forth with.

Everything was going great, until the last few days.

Near the end, to escalate her already chaotic life, the pink one claimed to be pregnant. Bijou even hosted a gender reveal party, unveiling the baby’s gender as [“Gas”](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5739)—since many suspected she was simply gassed up, not pregnant. The events that transpired afterwards shattered her bond with Tam, who then concluded the Hot Pink One wasn’t worth it. That led to an affair between Tam and Ina, which in turn led to Ina embarking on a journey of enlightenment, leaving the pink one devastated and spiraling into a yandere-like state.

For anyone following the story from her perspective, it was easy to lose track of the actual objective everyone came here for.

## Trivia

- Unsurprisingly, as of Chapter 2, the Hot Pink One holds the record for the most romantic (or ex-romantic) partners: Bijou, Nerissa, Shiori, Amelia (for about a minute), Ina, and Tam.
