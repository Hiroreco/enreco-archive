## Overview

**Memories:** [Recollected](https://youtu.be/A3bQdV_sl08)
**Revelation:** [Burning Phoenix](#entry:burning-phoenix-entry)

Shakira, short for Tanakisha Karia and now known as Kiara, is the almighty phoenix warrior always eager to support her friends and fight for justice. Despite her occasional mishaps, she consistently followed her mind and heart, no matter the cost.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Tanakisha Karia of the Oranges, Shakira, The Savior of the Lesbians
**Guild:** Amber Coin

Tanakisha Karia’s destiny was clear from the moment she awoke: to save the ~~lesbians~~ Libestans. Embracing such a heroic calling, the orange lady always tried her best to stand on the side of justice. She reported potential [scams](https://www.youtube.com/live/qKlzaYirN88?feature=shared&t=1129) to Queen Tam Gandr, shielded her friends from deceit, and openly challenged misdeeds. When Nerissa kept pestering Elizabeth to gain her affection, Shakira didn’t hesitate to [call her out.](https://www.youtube.com/live/3cr3DLpyB60?si=lQ_VjUGHZ9A1G2r7&t=13330)

Life could feel lonely in her guild. The Amber Coin had far fewer members than most, especially after one wandered off to the woods and another switched guilds. Still, she pressed on undeterred.

She rarely entertained nonsense from anyone, always confident and unwavering in her judgment. Yet by journey’s end, this phoenix found herself yearning for someone to love and come home to. She showed interest in a certain [humble knight,](https://www.youtube.com/live/3cr3DLpyB60?feature=shared&t=21557) but his heart was already taken. In the end, she learned to keep moving forward on her own.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Shakira, Kiara Takahashi
**Job:** Smith

Kiara held her head high in Chapter 2. Assigned a new role as a “Lore Keeper” alongside Mordon Ramsey, she eagerly embraced this new life and its responsibilities.

With her special role, she felt even more compelled to help others however she could. She became something of Elizabeth’s “sugar mommy,” providing materials, lending a hand, guiding the ever-confused knight who struggled to settle in—she even built her a forge. The kind-hearted orange also helped make a fluffy chef’s [dream come true:](https://www.youtube.com/live/wCysZh57Hcc?si=amYBd0PYc_tTX567&t=18155) seeing Fuwawa’s dishes left unsold day after day, she stepped in and bought nearly all of them.

Shakira’s curiosity and playful spirit thrived too, as she happily threw herself into others’ antics, acting as the kingdom’s camerawoman and bearing witness to countless [dramas.](https://www.youtube.com/live/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14970)

Sometimes, though, her eagerness to help caused trouble of its own. With only the best intentions, she arranged a blind date for Mordon Ramsey and Gonathon—unwittingly setting off a chain reaction that sent Gonathon and Shiori’s relationship into a [tailspin.](https://www.youtube.com/live/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8832) She also ended up playing a part in sparking the kingdom’s infamous “In-bread Incident.”

Her relationships this chapter were far more entangled than in the first, where she largely kept to herself. She even developed a crush on Immerkind… who happened to be her cousin. Perhaps a sign of just how starved for romance she was after her lonely first journey.

Naturally, that didn’t pan out. But when Shakira hit her lowest point, feeling alone in a kingdom overflowing with romance, she found hope in an unexpected place: a certain beeg cat. In a sudden, heartwarming turn, Kiara married Roa, her newfound admiration [blossoming](https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=eGpYwslFn09813CQ&t=13080) into love. Her second chapter closed on a truly wholesome note. She’d finally earned the happy ending to her love story—what more could anyone want?

## Trivia

- The name **Shakira** was actually suggested by Gonathon, since Tanakisha Kiara was a bit too much of a mouthful to read.
- Shakira often boasted about her ability to speak “the language of the gods,” otherwise known as **German**, proudly one of only two in the entire kingdom who could.
