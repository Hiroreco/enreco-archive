## Overview

**Memories:** [Recollected](https://youtu.be/SDnRHwpnIH4)
**Revelation:** [Oceanic Terror](#entry:oceanic-terror-entry)
**Status:** Back to Atlantis

Gura was joyful, quirky, and someone everyone loved to be around thanks to her bubbly personality and sense of humor. Though her journey with the others was cut short when she was taken back to Atlantis, the memories she made—with her friends and the voices in her head—will remain forevermore.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Gawr Gura
**Guild:** Scarlet Wand

Gura was among the most excited to embark on this strange adventure. She lit up whenever she discovered new things—new mechanics, fascinating dungeon designs, clearly enamored by the thought and creativity behind it all. She regularly expressed admiration for the creators of these intricate feats.

She was also savage and sassy, delighting in poking fun at others, especially Tam and [Jyon Watson,](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=Zjtfn-It4RAxI-V-&t=7423) _especially_ Jyon. Gura seemed to sense that the two had some sort of preexisting bond—not the romantic kind, but the sort where you’d buy a box of lemons just to leave it in front of the other’s door for no reason. She also loved to mess with Gonathon, fully aware that the knight was head over heels for Jyon.

Gura was the founder, or at least, the first member, of the “Appointed Point” cult? Association? Something along those lines. She was the first to don the long, red scarlet hat that became the signature of her [guild](#entry:guilds-entry) and wore it with pride, often boasting about its power and the responsibility that came with it. Thanks to her initiative, the Scarlet Wand members became one of the most united groups.

Though she remained awake and active for a large part of the kingdom's journey, she somehow managed to dodge most of the chaos caused by the other heroes. That didn’t stop her from causing some of her own though, like building a [gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?t=4184) behind a convenience store. For reasons.

She regained her past memories after conquering the [Underwater Dungeon](#entry:underwater-dungeon-entry), recalling herself as a princess, well, perhaps a commoner, depending on who you asked, from Atlantis. In her past life, she had stolen the all-powerful trident and fled to the surface, bored of the life beneath the sea. But fate caught up with her. Eventually, the dwellers of Atlantis came and took her back—though not before she bid one final farewell to her fellow heroes.

## Trivia

- When the heroes were teleported back to the white box at the end of Chapter 1, Gura sneakily managed to return to Libestal. This was, of course, not supposed to happen, and she was quickly brought back into the box by the gods.
