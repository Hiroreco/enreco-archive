## Overview

Elizabeth had always been a knight through and through. From the very first day of her journey, she stood unwavering—just, strong-willed, and devoted to what was right. She fought against wrongs and injustice with unwavering conviction. Yet beneath that armored resolve lay a caring, loving heart that always looked out for others. This was especially true when it came to a certain blue maiden, whose very presence sent the red knight’s heart fluttering time and time again.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame
**Guild:** Jade Sword

Elizabeth began her journey with a conviction that would define her character throughout, even with no memory of who she once was. She embraced the mantle of a knight—dutiful, responsible, compassionate, and loyal to her King.

But as noble as she was, Elizabeth was also terribly clumsy and somewhat clueless when it came to the inner workings of the kingdom. The systems were far too advanced for a classical knight like her, and more often than not, she ended up needing help instead of giving it.

Still, her spirit mattered most. Her genuine care and kindness made her a dependable companion to many. She was the ever-trusty guardian of the two doggos, a reliable comrade to her guildmate Calli, and the first to stand up to Tam for her arrogance. She even adopted Bijou—temporarily—just because the gem maiden asked her to.

She did it all because she believed it was her duty as a knight. It was what she should do. It was what her King would want.

But not everything she did stemmed from duty.

Nerissa Ravencroft. Just the sound of that name was enough to make Elizabeth’s heart race and her face flush with the color of strawberries. Witchcraft—that’s what Elizabeth called it. She deemed Nerissa a witch for making her feel this way, and because of that, she decided it was her _duty_ to “monitor” her. But was that truly her King’s will? Or was it her own?

Elizabeth played a major role in liberating the kingdom from corruption on the final day. But just when it seemed the fight was over, the truth shattered her world. The King she had loyally served was revealed to be evil—a deceiver who had manipulated them all. Elizabeth was devastated, her beliefs and ideals turned on their head. At first, she hesitated, insisting that the King was still her ruler. But upon witnessing her comrades get hurt, she made a choice: to no longer fight for a king, but for her friends—and for herself.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame
**Job:** Smith

Elizabeth’s new journey saw her unchanged in spirit—still kind, still helpful, still firmly righteous. And yes, still struggling with the kingdom’s systems. Like last time, with support from friends like Shakira, she began to manage.

One noticeable thing about her this time, though—she was more relaxed compared to before. She'd sneak around, peeking in on others' shenanigans by making herself invisible (well, sort of), eavesdropping on their conversations. She’d tag along and banter with those she felt close to, like Cecilia and Roa, and even joined in on bizarre, chaotic events—like the kingdom’s gender reveal party.

She started journaling all of it in a series she called _Knight Logs_, chronicling her experiences, recalling her last journey, and—of course—detailing her continued “monitoring” of her “Juliet,” Nerissa Ravencroft.

This journey marked clear progress in that “monitoring” relationship. The endless bickering and witch accusations from the first chapter gave way to bonding moments—sparring, gambling, hanging portraits beside one another, writing heartfelt letters. It was a deepening connection. Though the witch accusations? Those stayed.

Then came the twist. At the end of the journey, Nerissa—along with four others—turned against the heroes to follow her own path. Elizabeth’s reaction was left unspoken, left for the next chapter. Was it anger? Shock? A sense of betrayal? Whatever it was, Elizabeth would want a happy ending. For herself. For everyone.

Because through this journey, the scarlet knight came to understand more of what it meant to _truly_ be a knight.

A knight needs no glory, no praise—only purpose. The more she fulfilled that purpose, the more she began to wonder about her life before all this. A life where—

> "My heart was whole. Where I was not afraid of my own name. Where I did not flinch at the sound of my own sword."

She couldn’t remember that life—not fully. But she could feel traces of it. Perhaps in lingering memories, or in words from those who knew the truth, even if she wasn’t ready to accept it. But no matter what her past held, one thing remained certain—one truth that would never change:

> "And yet still, I rise.
> I lend my sword to those who need it—even if it means I break a little more with every swing.
> Kindness need not feel soft to be real.
> Sometimes, it is simply what remains when everything else has burned away."
