## Details

Rich peasant

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Peasant Da Bae

**Guild:** Amber Coin

Just like her newly found companions, Peasant Da Bae found herself whisked away to the land of Libestal with nary a memory. Scared and confused, it took Bae much of Day 1 to get used to her duties as a hero, but, ultimately, this was a profession she would reject. Bae was not a hero, they chose the wrong rat for she is but a humble, simple peasant! Deep into the woods Da Peasant ran, missing much of the fights, adventures, and complicated relationships (See any relationship chart from Chapter 1) during this time. And sparring herself the grief of understanding the romance of EnReco Chapter 1.

However, one can only escape their fate for so long; Bae would be found, and dragged, back to the Libestal to her [grievance](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=1529). Sometimes when the world asks for you, even when you don't answer the call, the call would call truck-kun to have you dragged back... *What? The King was the enemy?* Bae knew that the Monarchy was the true enemy all along! [Down with the King](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=4833).

On the bright side, Bae got a [nice peasant hat (with a gold coin)](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=1844) for her troubles.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Peasant The Bae

**Job:** Supplier

Unlike Chapter 1, Peasant *The* Bae found a bit more courage in Chapter 2. And more ambition. Starting of as a peasant, Bae toiled and worked for gold - even opening her very own business named "tHE dUMPSTER". She would reach customers to sell her services and soon, "Peasant" would be more of an honourable name rather than a label of her richness.

But it was not just wealth that Bae experienced, Bae's would see the rise and fall of love, the rewards of motherhood, and The Pinnacle of Brotherhood. Her evergrowing love for Immerkind sent her in a blush of romance but, alas, it would also send her into a spiral of despair. But from that despair came hope (that isn't IRyS), as a Brotherhood would be born between her and Gonathan. 

Memories would return to Bae. Peasant she was not, but CHAOS HERSELF! But the memories returned conflicted with the memories already had. Bae wondered about the mysterious figure in her memories but the answers escape her. Nevertheless, Bae would still remain Peasant The Bae in honour of the Charlie, a brat she helped but took her beloved wish granting box as a prank.
