## Overview

**Memories:** [Recollected](https://youtu.be/aSFZwinYaaU)
**Revelation:** [Chaos Stampede](#entry:chaos-stampede-entry)

Bae may be a peasant of little wealth (at first), but what remains inside is the true heart of a hero. A hard worker with a touch of chaotic gossip, when Bae sets a goal in mind—whether it be love or gold—she _will_ put her all into it. Though her romance isn't as chaotic as _others_ _cough IRyS cough_, Bae spreads chaos of the non-romantic variety whenever the opportunity presents itself.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Peasant The Bae
**Guild:** Amber Coin

Just like her newly found companions, Peasant The Bae found herself whisked away to the land of Libestal with nary a memory. Scared and confused, it took Bae much of Day 1 to get used to her duties as a hero, but, ultimately, this was a profession she would reject. Bae was not a hero; they chose the wrong rat, for she is but a humble, simple peasant! Deep into the woods the peasant ran, missing much of the fights, adventures, and complicated relationships during this time, and sparing herself the grief of understanding the romance in the kingdom.

However, one can only escape their fate for so long; Bae would be found and dragged back to Libestal to her [grievance](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=1529). Sometimes when the world asks for you, even when you don't answer the call, the call will call Truck-kun to have you dragged back... _What? The King was the enemy?_ Bae knew that the monarchy was the true enemy all along! [Down with the King](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=4833).

On the bright side, Bae received a [nice peasant hat (with a gold coin)](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=1844) for her troubles.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Peasant The Bae
**Job:** Supplier

In Chapter 2, Peasant The Bae certainly had more color to her story. From rags to riches, Bae toiled and worked for her gold, culminating in her own successful business, ["tHE dUMPSTER"](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=14135). Bae seizes any opportunity to sell her wares or offer her services to any customer who comes her way. Soon, "Peasant" became much more than a status of her previous lack of wealth; ["Peasant"](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=1511) is an honorable title Bae wore.

From little gossips that casually slandered the royal body that governs the kingdom, putting the 'libel' in *Libel*stal, to heartfelt connections, Bae truly connected with others more in this chapter. Though her [growing love with Immerkind](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4571) unfortunately ended in heartbreak, it nonetheless gave way to a [brotherhood stronger than obsidian](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5292). Bae would find a steadfast friend in Gonathan G as he remained by her side during the most trying time of her life.

It wasn't just friendships Bae found; Bae found kids. Abandoned, she took them under her wing and cared for them, even to the point of a [custody dispute](#entry:custody-dispute-entry) with Bijou and Shiori. Luckily, and at the expense of Mordan Ramsay, [State Farm was formed](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13328) between this small dysfunctional family plus Gonathan.

But who was "Peasant The Bae" truly? In the midst of the games of the Chaos Dungeon, fragments of memories would soon return... Bae worried at first: would she still be "Bae" if she remembered? As the Stain King fades in defeat, Bae remembers... She wasn't a peasant—Bae was CHAOS HERSELF. Even with her identity recovered, Bae swore to remain a [peasant](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=5680) in honor of the brat who took her beloved box. That Charlie...

Though some memories were recovered, it was only some. A few questions lingered in Bae's mind, especially about a certain mysterious Mother whose advice Bae still remembers post-amnesia.

#### Mother

Throughout Chapter 2, Bae has constantly made references to a mysterious figure in her memories whom she simply called "Mother." "Mother" has offered many words of wisdom to Bae before she mysteriously disappeared from Bae's life. Unfortunately, even with the return of some of Bae's memories, the origin of "Mother," who she truly was, remains a mystery. Perhaps "Mother" was actually "Brother" in the form of Charlie? Whoever she, or he, is, it remains to be seen if Chapter 3 will unveil this mysterious character.

Notable wise words from Mother found in Chapter 2:

["Mother always said, if you have nothing... you have nothing."](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2111)

["Day 2 Diary 2 entry: Mother always warned me..."](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=11052)

["Mother always warned me, with love comes heartbreak"](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=733)

[Not a quote but Mother skipped a certain lesson for Bae](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=7171)

## Trivia

- Despite only being around for two days and showing little interest in the kingdom, Bae somehow ended up with more coins than Tam in Chapter 1, narrowly avoiding the title of the kingdom’s poorest.
- When Bae wore the Stain Hat in Chapter 2, it caused quite a stir. Many feared she was falling to corruption like so many did in Chapter 1—especially since she kept complaining about headaches while wearing it. Thankfully, she turned out fine.
- Bae takes great pride in her title as _“Peasant”_ and was quick to put anyone in their place if they dared think it was something shameful.
