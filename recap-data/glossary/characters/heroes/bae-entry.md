## Overview

**Memories:** [Recollected](https://youtu.be/aSFZwinYaaU)
**Revelation:** [Chaos Stampede](#entry:chaos-stampede-entry)

Bae may be a peasant of little wealth (at first), but what remains inside is a true heart of a hero. A hardworker with a little chaotic gossip touch, when Bae sets a goal in mind, whether it be love or gold, she *will* put her all in it. Though her romance isn't as chaotic as *others* *cough cough IRyS*, Bae spreads Chaos of the non-romantic variety when the opportunity presents itself. See Chapter 2 Day 3.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Peasant Da Bae

**Guild:** Amber Coin

Just like her newly found companions, Peasant Da Bae found herself whisked away to the land of Libestal with nary a memory. Scared and confused, it took Bae much of Day 1 to get used to her duties as a hero, but, ultimately, this was a profession she would reject. Bae was not a hero, they chose the wrong rat for she is but a humble, simple peasant! Deep into the woods Da Peasant ran, missing much of the fights, adventures, and complicated relationships (See any relationship chart from Chapter 1) during this time. And sparring herself the grief of understanding the romance of EnReco Chapter 1.

However, one can only escape their fate for so long; Bae would be found, and dragged, back to the Libestal to her [grievance](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=1529). Sometimes when the world asks for you, even when you don't answer the call, the call would call truck-kun to have you dragged back... *What? The King was the enemy?* Bae knew that the Monarchy was the true enemy all along! [Down with the King](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=4833).

On the bright side, Bae got a [nice peasant hat (with a gold coin)](https://youtu.be/t5NGryTaGqk?t=1844) for her troubles.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Peasant The Bae

**Job:** Supplier

Chapter 2's Peasant the Bae certainly had more colour to her story. From rags to riches, Bae toiled and worked for her gold, culminating in her own successful business, ["tHE dUMPSTER"](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=14135). Bae seizes any opportunity to sell her wares or offer her services to any customer her way. Soon, "Peasant" became much more than a status of her previously lack of wealth, ["Peasant"](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=1511) is an honourable title Bae wore.

From little gossips that casually slanders the royal body that governs the kingdom, putting the 'libel' in *Libel*stal, to heartfelt connections, Bae truly connected with others more in this Chapter. Though her [growing love with Immerkind](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4571) that unfortunately ended in heartbreak, it nonetheless gave way to a [Brotherhood stronger than obsidian](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5292). Bae would find a steadfast friend in Gonathan G as he remained by her side during the most trying time of her life. 

It wasn't just friendships Bae found; Bae found kids. Abandoned, she took them under her wing and cared for them, even to the point of a custody dispute with Bijou and Shiori. Luckily, and at the expense of Mordan Ramsay, [State Farm was formed](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13328) between this small disfucntional family plus Gonathan.

But who was "Peasant The Bae" truly? In the midst of the games of the Chaos Dungeon, fragments of memories would soon return... Bae worried at first, would she still be "Bae" if she remembers? As the Stain King fades in defeat Bae remembers... She wasn't a peasant, Bae was CHAOS HERSELF. Even with her identity recovered, Bae swore to remain [Peasant The Bae](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=5680) in honour of the brat who took her beloved Box. That Charlie...

Though some memories were recovered, it was only some. A few questions lingered in Bae's mind, especially about a certain mysterious Mother whose advice Bae still remembers post-amnesia.

### Mother

Throughout Chapter 2, Bae has constantly made references to a mysterious figure in her memories whom she simply called "Mother". "Mother" has offered many words of wisdom to Bae before she mysteriously disappeared from Bae's life. Unfortunately, even with the return of some of Bae's memories, the origin of "Mother", who she truly was, remains a mystery. Perhaps "Mother" was "Brother" in the form of Charlie? Whoever she, or he, is, it remains to be seen if Chapter 3 will unveil this mysterious character.

Notable wise words from Mother found in Chapter 2:

[Mother always said, if you have nothing... you have nothing.](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2111)
