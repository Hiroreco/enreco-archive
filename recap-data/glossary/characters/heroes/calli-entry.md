## Overview

**Memories:** [Recollected](https://youtu.be/j8I3gqJV1NU)
**Revelation:** [Rest In Peace](#entry:rest-in-peace-entry)

Mori Calliope, now with the memories of a disciple of Death itself, didn’t go around slicing people’s lifelines or doing anything grim like that. In fact, she was a woman of many talents—a tavern owner, therapist, auctioneer, builder, you name it. Dedicated to her craft, she was always willing to serve the community, as long as it brought happiness to others.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Mori Calliope
**Guild:** Jade Sword

Calli was one of the few whose reason for being transported to this enigmatic universe was known—and, in typical fashion, she got hit by [a truck.](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?t=331) Timid and somewhat more reserved than others, she tried to avoid chaos whenever she could, mostly keeping to herself. She eventually recalled her past self as Mori Calliope—a reaper, a disciple of Death—after conquering the Underworld Dungeon.

Calli was a woman of justice, standing firmly for what was right and a trustworthy ally to those on the same path, like Elizabeth. Still, she made quite a name for herself by running a tavern called **Death Do Us Part**, which didn’t just serve food—it offered divorce services, too. Seeing how the kingdom was bursting with love, she recognized an opportunity, fully expecting those couples to fall apart in the end. Naturally, those married were appalled… until they actually lined up for her [services](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=11280) on the last day.

Calli also played a critical role in the battle against the corruption on the final day. As all hope seemed lost, she was the one who managed to concoct the [cure](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?t=8835) that ultimately saved everyone—really putting her culinary skills to the test. Her tavern bustled with activity, which made its pink-haired owner very happy. Perhaps it was her true calling to bring people together, whether through food, comfort, or even paperwork.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Mordan Ramsey
**Job:** Chef

The reaper’s second journey began with a duty already resting on her shoulders. Along with Shakira, she was chosen as one of the “Lore Keepers,” tasked with recording the heroes’ daily adventures for the Library.

Unlike many others, she retained all her memories from the previous journey. So, she thought, why not build another food establishment? Being a chef again felt only natural. Adopting the name _Mordan Ramsey_, she opened a new restaurant that doubled as an inn—offering both meals and lodging—and even included a secret fight club, where she and her [“Wolf Pack”](https://www.youtube.com/live/uX0rZYSrb4Q?si=ygzF1V3H5aVxDjwl&t=6658) occasionally held sparring sessions.

That wasn’t all. Calli also put her other skills to work by opening a therapy stall, offering a listening ear and wise counsel to troubled hearts for a modest fee of 300 coins. This service quickly proved indispensable; as the kingdom’s chaos escalated, more and more people [flocked](https://www.youtube.com/live/ABO6qUKDBG0?si=zw4PRzXBRiyCgpjw&t=14246) to her for help—so many, in fact, that the therapist herself began to wish she could get therapy.

Naturally, Mordan found herself tangled in a few shenanigans, too. She almost ended up in a romance with Gonathon through a blind date setup, if not for Shiori swooping in to reclaim the knight. Even so, Calli poured her heart into interacting with others and making things for them. Her care shone through especially when she spent countless days and nights building houses to [auction off](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=5528) to those still without a roof over their heads.

She was, after all, a woman of many talents—one deeply invested in the happiness and well-being of her friends.

## Trivia

- In Chapter 1, Calli’s tavern actually cost her more than it earned, since she was constantly handing out free meals and discounts—most of her “customers” were too broke to pay.
- Every single divorce Calli officiated on the last day of Chapter 1 was to untangle Bijou’s messy web of relationships.
- In Chapter 2, Calli became notably wary—and downright fearful—of Shiori, who kept meddling with her businesses and saying unsettling things. Just the goth’s presence alone was enough to send chills down her spine.
