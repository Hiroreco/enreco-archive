## Overview

The contrast between the gem maiden’s petite figure and voice and the chaos she brought upon this journey was quite remarkable—but that’s exactly what Koseki Bijou was. Mischievous, adorable, and unwaveringly committed to whatever she set her sights on—no matter how silly, or how much pain it might cause others. A truly special gem to have.

## Details

### Chapter 1

**Name:** Koseki Bijou
**Guild:** Cerulean Cup

Bijou was unpredictable—_very_ unpredictable. Which was saying something, considering the existing chaos caused by the other heroes. But Bijou’s unpredictability was on a completely different level.

Just a few days in, she’d already managed to get herself a wife—Shiori—whom she loved dearly… only to dump her on the final day, leaving her with a child.

She also acquired a mother. Two, actually. And got involved in a polygamous relationship with three other women, all while wearing a wide colon-D smile on her face. A smile she often used to get what she wanted—after all, who could say no to that cute, pleading expression?

She claimed to be of royalty—a princess, to be precise—because of the crown she wore. Whether she was truly royal was up for debate, considering she acted like a literal toddler: always up to mischief, constantly messing about.

But when it came to commitment, Bijou didn’t mess around. Early on, she set her sights on a goal—not saving the world or anything trivial like that—but acquiring a hat. She dedicated entire days and nights, hoarding money, gambling her life away just to afford more gacha boxes. All because she saw someone else’s hat and got jealous.

That hat, as it turned out, would shift the entire narrative—not just for her, but for the whole kingdom. It was a _Stain hat_, and over time, it slowly corrupted its wearer’s mind until they were consumed completely. Bijou was its first victim. She dubbed herself the _Stain Princess_, spreading chaos across the kingdom, corrupting the land with fire, writing cursed tomes titled _Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame x Nerissa Ravencroft_, and dragging others into corruption alongside her.

Ultimately, with the combined efforts of the remaining heroes—most notably her sister, NinoIna—the corruption was purged, and Bijou was saved. She realized how painful it was to be shackled by something beyond her control. In response, she severed her ties to the polygamy situation, and to Shiori as well.

### Chapter 2

**Name:** Koseki Bijou
**Job:** Jeweler

In this second chapter, the mischievous gem maiden had lost all memories of her previous journey. So naturally, she did what made perfect sense: declared a random stranger—the Hot Pink One—as her brother.

She was obsessed with this “onii-chan,” wagging after her whenever she was near, snuggling up to her like an actual little brother asking about her school day (don’t question the gender dynamic here). She cared so much about her that she was even willing to leap off a cliff beside her during her darkest moment. She even organized an entire gender reveal party in her honor. Once again, Bijou's dedication and commitment were front and center.

In contrast, her so-called brother had done virtually nothing good for her. If anything, she caused her more familial trauma than comfort, to the point where the poor gem had to rely on _maps_ as her coping mechanism.

Bijou also served as a diligent employee at the Gacharm business, a loyal wingwoman and sidekick for her boss, Roa, and a loving sister to Ina—once again, the two reunited from their past journey. Tam also became her mother, simply because Bijou wanted her to be. Déjà vu?

She even attempted to atone for her past mistake—abandoning Shiori and their child. This time, she managed to mend their fractured bond.

In short, Bijou was kind and diligent toward everyone around her. It felt as though she was doing her best to redeem herself—for falling to corruption, for hurting those she cared about. She had turned over a new leaf, no longer driven by blind greed.

…Which made the final twist all the more shocking.

At the end of the journey, Bijou—along with Fuwawa, Mococo, Nerissa, and Shiori—turned against Fia and the remaining heroes.

_“After all, nothing stays pure,”_ the gem maiden said.
