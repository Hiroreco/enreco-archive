## Overview

Iphania—now known as Fia—was once the Princess of Ancient Libestal, and now serves as the keeper of [the Library](#entry:library-entry), the timeless sanctuary that lies beyond space and time. It was she who rescued the heroes from the destruction of the [fabricated world](#entry:libestal-ficta-entry), pulling them into the past not only to save their lives, but to ask a favor: to help her prevent [the Outsider](#entry:outsider-entry) from ever coming into existence.

## Details

### Backstory

Long ago in [Ancient Libestal](#entry:libestal-ancient-entry), the kingdom was ruled by Princess Iphania, the last of her royal bloodline. Both her parents, along with many close to her, had perished from the spreading corruption. The world was falling apart, and the Book of Prophecy foretold nothing but doom.

Despite the grim prophecies, Iphania refused to yield to despair. She continued to fight with unwavering resolve—even if it meant defying fate itself. Her unshakable will moved the heart of **the Watcher**, a divine observer tasked only with watching worlds play out.

Breaking his oath, the Watcher disguised himself as a swordsman, **the Outlander**, and fought to save the world at her side. Together, they succeeded: the Curse was slain, and the source of corruption destroyed.

But fate was cruel. A fragment of the Curse survived, hiding itself inside Iphania’s cherished doll. At the moment no one expected, it reemerged and struck her down. Though her body perished, Iphania’s soul lingered, clinging to the very doll that had caused her demise, and which now bore her spirit within.

As the world crumbled into ruin, her soul drifted through space and time, eventually finding refuge in the Library. The sanctuary preserved her essence, though in exchange, she could never leave. Taking on the name **Fia**, a nickname once given to her by the Outlander, she became the Library's eternal caretaker.

Bound within those walls, Fia could do little but reflect—on her kingdom’s fall, the Outlander’s punishment, and the cycle of despair that led to **the Outsider’s** creation. She longed to save them both but was powerless. That is, until she saw them—the heroes, her Shining Stars.

With new hope, she summoned them into the past, to a time one week before the pivotal moment of her world’s doom, praying they could succeed where she could not.

### Chapter 2

Upon first meeting the heroes, Fia explained the truth: the King they once knew was a fraud, the Outsider, who sought to destroy the universe. She asked for their aid, though she herself could not recall all the details, having lost fragments of her memory due to the strain of time travel.

She asked the heroes to help her recover what had been lost.
And so, they did.

Their journey took them through Ancient Libestal, where they met Iphania’s past self—a princess still fighting to defy destiny. Through dungeons, Star Sites, and battles, the heroes slowly pieced together Fia’s lost memories. With clarity regained, she proposed a new path: let the heroes take up the Outlander’s burden of saving the world so that he would not be punished, and the Outsider would never be born.

The heroes shared the truth with Iphania, who, alongside them, convinced the Outlander to relinquish his fate. He agreed. And the plan worked—they defeated [the Curse](#entry:heart-of-ruin-entry) and saved Libestal.

But just as victory was within reach, fate struck again.
The Curse reemerged during the celebration banquet, slaying Iphania in one final, merciless act.

Then, a higher and far more cryptic being appeared—shattering space itself. It condemned the Outlander for his betrayal, and the heroes for interfering with fate. Their punishment was imminent.

But Fia intervened, pulling the heroes back into the Library once more and leaping through time to escape the entity’s grasp. With this final time jump, all of her memories returned—her life as the Princess of Libestal, her tragic death, and how she came about as the current Librarian.

History had repeated itself. Once again, she failed to break fate.

Yet even now, she refused to give in. This time, rather than change the past, she asked the heroes to help her change the future. To do what they still could—here and now—and carve a new path forward.

Most of the heroes agreed without hesitation.
But not all.
**Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori** declared they would go their own path, unable—or unwilling—to follow Fia any further.
