## Overview

The Outsider was the one who first summoned all the heroes to the fabricated [Kingdom of Libestal](#entry:libestal-ficta-entry), posing as the benevolent king and deceiving them into freeing him from his ancient bindings. A being consumed by hatred and resentment toward the forces that once imprisoned him, he sought nothing less than the destruction of the universe as revenge. The heroes were the only ones standing in his way.

## Details

### Chapter 1

Nineteen heroes were summoned to the Kingdom of Libestal by its seemingly kind and gentle ruler. The king pleaded for their strength to save his realm from the growing threat of the Stains. His demeanor was compassionate, his motives appeared noble—and it was all a lie.

After the defeat of the Stain King, the monarch revealed his true identity. The so-called calamity had been orchestrated by him, and by defeating it, the heroes had unknowingly broken the seals on his prison. No longer bound, he shed his disguise and revealed his true form—**The Captive** (later known as **the Outsider**).

His intent was clear: to destroy all of existence as retribution for his imprisonment. But through the combined efforts of the heroes, he was ultimately struck down. However, as he fell, the very world began to collapse into the void. In the final moments, a mysterious entity intervened, pulling the heroes from the brink of annihilation.

### Chapter 2

The heroes were pulled back in time by **Fia** to the ancient era of Libestal, an age before the Outsider’s existence—in hopes of preventing his tragic birth altogether.

During their journey, they encountered a wandering, nameless swordsman, **the Outlander**, who was on his own mission to destroy the Heart of Ruin, the wellspring of corruption plaguing the land.

#### The Nameless Swordsman

**The Outlander**
Driven by purpose and haunted by knowledge, the Outlander fought to rid the world of its impending doom. However, during an expedition into the [Stronghold of Ruin](#entry:stronghold-of-ruin-entry), he was overtaken by the corruption and sealed within. The heroes, dispatched by Princess Iphania, were able to conquer the dungeon and free him.

Despite his rescue, the Outlander remained distant, skeptical of their resolve. He believed the burden of salvation fell solely upon him. Unbeknownst to him, that belief would lead to his downfall.

**The Watcher**
Eventually, his true identity was revealed: he was **The Watcher**, a member of the Collective, tasked only with observing worlds unfold—never intervening. Yet he had broken this sacred code. Inspired by Iphania’s bravery despite her doomed fate, he chose to abandon his post and rewrite the outcome, assuming the role of a nameless swordsman in order to defy destiny itself.

**The Outsider**
For this defiance, he was punished by the _Higher Being_—imprisoned for eternity within a fabricated reflection of the very kingdom he tried to save. As centuries passed, resentment turned to madness, and from that despair, the Outsider was born.

#### The Price for Defying Fate

After learning his fate and seeing the strength of the heroes firsthand, the Outlander relinquished his role. Trusting them with the task of saving the world, he stepped back. And they succeeded, slaying [the Curse](#entry:heart-of-ruin-entry), destroying the Heart of Ruin, and restoring peace.

But fate, it seemed, was not so easily undone. In a cruel twist, the Curse reemerged in its final moments and struck down Princess Iphania. The Outlander, devastated by grief, faced judgment once again. The mysterious Higher Being, who had been watching from beyond, declared that his betrayal of the Collective was irreversible. Imprisonment awaited him still. The cycle could not be broken—the Outsider would still be born.

Now, with the universe at stake and the truth of the past fully unveiled, the heroes must face their greatest challenge yet: stopping the Outsider once and for all.
