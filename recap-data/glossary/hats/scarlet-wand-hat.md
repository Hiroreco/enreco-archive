## Overview

The Scarlet Wand's hat is by far the longest and most absurd-looking one among all the guilds. It's long, pyramid-shaped, and red—it resembles a very suggestive shape, as pointed out by Shiori. Long story short, it's a pretty unique hat.

## Details

Its strange appearance is one thing, but the story it brought upon its wearers is another. The Scarlet Wand is the guild of the knowledgeable, yet instead of representing its intended meaning, the hat earned its wearers titles like "witches," misunderstood as granting the ability to read minds.

Gawr Gura was the first to acquire this hat and immediately felt a connection to it. She found it special, called it "the hat of the Appointed Point," and claimed only chosen ones could bear the responsibility of wearing it. She said it gave her immense power, and that if others wore it, they must wear it forever, as they would share an unbreakable bond—one where, if any chose to remove the hat, they would all perish. (Notice how the keyword is _claimed_.)

Bearers of this hat also has a sacred ritual , where they all gather around, lean forward and let their pointy tips touch each other. Why? Why not.
