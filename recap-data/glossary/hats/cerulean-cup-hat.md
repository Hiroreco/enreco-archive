## Overvie

The Cerulean Cup's hat bears the shape of a... balloon? Egg? Something blue? No one really knows for sure, but one thing's certain—it looks incredibly heavy for the wearer's head.

### <u>Story## Details

The hat represents the guild of the empathetic, though ironically, most members of the Cerulean Cup were anything but empathetic.

Its shape also vaguely resembles a diamond, as pointed out by Amelia—during a brief moment of confusion, when she mistakenly thought the Hot Pink One was her beloved.
