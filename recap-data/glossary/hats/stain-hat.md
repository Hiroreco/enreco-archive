### <u>Description</u>

The Stain Hat takes the shape of—well—a stain, that part’s obvious. What wasn’t obvious, however, was the implication it held. When placed atop the wearer’s head, it looked as though a stain was just casually sitting there. Cute at first glance, but little did they know, it was quietly corrupting their mind.

### <u>Story</u>

Koseki Bijou was one of the first to obtain this hat. As excited as she was to finally have any kind of hat, she put it on immediately. But as days passed, the Stain slowly seeped into her thoughts—until she was completely under its control.

The hat then commanded her to spread its corruption, and the moment anyone else put on the hat passed from the corrupted one, they too would fall under its influence (except for Shiori—she’s immune, for some reason).

To break free of the corruption, the hat must either be removed... or the wearer must drink a cure known as “The Essence of Empathy.”
