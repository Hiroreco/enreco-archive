## Overvie

The Jade Sword's hat served more like a helmet, most notable for the visor protecting the wearer's face. And of course, it's green—matching the color of its guild.

### <u>Story## Details

Each Jade Sword member took pride in their hat, especially those like Elizabeth and Calli—the latter even went as far as spending her entire savings (all 9 coins) to buy it from someone else.
