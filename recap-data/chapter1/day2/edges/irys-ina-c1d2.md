<!-- title: Eternal Consort -->

The Hot Pink One had been battling jealousy all day long. Gonathon’s wife, or as he called her, his Pearl, Jyonathan, was a beautiful blonde maiden—exactly the kind of person the pink lady dreamed of having by her side. Yet, this flower was already firmly planted in her pot. While the Hot Pink One kept whispering wishes under her breath for the bond between Gonathon and Jyonathan to falter, she couldn’t help but yearn for someone to call her own.

Miraculously, that wish would come true later in the day.

Inside the Ocean Temple Dungeon, the Hot Pink One surprised everyone with her sudden knack for solving puzzles. It was an unexpected display of brilliance for someone usually lost in her chaotic antics. She credited her newfound intelligence and luck entirely to Ina’s hat, which she now considered a talisman of inspiration. Emboldened by this revelation, the pink lady realized her growing feelings for Nino Ina and—without hesitation—proposed.

Huzzah! Ina accepted, declaring herself the Hot Pink One’s "eternal consort". The pair spent the rest of the day enjoying each other’s company, though it didn’t take long for cracks of skepticism to appear. The Hot Pink One’s odd habit of referring to her beloved as her ["bank account"](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared\&t=3773) raised eyebrows, with even [Calli](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?feature=shared\&t=12783) questioning her ability to remain loyal.

The pink lady dismissed all doubts with characteristic flair. To nurture this new bond, she resolved to scale back her antics and wild mingling.

Yet, her commitment seemed dubious when considering her earlier remarks about Gonathon’s wife, Jyonathan. The Hot Pink One had often joked that Jyonathan could be her "backup plan" should the marriage falter. While she swore these were harmless jokes, the line between jest and truth had always been blurry with her. Surely, the pink lady wouldn’t stoop so low as to pursue her guildmate’s beloved…right?
