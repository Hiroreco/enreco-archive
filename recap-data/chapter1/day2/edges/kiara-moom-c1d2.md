As Shakira was minding her own business, she stumbled upon a sight that she maybe shouldn’t have seen. Her guildmate, Darwin—one of the few she had left—was mingling with another guild.

Watching from a distance, Shakira saw Darwin among the Scarlet Wand members, donning a red hat and participating in their secretive rituals. A pang of betrayal struck her chest. The Amber Coin guild was already dwindling, especially after Peasant The Bae’s disappearance, and now it seemed on the verge of losing yet another member. If Darwin had truly defected, that would leave only her and her ever-reliable pink cat. The thought weighed heavily on her heart.

Later, however, Darwin approached Shakira in private. In a hushed tone, she revealed the truth—her apparent defection was all part of a larger plan. She had infiltrated the Scarlet Wand as a spy to gather information, and the red hat was merely a disguise. She even went as far as faking a reaction to gain pity from others.

Hearing this, Shakira sighed in relief and decided to let Darwin in on her own secret. As it turned out, she was also playing the role of a double agent, trying to gain the trust of the Cerulean Cup members in order to erase the bad reputation that Amber Coin had mysteriously garnered.

So, when looking at the bigger picture, it turned out that everyone had abandoned their guild for a mission of their own... meaning the only one truly left behind in Amber Coin was Raora.
