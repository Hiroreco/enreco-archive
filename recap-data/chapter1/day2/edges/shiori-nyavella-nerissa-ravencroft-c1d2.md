<!-- title: Keeping Company -->

Although no formal ceremony took place, Nerissa and Shiori might have been the first to establish what could be considered a married relationship. Technically, it began as a declaration from Nerissa (from day one), which Shiori simply went along with. However, their dynamic felt far more natural and genuine compared to the peculiar and often chaotic marriages that occurred throughout the day.

Despite their easygoing rapport, their conversations often veered into eyebrow-raising territory. While navigating the Ocean Temple Dungeon alone, Shiori began to feel lonely and decided to call Nerissa for company. One of her first requests? For Nerissa to leave her "mic" on during an "idol meeting".

Nonetheless, the two kept each other entertained throughout Shiori's dungeon crawl. Nerissa served as a steady emotional anchor while Shiori, struggling with the complex puzzles, teetered on the brink of losing her sanity. Their banter flowed effortlessly, almost as though they had known each other for years. Beneath their eccentric exchanges, it was clear they genuinely cared for one another, showcasing a bond that stood out amidst the chaos of the kingdom.
