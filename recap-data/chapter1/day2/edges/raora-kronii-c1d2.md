<!-- title: Fake Queen -->

The pink cat was really starting to get on Tam’s nerves. Just the day before, Tam had already endured an exhausting session trying to get Raora to pronounce her name correctly. Yet, here they were again—another day, another mispronunciation, followed by Raora’s laughter. Tam was already drained from a verbal clash with Elizabeth, and Raora couldn't miss that chance to mess with her temper.

She wanted to share her thoughts with Tam, especially since she took this whole "queen" business seriously. Raora mockingly pointed out that Tam was a queen without a castle—a jab made even sharper by the fact that Raora herself was in the process of building one. But Tam, visibly unbothered, walked away mid-conversation, leaving Raora to shout after her, calling her a "koward" (coward).

Later, in what seemed like a change of heart, Raora pulled Tam aside for a more formal discussion.

She proposed an alliance of sorts, suggesting that the two of them could both be queens—neither true nor fake—and rule the kingdom together. While Tam found the idea amusing, she still believed herself to be the worthier queen of the two. Their conversation was cut short when an eavesdropper interrupted, but Raora assured Tam that they’d continue the discussion later (they didn't).
