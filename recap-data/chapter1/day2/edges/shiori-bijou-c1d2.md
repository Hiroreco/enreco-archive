<!-- title: Seeds and Eggs -->

Bijou and Shiori had always shared peculiar conversations whenever they crossed paths. Their topics ranged from milking to eating shoes, as though the two operated on the same bizarre wavelength. At first, it seemed like harmless, friendly banter, but over time, Bijou found herself drawn to the Oreo lady in a way that felt deeper than just camaraderie. Something about Shiori's unique oddness [resonated](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=4011) with her own.

Inspired by the blossoming relationship between Gonathon and Jyonathan, Bijou mustered the courage to confess her feelings and propose to Shiori.

Their marriage ceremony was far from traditional. In the middle of an open field, with Stains attacking from all directions and wildlife as their only witnesses, they exchanged their "eggs" and "seeds." It was unconventional, chaotic, and perfectly fitting for two individuals whose weirdness seemed to define them.

Even the Grim Reaper herself, Calli, was unsettled by their union, backing away cautiously after their peculiar introduction. But love isn’t about conformity; it’s about finding someone who matches your rhythm, no matter how offbeat it might seem to others.

By the end of the day, love had undeniably bloomed. The two even shared a tender kiss to bid each other goodnight before retiring to their beds.
