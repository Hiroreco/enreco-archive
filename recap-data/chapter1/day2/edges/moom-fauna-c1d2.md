<!-- title: Shady Business -->

Darwin stumbled upon an under-construction FaunaMart, lured by the promise of cookies, treats, and candies—something akin to a family-friendly convenience store. To her dismay, however, she was instead greeted with advertisements for [lotteries and gambling](https://www.youtube.com/live/WQRPyJ4zhC0?feature=shared\&t=715). The brown maiden couldn't have been more disappointed, while Fauna, in stark contrast, was overjoyed to welcome her first customer.

Skeptical of the entire setup, Darwin raised an eyebrow at just about every aspect of Fauna’s operation. Fauna enthusiastically touted the "big jackpot," but conspicuously avoided specifying how big it actually was. She imposed [odd rules](https://www.youtube.com/live/WQRPyJ4zhC0?feature=shared\&t=855), like banning repeated numbers on the lottery tickets, and even claimed the proceeds would go toward a local library. However, when pressed, the "library" Fauna showcased barely had any books at all.

Darwin made her frustrations clear, documenting everything on her "vlog" with the intention of exposing FaunaMart's sketchy practices.

As the day went on and more adventurers joined the scene, Darwin worked tirelessly to warn them about the shady business. She managed to convince [Shakira](https://www.youtube.com/live/WQRPyJ4zhC0?feature=shared\&t=2300) to avoid the lottery, but to her dismay, FaunaMart began gathering a growing crowd of supporters. Even as Darwin pointed out the fine print on the lottery tickets—text that was so tiny it was clearly meant to deceive—Fauna stood her ground, buoyed by her newfound allies.

Though Darwin lost this particular battle, she wasn’t ready to give up. Determined to expose the truth about FaunaMart, she resolved to gather more evidence and take action at some point in the future.
