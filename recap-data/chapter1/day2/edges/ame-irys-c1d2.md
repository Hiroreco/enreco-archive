<!-- title: Plan B -->

You know you’ve got a jealousy issue when you hit on another person’s spouse not once, not twice, but so many times in a single day that even keeping count feels futile. And that’s exactly what the Hot Pink One did on her second day in this enigmatic journey.

Upon learning that Gonathon had tied the knot with Jyonathan, she initially expressed surprise but offered her congratulations nonetheless. However, meeting Jyonathan in person sparked something deeper—and much more mischievous.

The Hot Pink One couldn’t resist engaging in a bit of ["sweet talking"](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?feature=shared&t=623) with the cute blonde maiden, often hinting at desires that veered well beyond mere platonic admiration. Though she dismissed her flirtations as harmless jokes, her "lessons" for the newlyweds—focused on topics like divorce and the practicalities of splitting assets—carried an undercurrent of ulterior motives.

It was clear, at least to those paying attention, that she harbored a not-so-secret hope that such a scenario might unfold, one where she could swoop in and claim the maiden for herself. She even went as far as to offer to pay the [divorce fees](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?feature=shared&t=6469) herself, should the situation ever arise.

Amusingly, the title of "backup plan" wasn’t something the Hot Pink One claimed for herself—it was Jyonathan who coined it, raising more than a few eyebrows. Was Jyonathan truly satisfied with her current husband, or was there a spark of something else buried beneath the surface?

By the end of the day, the Hot Pink One did manage to gain a consort of her own, somewhat easing her yearning for companionship. Yet the fact remained: she still carried the title of Jyonathan’s "backup plan." Whether this playful flirtation would lead to future drama, or perhaps something even more profound, remains to be seen.
