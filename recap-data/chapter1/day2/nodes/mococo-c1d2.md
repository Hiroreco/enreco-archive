On her second day in the kingdom, the fuzzy one, Mococo, awoke with a sense of renewed determination. Her first day had been overwhelming—strange people, unfamiliar surroundings, and a whirlwind of emotions had left her quite shaken. But amidst all the chaos, there was a comforting presence: the lady in red, Elizabeth, who promised to always stay by her side. That promise gave Mococo a sense of ease.

Being the sociable doggo she was, Mococo wasted no time seeking companionship. She reached out to Raora and Elizabeth, asking if they’d be interested in tackling the second dungeon together. Both agreed, and with Fuwawa tagging along, Mococo eagerly set out to group up. During their gathering, Mococo brought up a new establishment she’d heard about—*FaunaMart*.

She had her eyes on the intriguing promise of lottery tickets being sold there. Before she could explain further, she received an ad call from Fauna herself, enthusiastically pitching the lottery and its grand prizes. While Elizabeth and Fuwawa seemed indifferent, Mococo was hooked. Without giving them much of a choice, she dragged the two to check out the shop.

At FaunaMart, Mococo dove right in and bought her first lottery ticket. She reasoned it was best to play it safe—after all, this could be a scam. Therefore, Mococo, being the responsible doggo that she was, bought only one, two, three...four...sixty-eight tickets. She spent every last coin she had, her tail wagging with excitement.

Elizabeth and Fuwawa exchanged worried glances as Mococo gleefully held her mountain of tickets, certain she’d struck gold. She assured Elizabeth that she’d soon be rich and promised to treat her friends once she hit the [jackpot](https://www.youtube.com/live/0rhoyO69kAQ?feature=shared\&t=1310). Elizabeth, though still concerned, wished her the best of luck.

With their detour to FaunaMart complete, the group returned to focus on their goal: the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. They regrouped with Shakira and Raora, their companions for the dungeon conquest. Upon learning of Mococo’s excessive ticket-buying spree, Shakira couldn’t help but question her [decision](https://www.youtube.com/live/0rhoyO69kAQ?feature=shared\&t=2368). Mococo was unbothered—she was determined that her decision was anything but wrong.

Getting back on track, the second dungeon proved challenging, but together, the group triumphed. They solved the puzzles, fought through peril, and recovered memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/0rhoyO69kAQ?feature=shared\&t=4851).

As the day drew to a close, Mococo felt fulfilled by their adventure. Her thoughts, however, lingered on the jackpot she was certain awaited her. With dreams of riches dancing in her mind, she settled down for the night, a smile on her face and her paws crossed for good fortune. As innocent as she was, this marked the beginning of a storyline nobody saw coming.
