After the chaos of the first day, Bijou, feeling a tinge of guilt (not really) for blowing all her money on gambling, decided she'd turn over a new leaf—at least for today. She resolved to be a "nice person" and help Shiori conquer the first dungeon, as Shiori hadn’t managed to finish it the day before. Jyon Watson found herself in a similar predicament, so she tagged along as well, enlisting Gonathon’s assistance.

Naturally, it wouldn’t be normal for these girls to proceed without some level of absurdity. Before entering the dungeon, a bizarre conversation unfolded—one involving the idea of milking Shiori, biting Bijou’s feet, and the questionable stains on the King’s pants.

After completing the dungeon, Bijou had the honor of witnessing Gonathon's [marriage](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=3111) to his wife, Jyon Watson. But, as if on cue, she soon caught the Hot Pink One attempting to flirt with the newlywed bride. Being the good guildmate she was, Bijou promptly alerted Gonathon, who rushed over to reclaim his [beloved](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=4490).

Having done her good deed for the day, Bijou then dragged her companions to the casino to indulge her gambling addiction, intent on finally earning enough money to buy the hat she had been longing for since day one.

Despite Bijou’s persistent invitations, Gonathon refused to enter the casino. As a man of principle, he couldn’t bring himself to step into the Amber Coin vicinity—it would be a betrayal of his ideals. Tired of his moral high ground and whining, Bijou hit him where it hurt.

Remember her earlier noble act of informing Gonathon about the Hot Pink One’s advances on his wife? Well, forget that. Bijou made a cruel but effective move: she called Gonathon, claiming the Hot Pink One was committing unspeakable acts with his Pearl. Gonathon, panicked and teary-eyed, sprinted to find his wife. It was all just a ruse, but it was as low as it was clever.

Having gambled her life away once again and educating Gonathon on how hand-holding could lead to [pregnancy](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=5401), the group decided to meet their queen, Tam Gandr. Gonathon explained to Tam about the FaunaMart lottery scam, and, unsurprisingly, the mere mention of "lottery" triggered Bijou’s gambling instincts. Like a wild beast, she bolted to the quest board, screaming ["Gacha! Gacha!"](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=6431) at the top of her lungs.

At the quest board, the group encountered Elizabeth, who challenged Tam to a duel. Ever the loyal servant, the Hot Pink One stepped up to fight in her queen’s stead and emerged [victorious](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=7239). Riding on her momentum, she challenged Bijou next. As expected of someone who spent most of her time gambling rather than honing her skills, Bijou was promptly defeated, losing not just the duel but also her dignity.

Later, the group’s antics continued—Bijou adopted a pet rock, only for the Hot Pink One to, uh, ["fart"](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=7926) on it, which allegedly [killed it](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=7856). Amidst all this, however, something truly significant occurred: mustering all her courage, Bijou confessed her love to Shiori. A small but peculiar ceremony followed, and the two consummated their union (see [Bijou-Shiori: Seeds and Eggs](#edge:shiori-bijou)).

Returning to the task at hand, the team regrouped and prepared to tackle the *Water Temple Dungeon*. Before entering, Ina hosted an auction for her hat. Although Bijou coveted the hat, she decided she wanted to earn one through her own [efforts](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=11244), so she refrained from bidding. Alongside Tam, Gonathon, and the Hot Pink One, Bijou successfully conquered the dungeon and helped recover memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y2LV1PUQ0S8?feature=shared&t=13002). Yet another marriage took place afterward, this time between the Hot Pink One and NinoIna.

After the dust settled, Bijou decided to test her luck one last time to win a hat before calling it a day. But alas, fortune was not on her side. She ended her day empty-handed and dejected, her dreams of a hat left unfulfilled.

Before she headed off, wooden shovel.
