Gura entered the fantasy world for her second day, her excitement evident as she proudly wore the [long red hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=482). This hat was no ordinary accessory; it symbolized intelligence and status, qualities Gura quickly claimed as her own.

She began her day at the quest board, where Fauna, Cecilia, Darwin Roosevelt DiCaprio Jr., and Shakira were deep in discussion about the FaunaMart lottery tickets. Darwin attempted to sell Gura a ticket, but she was already ahead of the game. According to Gura, those who wore the red hat shared a single brain.

She proved her point by revealing that, despite not being present, she already knew about the lottery tickets thanks to a prior conversation between Fauna, who was also donning the red hat, and Darwin. To solidify her claim, she tested Fauna by asking what she was thinking, and Fauna’s correct answer affirmed the power of the red hat.

The group then investigated the source of the day’s buzz: the under-construction *FaunaMart* convenience store. Fauna enthusiastically explained her lottery system and how it could benefit the kingdom, though Shakira remained skeptical. Cecilia stepped in, offering the allure of a ["German discount"](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=1123), a mysterious incentive that segued into a side quest where the group attempted to learn [German](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=1210).

After fully mastering German in just five minutes, their antics resumed as Fauna forced Gura to buy a lottery ticket, sprinkled with discussions about ["ice-breaking" videos](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=1785) and Darwin’s unused ["kindle"](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=1937).

They then turned their attention to gacha boxes, with Cecilia determined to win the long red hat and join the exclusive club. Her attempts ended in disappointment, but Darwin, in a twist of fate, won the hat on her first try. This unexpected outcome startled Gura, greatly.

She warned Darwin of the immense responsibility and stress tied to being part of the Appointed Points. Darwin solemnly accepted the role, sealing the pact with a ceremonial touching of tips.

With their new (unofficial) member in tow, the group attempted to scam Calli into buying [lottery tickets](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=2658) before bidding Fauna farewell and preparing for the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*.

As the conquest began, Gura felt a strange sense of familiarity. The oceanic decor, ~~aircrafts~~ [dolphin statues](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=5735), and subtle hints of lore stirred memories of a life long forgotten. It felt personal, as if this dungeon was somehow tied to her. Determined to uncover the truth, the group pushed forward through puzzles.

The challenges ranged from baby block-like mechanisms (which inexplicably [offended](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=5870) Gura) to intricate switches and a final contraption requiring them to [guide a dummy](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=6604) to its goal. Despite the difficulty, the team persevered, uncovering a hidden treasure: a music disc labeled "Reflect"—or, as Gura declared, her [mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=8434).

And with the dungeon cleared, the truth was revealed.

Gura wasn’t just any adventurer; she was The Gawr Gura, a shark girl who once called this underwater kingdom home. Bored with her life beneath the waves, she had fled to start anew on land.

Yet, her story of rebellion didn’t inspire admiration as [she had hoped](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=8786). Darwin, expecting royal lineage, was disillusioned to learn Gura was a commoner. Cecilia, anticipating a tragic tale, was taken aback to learn that Gura’s departure had plunged the kingdom into chaos—especially after she took its primary defense, the trident.

Their adventure continued at the tavern, where they celebrated with Gura’s newly acquired [music disc](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=9204), and the day once again closed off with some good ol' bits [gambling](https://www.youtube.com/live/bOIlLaFiiE4?feature=shared&t=9761).
