Calli’s second day in the kingdom began with a lively group conversation. Among the crowd, she congratulated the newlyweds, Gonathon G and Jyon Watson. As Jyon was her guildmate, Calli made sure to extract a promise from Gonathon to take good care of his [wife](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared\&t=704). Soon after, she encountered another newlywed couple—Shiori and Bijou. This pair, however, had a rather peculiar dynamic that left Calli feeling more concerned than celebratory.

Seeing so many couples getting married sparked a sudden idea in Calli’s mind. Why not capitalize on the inevitable fallouts? What if she built a diner specializing in divorce services? Originally planning for a simple diner, she quickly pivoted to the more lucrative and unique angle of offering food alongside divorce consultations.Calli was convinced this genius idea would make her rich. Fueled by excitement, she set out to lay the foundation of her new [venture](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared\&t=1775).

Once the basic structure of her diner was complete, Calli realized she needed to spread the word. She headed to the tavern to announce her grand business idea. However, to her disappointment, every married couple she approached rejected the concept outright, some with outrage.

Undeterred by the backlash, Calli pressed on, coming up with a catchy slogan: ["Save your money, lose your honey"](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared\&t=2550)

Later in the day, Calli joined a team to tackle the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. Her group included Nerissa, Jyon, and Ina. Together, they wracked their brains to solve the dungeon’s puzzles and eventually succeeded, recovering the memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared\&t=5368).

As they emerged from the dungeon, Calli witnessed yet another impulsive wedding—this time between Ina and the Hot Pink One. While the rest of the group celebrated the union, Calli quietly smirked. She wasn’t cheering for their happiness but for the potential future customers her business might attract. ["They all start off so naive"](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared\&t=5828), she mused as the newlyweds declared their eternal love. By now, Calli had a fitting name for her establishment:

[*"Until Death Do You Part".*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?t=5879)

Back in the kingdom, Calli resumed the diner’s construction. At some point, she received a [prank call](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared\&t=8313) from Bijou, likely in retaliation for her constant jabs about Shiori and Bijou’s marriage falling apart.

Reflecting on her new venture, Calli began to reconsider its premise. The harsh reception from the kingdom’s couples made her realize that her idea might be a little too cruel. As Calli had the revelation, she decided to revise her business model. She'd no longer be selling any kind of divorce services...instead, they'd come free with any meal purchased, [free of charge](https://www.youtube.com/live/oPKmSO7XtoY?feature=shared\&t=8229). Oh, Calli.

Calli held great hopes for her diner’s future. Love, after all, often ends in heartbreak, and when it did, she knew people would come for the divorces and stay for the food.
