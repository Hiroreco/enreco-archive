Fauna had a revelation after her first day in the kingdom. Saving the kingdom? Too boring. Adventuring? Meh. What truly sparked joy was something far more practical—*money*. It felt like destiny, she reasoned, considering her green hue was the same color as wealth. And so, on her second day, Fauna made a bold declaration: goodbye main quest, hello NPC life. Thus, *FaunaMart* was born.

The concept of FaunaMart was as ingenious as it was dubious: a convenience store selling daily goods and necessities at a premium price and lower quantities than any reasonable competitor. Totally not a scam. But Fauna didn’t stop there; her real moneymaker was the store’s centerpiece—*lottery tickets*.

For 10 coins apiece, customers could try their luck, with the promise that 10% of the proceeds would fund the construction of a community library, while 30% would go straight into her pockets.

Construction of the cozy, wooden shop [began](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared\&t=3387), and Fauna envisioned a charming establishment that would eventually sit beside the promised library (once the shop was complete, of course). It wasn’t long before Fauna found her first ~~victim~~ customer (see [Darwin-Fauna: Shady Business](#edge:moom-fauna))

With her first sale secured, Fauna spread the word to her guildmate Cecilia, recruiting her to help sell more tickets. Together, they approached Shakira, but the orange lady proved a tough nut to crack. Shakira wasn’t just skeptical; she accused Fauna of exploiting people and declared the lottery an obvious *scam*. She even threatened to report Fauna to the queen, Tam Gandr. But Fauna, unfazed, dismissed the threat as an opportunity for free advertising.

After Shakira stormed off, Fauna and her guildmates resumed their day. They embarked on a brief side quest to learn [German](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared\&t=12106), witnessed Darwin winning the coveted long red hat from the gacha (and joining the red hat club via [tip-touching ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared\&t=13042)), and engaged in their usual shenanigans. Fauna also had a hilarious encounter with Calli, who managed to outsmart her during an attempt to sell [more tickets](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared\&t=13530).

As the day progressed, Fauna had to part ways with her guild before the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. However, not one to miss an opportunity, she turned to telemarketing to promote FaunaMart. Her unconventional approach involved reaching out to potential customers like Bijou, Fuwawa, Mococo, and Elizabeth, the latter being understandably startled when Fauna seemed to speak directly into her mind.

Despite the cheapness of the tactic, it proved effective, bringing in three [new customers](https://www.youtube.com/live/eUQWfgVwwpo?feature=shared\&t=15005). Elizabeth and the doggos alone contributed significantly to Fauna’s sales, with Mococo purchasing a whopping 68 tickets. FaunaMart, it seemed, was off to a booming start.

Business was flourishing, and Fauna’s entrepreneurial spirit showed no signs of slowing down. But as promising as her future appeared, one couldn’t help but wonder: would her questionable business practices eventually lead to lawsuits? Only time would tell.
