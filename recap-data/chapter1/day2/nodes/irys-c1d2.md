The day began with bold intentions from the Hot Pink One, whose first move was to stir up some drama. Targeting Gonathon's newly wedded wife, Jyonathan, at the quest board, the Pink One adopted a flirtatious demeanor, her motives unclear but certainly mischievous. Fortunately, Bijou quickly notified Gonathon, who dashed to the scene and interrupted the Pink One’s antics. His wife was safe, at least for the moment (see [Hot Pink One-Jyonathan: Plan B](#edge:ame-irys)).

After the interruption, Bijou invited the group to the Amber Coin casino to try their luck. Despite being part of the Guild of Empathy, Bijou was surprisingly enthusiastic about gambling. The Hot Pink One, while losing her coins at the tables, couldn't help but envy Gonathon, wishing for someone special in her life. Gonathon offered her encouragement, assuring her that her special someone would come along eventually.

Later, the group regrouped with their queen, Tam Gandr, where Gonathon explained the FaunaMart-run lottery scam plaguing the kingdom. The mere mention of lotteries immediately piqued the Hot Pink One’s interest, prompting her to dash off under the excuse of ["examining the evidence"](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=aZFVkqHOS5Ib3_sH&t=2531). It wasn't until her queen’s stern intervention that she was finally reeled [back in](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=nZQemPteok063cLW&t=2750).

At the quest board, Elizabeth also appeared, and the Hot Pink One couldn’t forget the indignity of having her gums 'hushed' by the Red One. When Elizabeth challenged Tam to a duel, the Hot Pink One boldly volunteered, determined to reclaim her [dignity](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=WTxfOOnZS6zsf83c&t=3123). Though her courage [wavered](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=5r5vNNmzoIjXRPGu&t=3136) briefly upon seeing Elizabeth’s formidable weapon, she pressed on nonetheless.

In the duel, the Hot Pink One emerged victorious. Elizabeth’s excuses about a "Ping Ghost" didn’t matter—victory was hers. Empowered by her win, she sought another opponent to satiate her newfound hunger for battle. She turned to Bijou and challenged her guildmate to a [duel](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=A-sxFCAwk8h7m671&t=3638). Another win followed, leaving Bijou defeated and the Hot Pink One now claiming [double](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=oNpLE1mN_HFpM6Jf&t=3666) the dignity, whatever that meant.

The day’s events continued with the Pink One 'accidentally' killing Bijou’s pet [rock](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=purywjxey_noU_DD&t=3974), partying at the [tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=0B4-qaOCsa2OupoT&t=6275), and finally preparing for the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*.

At the dungeon’s entrance, the group discussed how their teams should be split, with the Pink One joining Gonathon, Tam, and Bijou. Meanwhile, NinoIna mentioned auctioning her hat. Initially uninterested, the Pink One’s demeanor shifted entirely when she learned the hat carried Ina’s scent. Fueled by newfound enthusiasm, she purchased the hat for a steep 600 coins.

Inside the Ocean Temple Dungeon, the Hot Pink One surprised everyone, including herself, by excelling at puzzles—a rarity given her usual disposition. She credited her newfound intellect to Ina’s hat, which she now considered a source of luck and inspiration. Her team successfully conquered the dungeon, recovering memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/f8W426vzTb8?si=X8em6vc_K7PpG1Mh&t=9178).

Feeling emboldened by her achievements and newfound clarity, the Pink One realized her feelings for NinoIna and proposed (see [Hot Pink One-Ina: Eternal Consort](#edge:irys-ina).)
