One of the first things Cecilia did on her first day was have a conversation with Shakira in German, a language only the two of them knew. And, in a similar fashion, one of the first things Cecilia did on the second day was, you guessed it, another conversation with Shakira in [German](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=394). It seems fair—when you're one of only two people fluent in some ancient, mystic language, you make use of it.

During her morning greetings, Fauna approached Cecilia to introduce her new business venture: _FaunaMart_, a convenience store selling daily necessities and, of course, the star product—lottery tickets. Cecilia was intrigued and decided to support her fellow green compatriot by buying four tickets.

Since they were both in the same guild, Scarlet Wand, Cecilia went a step further and helped Fauna sell more tickets. She even tried convincing Shakira to buy some, offering her a special discount. Scam or not, Cecilia felt it was her duty to support Fauna’s efforts as a fellow entrepreneur.

Not long after, Cecilia demonstrated to Fauna, Gura, and Darwin how she learned German in three minutes during a self-made [sidequest](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=1401). The quest involved talking to random German-speaking civilians and, somehow, just by listening, gaining the skill as if in a video game. The group was skeptical but impressed, especially when Darwin managed to speak [fluently](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=1537) after only a short while. Oddly enough, her voice seemed to change slightly whenever she spoke German, but everyone chalked it up to their imagination.

Cecilia then decided it was time to try her luck at obtaining a red hat—an item many of her guildmates already owned. Unfortunately, she had no success, while Darwin, who didn’t even need the hat, got one on her first try. Cecilia was visibly disappointed, but her friends rallied around her to cheer her up, combining their long hats into a [small tipi](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=2471) as a gesture of support.

The day continued with Cecilia joining Fauna in trying to sell lottery tickets to Calli, the Grim Reaper herself. However, the tables quickly turned, and the two found themselves on the [receiving end](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=2754) of a scam instead. Business ventures aside, Cecilia’s sharp mind began noticing oddities about the kingdom.

She shared her suspicions with Fauna, Gura, and Darwin, theorizing that the King might be turning the kingdom’s people into the "Stains" they were sent to fight. What’s more, despite being tasked with clearing dungeons, there were no Stains to be found in them. Her suspicions deepened after overhearing and overanalyzing the words (a bug) of a civilian.

After wrapping up their conspiracy discussions, Cecilia, Gura, and Darwin headed to the second dungeon, the _Ocean Temple Dungeon_. After navigating multiple puzzles—and, of course, [overthinking](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=8274) most of them—they successfully completed the dungeon and helped Gawr Gura recover her lost [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=8878).

Exhausted from the mental gymnastics, the group decided to unwind at the casino. Cecilia, just like on the first day, bet all her money on green—and [lost it all](https://www.youtube.com/live/a74NeBcixi8?feature=shared&t=9993). Undeterred, she roamed the area looking for someone to lend her money. She eventually found Gonathon, who agreed to trade 9 sticks for 50 coins. With newfound confidence, Cecilia returned to the casino, bet everything on green once more... and lost it all again.
