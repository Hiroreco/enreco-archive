<!-- title: Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

As the knight in red stirred from her slumber, fragments of a memory surfaced—a faint recollection from day one. It was the moment Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame had sworn her unwavering loyalty to the fuzzy dog, Mococo. This memory wasn’t just a fleeting thought but a cornerstone of who she was, a defining piece of her identity. Elizabeth’s journey would be marked by such recollections, each day unearthing a new fragment that shaped her character and story.

With the memory fading into the background, Elizabeth prepared to enter the kingdom. Upon arrival, she was greeted warmly by the doggy duo, [Fuwawa and Mococo](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=933). Their lively chat quickly set the tone for the day. Mococo excitedly asked if Elizabeth would join them in tackling the second dungeon and if she’d heard of the newly established FaunaMart.

Just as Elizabeth began to respond, an unexpected voice echoed in her mind. It was Fauna, delivering a telepathic advertisement for her new business.

The Scarlet Knight froze, startled by the direct intrusion into her thoughts. To Elizabeth, this wasn’t just clever marketing—it was witchcraft. The idea of a "witch" targeting her so brazenly filled her with unease, and she began to suspect that Fauna might wield dark powers.

Despite her apprehension, Elizabeth accompanied Fuwawa and Mococo to FaunaMart. The doggos, especially Mococo, seemed eager to investigate this mysterious store that sold lottery tickets.

At the shop, Fauna welcomed them with her usual charm and started explaining how the lottery system worked. Elizabeth, however, remained vigilant, keeping a watchful eye on Fauna’s every move. To her, the long red hat Fauna wore was the mark of a witch, and she couldn’t shake the feeling that danger lurked beneath Fauna’s cheerful [demeanor](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=1231).

Mococo, unbothered by Elizabeth’s suspicions, decided to buy not one, not two, but sixty-eight lottery tickets. The sheer extravagance left both Elizabeth and Fuwawa stunned, their concern growing with each ticket Mococo [purchased](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=1615).

After bidding farewell to the "witch," the group turned their attention to the day’s main quest: conquering the _Ocean Temple Dungeon_. Joining Elizabeth and the doggos were Shakira and Raora. The journey was fraught with challenges, including several failed attempts and plenty of [trolling](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=4122), but their persistence paid off. By the end of the ordeal, they emerged victorious, recovering memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=5143).

Returning to the kingdom, Elizabeth encountered a figure she had taken an instant disliking to on the first day—Tam Gandr, the self-proclaimed queen. Fueled by her distaste, Elizabeth wasn't going to let the azure maiden get the better of her this time (see [Elizabeth-Tam: Some queen, eh?](#edge:liz-kronii)).

Later on, Elizabeth refocused her efforts. She joined Shakira in uncovering the first dungeon’s secret treasure, a hidden music disc. The day ended on a brighter note as the group celebrated their success with a lively party at the [tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/M3cuDNZrIKM?feature=shared&t=10446).
