Nerissa made her debut on day two, joining mid-conversation with her (self-proclaimed) wife, Shiori, who at the time was soloing the second dungeon. Their exchange went as expected for any "married" couple—playful flirting mixed with odd and suggestive banter (see [Shiori-Nerissa: Keeping Company](#edge:shiori-nerissa)).

Nerissa then had her first visit to the casino, and beginner’s luck seemed to be on her side. While the other three were losing both their coins and their sanity, Nerissa was winning every single round. By the end, she’d amassed a staggering 1,500 coins—leaving her two guildmates far behind with just 10 coins... or even none.

Later, with her newfound wealth, Nerissa went to check out the much-anticipated duel between Elizabeth and the Hot Pink One. Unfamiliar with the context, she simply observed with amusement, smiling as the chaos unfolded. At one point, she tried sparking a conversation with Jyon Watson. However, her natural womanizing aura led Gonathon to mistakenly assume she was flirting with his wife, earning her a sharp scolding.

Nerissa then began construction on a humble [pink house](https://www.youtube.com/live/nHn2JKHTyzM?feature=shared&t=4996) to serve as a communal storage and hangout space for her Scarlet Wand guildmates. She even managed to get her hands on the [coveted long hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/nHn2JKHTyzM?feature=shared&t=6016) she'd been eyeing.

While she paused construction to join the other heroes on a journey to the _Ocean Temple Dungeon_, Nerissa found herself in a team with Ina, Calli, and Jyon. Together, they completed the dungeon and recovered memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/nHn2JKHTyzM?feature=shared&t=8401). Afterward, she returned to finish her pink abode, satisfied with the end [result](https://www.youtube.com/live/nHn2JKHTyzM?feature=shared&t=10367).

As if it were a custom for these girls, she decided to conclude her day with another trip to the casino. But beginner's luck only lasts for so long, and this time around, fortune wasn’t on her side.

Round after round, she kept losing. The voices in her head begged her to stop for her own good, but like any true addict, she kept going, muttering, "just one more round." Despite starting the day as one of the richest heroes with over 1,500 coins, by the end, Nerissa had whittled her fortune down to a mere... 92.
