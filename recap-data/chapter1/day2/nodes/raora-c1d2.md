The big pink cat awoke from her slumber, feeling fully refreshed and ready for mischief. As soon as she arrived, she greeted Shakira and Gonathon, and, wasting no time, Raora seized the chance to tease Gonathon, tricking him into kneeling before [her](https://www.youtube.com/live/qDhyA4-79ko?feature=shared&t=524). She knew all too well that his loyalty was solely reserved for Tam Gandr, the so-called "fake queen," as Raora often referred to her.

Her disdain for Tam ran deep, and she took the moment to try and sway Shakira, claiming that she, Raora, was the true queen while Tam was nothing more than a pretender.

Getting back on track, Raora refocused on the day’s main objective: the _Ocean Temple Dungeon_. She assembled her team, including Shakira, Elizabeth, and the two doggos, and together they embarked on the challenging journey. The adventure was anything but quiet, with bursts of shouting and chaotic moments scattered [throughout](https://www.youtube.com/live/qDhyA4-79ko?feature=shared&t=3654), but their determination paid off. In the end, they successfully recovered the memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/qDhyA4-79ko?feature=shared&t=4663).

Upon their return, they found themselves face-to-face with Tam Gandr and her guildmates at the quest board. Shakira knelt before Tam and brought up her concerns about the suspicious FaunaMart scam. Shakira’s act of loyalty was also a statement of trust—she saw Tam as the rightful ruler, much to Raora’s visible [displeasure](https://www.youtube.com/live/qDhyA4-79ko?feature=shared&t=6292). Raora couldn’t help but feel that Shakira’s allegiance should lie with her instead.

Later in the day, Raora crossed paths with Tam again, this time finding her in a heated argument with Elizabeth. Sensing an opportunity to rile up Tam, she wasted no time stirring the pot (see [Raora-Tam: Fake Queen](#edge:raora-kronii)).

After cooling off, Raora joined Shakira in revisiting the first dungeon to uncover its secret treasure. They managed to retrieve a hidden music disc, which became the centerpiece of a celebratory evening at the [tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/qDhyA4-79ko?feature=shared&t=9968). Together, they reveled in their small victory, their bond strengthened by the shared adventure.
