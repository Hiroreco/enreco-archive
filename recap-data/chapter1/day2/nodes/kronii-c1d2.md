The new (self-proclaimed) *Queen of Libestal* awoke for the second day, and it seemed action was the theme of the day. As soon as Tam joined the kingdom, Bijou summoned her for [immediate assistance](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared\&t=307), while informing her that Gonathon had been wedded. At the same time, Tam received a secret message from Shakira about an evil force—FaunaMart—scamming people through lottery tickets. Intrigued, the Queen wasted no time and hurried to join her guildmates.

When she arrived, the first thing everyone pointed out was her "Xbox-like" [voice](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared\&t=561). Tam, being self-conscious about it, tried to brush it off but couldn’t help feeling embarrassed.

Regardless, there were more pressing matters. Gonathon explained the lottery scam situation, but at the mention of "lottery," both Bijou and the Hot Pink One, notorious gambling addicts, dashed to the quest board. Tam's desperate attempts to stop them were futile, and with no other choice, she followed her reckless guildmates.

At the quest board, Shakira shared more about the scams. Midway through, Elizabeth appeared, reigniting her rivalry with Tam. Liz, unaware of Tam's name, referred to her as "Tim," much to Tam's irritation. Insults flew—Tam calling Liz a "red thing" and a harlot, sentencing her to death, while Liz retaliated with equal fervor. The heated exchange reached its peak when Liz challenged Tam to a duel ([see Elizabeth-Tam: Some queen, eh?](#edge:liz-kronii)).

Tam, as Queen, declared the duel beneath her—not out of fear, of course—but because violence, she claimed, was unbecoming of royalty. Instead, she requested that a subordinate take her place. The Hot Pink One volunteered, eager to settle her score with Liz. After an intense battle, the Pink One emerged victorious, to Tam's delight.

Tam's day carried on with the usual shenanigans: completing quests, sharing a [sensual moment](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared\&t=2332) with Shiori, being called "queen dum dum" by Calli, and much more.

Eventually, the group prepared for the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. After clearing its challenges and recovering Gawr Gura’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared\&t=7458), Tam witnessed another guildmate's marriage. This time, the [Hot Pink One](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared\&t=8043). This time, it kind of stung.

Tam later admitted she had feelings for the Pink One, making this yet another reminder of her loneliness. Though accustomed to being alone, the sight of her wedded guildmates left her longing for someone special. Nevertheless, Tam continued her day; she was queen after all, and queens never cry (see [Tam-Hot Pink One: Unrequited Love](#edge:irys-kronii)).

Tam thought that at the very least, she could provide shelter for her followers. Despite her envy, she still treasured them deeply. With this resolve, Tam set out to build the [guild base](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared\&t=11310).

With occasional help from Gonathon and Ina, and after overcoming moments of [frustration](https://www.youtube.com/live/fIGfh8GmKY8?feature=shared\&t=17819), the foundation slowly began to take shape. She hoped to finish it soon; as her departure for important business loomed closer, she feared that she would soon not be able to spend more time with her silly friends. Tam wished that by the time she left, her guildmates would have a place they could call home.
