Upon re-entering the kingdom, Fuwawa teamed up with Mococo to seek companions for a dungeon expedition. Their search led them to Liz, and as the trio exchanged pleasantries, their conversation was interrupted by a peculiar advertisement call from Fauna, promoting her new business venture, [FaunaMart](https://www.youtube.com/live/jjCVWFJl-_o?feature=shared\&t=665). While Fuwawa was only mildly interested in the pitch, Mococo was thoroughly intrigued. Her excitement dragged both Fuwawa and Liz to the newly opened convenience store.

Fuwawa decided to try her luck and purchased a single [lottery ticket](https://www.youtube.com/live/jjCVWFJl-_o?feature=shared\&t=903). Mococo, on the other hand, went all in, buying an astonishing sixty-eight tickets. Fuwawa grew visibly concerned, quietly telling Liz she worried Mococo would run out of money for essentials like food.

As Mococo painstakingly listed all sixty-eight of her ticket numbers, Fuwawa’s patience wore thin; with each new number called, her annoyance grew visibly (see [Fuwawa-Mococo: Same But Different](#edge:fuwawa-mococo)).

With the lottery escapade behind them, the group turned their attention back to preparing for the *Ocean Temple Dungeon*. Along the way, they encountered other adventurers. Fuwawa, ever curious, was captivated by the Scarlet Wand members and their striking long [red hats](https://www.youtube.com/live/jjCVWFJl-_o?feature=shared\&t=1594). Later on, her innate clumsiness got the better of her, and she wandered off into a random area, momentarily [getting lost](https://www.youtube.com/live/jjCVWFJl-_o?feature=shared\&t=2257).

Eventually, the party made its way into the dungeon. The labyrinth was filled with challenging puzzles, and Fuwawa’s empty-headed moments and occasional [screams](https://www.youtube.com/live/jjCVWFJl-_o?feature=shared\&t=5170) punctuated the adventure. Despite her frequent distractions, the group managed to overcome the obstacles and recovered memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/jjCVWFJl-_o?feature=shared\&t=4848).

Satisfied with the day’s achievements, Fuwawa decided to call it a night.
