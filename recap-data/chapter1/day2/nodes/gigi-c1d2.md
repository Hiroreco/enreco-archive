The second day began with Gonathon diving straight into action. Tasked with assisting in clearing the Underworld Dungeon alongside Jyon, Bijou, and Shiori, Gonathon found himself in peculiar company. Jyon and Shiori hadn’t managed to conquer the dungeon on the first day, so this was their chance to catch up.

However, before venturing into the depths, a bizarre conversation unfolded, leaving Gonathon bewildered. The group revisited their shared goal of slaying the King—a plan initially sparked by Jyon’s motives. For Gonathon, the King’s corruption was a reason to free him. For the others? The goal seemed more… recreational.

After clearing the dungeon, Gonathon’s day only grew more eventful. A surprising twist came in the form of a small marriage ceremony, binding him and *Jyonathan* in holy—or perhaps chaotic—matrimony (see [Gonathon-Jyonathan: My Pearl!](#edge:gigi-ame-top-2-bottom-2)).

The day wasn’t done with its events. Joined by his guildmates, Gonathon reported recent kingdom happenings to Queen Tam Gandr, including a scam orchestrated by the Scarlet Wand guild involving fraudulent [lottery tickets](https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared\&t=5324). At the quest board, while seeking more information about the scam from Shakira, the group encountered Elizabeth, sparking immediate tension. Cerulean Cup braced for confrontation.

A duel was proposed, and the Hot Pink One volunteered to fight in her Tam's [steed](https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared\&t=5963). Amidst these antics, Cecilia ~~stole~~ asked Gonathon if he were able to lend her 50 coins, after ~~lying~~ saying she was Jyon's guild mate, to which Gonathon, representing that of empathy, did exactly just that. The loan was never [repaid](https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared\&t=6001).

The duel concluded with a victory for the Hot Pink One, allowing everyone to continue with their day. Gonathon, ever the romantic after his own whirlwind marriage, encouraged Bijou to confess her feelings to Shiori. She did, and the confession culminated in another accepted marriage—love seemed to be the theme of the day.

As the day neared its end, preparations for the *Ocean Temple Dungeon* began. Joined by the Hot Pink One, Bijou, and Tam, Gonathon conquered the dungeon and recovered memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/kB2jUKUsxtE?feature=shared\&t=12043). Not long after, another marriage ceremony unfolded, this time uniting the *Hot Pink One and Nino Ina*. What a wonderful occasion this day has been, he thought. He experienced, for the first time, the touch of another’s affection, and watching his guildmates embrace similar happiness only added to the warmth he felt.
