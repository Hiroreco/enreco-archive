Ina re-entered the fantasy world for her second day, the chaos of the first still fresh in her mind. Yet, somehow, the absurdity of her guildmates had already become her new normal. The moment she arrived, she found herself dragged into a [lively tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=364), where familiar tunes blared, and her companions, along with other guild members, danced with reckless abandon. Ina didn’t comment much, though; she had grown accustomed to this bizarre kingdom.

Soon after, the Hot Pink One approached her, [inviting her](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=816) to join in the conquest of the _Ocean Temple Dungeon_.

Before the dungeon crawl began, Ina decided to hold an auction for her [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=1050). The bidding started with mild interest, but things escalated quickly when Ina casually mentioned that the hat carried her scent. That one detail flipped a switch in the Hot Pink One, who had initially shown no interest but suddenly offered a staggering 600 coins.

With the auction concluded, Ina assembled her team, which included Nerissa, Calli, and Jyon, and together they tackled the dungeon.

The team emerged victorious, recovering memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=3134) along the way.

After leaving the dungeon and taking a moment to mine for materials, Ina was pulled aside by the Hot Pink One. What followed was an unexpected and heartfelt proposal. The pink lady attributed their success to Ina’s hat and confessed that Ina was her one and only. Touched by the gesture, Ina accepted and vowed to be her eternal consort, sealing their unconventional union (see [Hot Pink One-Ina: Eternal Consort](#edge:irys-ina)).

Ina’s day continued in her signature serene fashion. Unlike most, she avoided the kingdom’s typical madness. She took on quests, explored the land, and engaged in calm conversations—an unusual rarity in a realm dominated by chaos. Even during her interactions with her guildmates, she maintained a steady demeanor, though her wife’s overly [questionable comments](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=4239) often drew a subtle smile.

There were some quirky moments amidst her otherwise tranquil day. Ina, in a rare slip, attempted to flirt with Tam, an incident she quickly brushed off as a result of her "Oya Oya" charm.

She then spent time observing Calli’s "dad-like" [tendencies](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=7411), which drew genuine laughter from Ina. She also encountered Nerissa and smugly flaunted her diamond sword. These one-off interactions offered a refreshing change and gave her a chance to better understand the kingdom’s many personalities.

As night fell, Ina made an unusual decision: she chose to tackle the Ocean Temple Dungeon solo for a [second time](https://www.youtube.com/live/z4R10dPeuwY?feature=shared&t=9950). Perhaps she was drawn to the thrill of "solo leveling," relishing the challenge it offered.
