Shiori, having missed the chance to tackle the first dungeon on the first day, decided to make it her first task on day two. She enlisted the help of Koseki Bijou and Jyon, with the latter also having not ventured into the dungeon yet.

While waiting for their fourth teammate, a bizarre, chaotic, and utterly Shiori-esque conversation unfolded. Somehow, the three managed to diverge the conversation topic from simple introductions to discussions about milking, biting feet, and eating. Peculiar topics had become par for the course when Shiori was around.

Anyway, back to the matter at hand. The group successfully conquered the dungeon, and though Shiori was a bit late to the party, she managed to recover memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=2480). Following this achievement, she witnessed the marriage ceremony of Gonathon and Jyon Watson (almost derailing it with one of her offhand [comments](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=2936)) and then took a slight detour to the [casino](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=3553).

Later, Shiori ventured to the entrance of the second dungeon, the _Ocean Temple Dungeon_. She had initially planned to tackle 'the land of the moist world' with Koseki Bijou, but Bijou was already committed to joining her guildmates. Undeterred, Shiori reached out to others for help, but everyone was busy. So, in a moment of boldness (or recklessness), she decided to attempt the dungeon [solo](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=4066).

Barely a minute into the dungeon, Shiori began to feel the sting of solitude. Seeking some semblance of company, she contacted Nerissa via the telekinesis device, filling the silence with random chatter (see [Shiori-Nerissa: Keeping Company](#edge:shiori-nerissa)).

But as the dungeon progressed, her initial confidence gave way to mounting frustration. The puzzles proved far more challenging than anticipated, and Shiori’s patience quickly wore thin.

She spent over ten minutes grappling with the second puzzle and another fifteen painstakingly trying to unlock a secret treasure chest—mistakenly believing it was necessary to progress. When she finally realized it was optional, her frustration hit its [peak](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=6303). However, after much struggle, she managed to conquer the dungeon, recovering memories of [Gawr Gura](https://www.youtube.com/live/LTIq_0ykLVA?feature=shared&t=6804). The victory brought a mix of pride and exhaustion.

After the mental ordeal, Shiori returned to the kingdom to unwind. At one of the taverns, she encountered Tam Gandr, engaging in a surprisingly sensual conversation (they only showed each other their weapons, don't get it twisted).

The day ended on an unexpected note when Bijou confessed her feelings to Shiori. To her own surprise, Shiori accepted, and the two consummated their newfound relationship... in front of the cows (see [Bijou-Shiori: Seeds and Eggs](#edge:shiori-bijou)).
