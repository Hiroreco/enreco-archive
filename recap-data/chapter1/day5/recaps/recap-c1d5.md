## Day 5: Love, Laugh, Lawsuit

A lot went down on this day. First and foremost: the lottery situation. Mococo wasn’t about to let the previous day’s events slide, so she confronted FaunaMart to set things straight—this time, with her trusty lawyer by her side. But Fauna and her gang, especially Nerissa, weren’t backing down either. And so, the two sides engaged in an intense legal battle, arguments flying back and forth as they fought to prove their case. Later on, after clearing up the misunderstanding from the previous day, Elizabeth and Nerissa were back to their usual shenanigans. However, this time, their playful back-and-forth turned even more lovey-dovey. The two spent the entire day together, practically glued at the hip. Well, it was mostly Nerissa sticking to Elizabeth—the blue lady simply refused to leave the knight alone.

Not only that, but this day was side chick galore. The Hot Pink One, finally unleashing her true potential, went on a spree, collecting side chicks left and right, until she was surrounded by a polygamous entourage of women everywhere she went.

Finally, getting back to the actual main quests, the heroes tackled their last dungeon in the kingdom—the [_Ancient Sewer Dungeon_](https://x.com/hololive_En/status/1831512579405181432)

. Unlike the previous dungeons, this one was less about brute force and more about wit, with puzzles designed to test the heroes' recollection of everything they had learned during their time in the kingdom. And upon conquering it, they were rewarded with a Warp Crystal, crafted by none other than [Amelia Watson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDmyL6CuzBU) herself.
