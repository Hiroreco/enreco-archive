Elizabeth’s thoughts echoed with the words that had defined her existence: "You were brought here to serve the king". Since her summoning, that belief had been her unwavering guide.Yet, over the past days, she had found other reasons to walk her path—people she cared about, those she wanted to protect, and someone she held dear, longing to be by their side. So, when that light dimmed, an emptiness overtook her. The breaking point came on the fourth day when Nerissa, someone she cherished, told her, "I hate you". Those three words shattered her.

This moment of heartache might have spiraled into a prolonged reflection on her part, but it was quickly derailed—by none other than Nerissa herself. (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Bloodraven](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

Shaking off her melancholy with surprising speed, Elizabeth braced herself for the day ahead. Attempts to dive back into monologues were thwarted at every turn, so she gave up [entirely](https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?feature=shared\&t=1381). Her focus shifted when Mococo, surrounded by accusations of criminality from the previous day’s lottery fiasco, reached out to her. Ever loyal, Elizabeth promised to protect her. Together with Fuwawa, she set out to build a temporary hideout for Mococo, though the structure’s design unintentionally leaned more toward a prison—or perhaps even a grave.

Later, Elizabeth seized a rare quiet moment to resume her internal musings. She pondered the Scarlet Wand’s growing power and found herself oddly stirred by words like "harbinger" and, most notably, "justice". But, as was becoming routine, her thoughts were abruptly interrupted—this time by her noisy neighbor [blasting music](https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?feature=shared\&t=4393).

Elizabeth’s day took a more adventurous turn when she joined Shiori, Nerissa, and the two doggos on a journey to the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*. The party triumphed and recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?feature=shared\&t=5881) of *Amelia Watson*.

As the day wound down, Elizabeth continued working on the prison-slash-dungeon-slash-bunker-slash-grave structure. She also enjoyed a lighthearted chat with Jyonathan—now recalling that they were Amelia—about building an onsen and how Tam’s statue resembled a worm. Their similar sense of humor hinted at a shared [wavelength](https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?feature=shared\&t=12113).
