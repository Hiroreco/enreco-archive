Jyonathan wanted to create something of her own. After seeing all the impressive constructions her friends had built, she felt the urge to contribute to the kingdom’s growing infrastructure. She decided on a bathhouse—an [onsen](https://www.youtube.com/live/uyOxBS0Cx8E?feature=shared&t=257)—believing that none of the heroes had taken a proper shower since arriving in the kingdom and, frankly, they stank. So, she put off tackling the last dungeon until the following day.

Before she could get started, however, she ran into the Hot Pink One, who, as always, immediately switched into flirt mode. It seemed she was still adamant about maintaining her position as Jyonathan’s backup plan (see: [Hot Pink One-Jyonathan: My Chicken Farm](#edge:ame-irys)).

Right after, Elizabeth stopped by, and the two Jade Sword members decided to take a tour around the kingdom together. They visited the dungeon/prison Elizabeth was building, the gigantic statue of Tam Gandr under construction by Gonathon, and chatted about recent events, helping Jyonathan catch up on kingdom drama—such as Mococo’s lottery fiasco.

After bidding Elizabeth farewell, it was finally time for Jyonathan to focus on her onsen project—never mind, she went to the casino to gamble instead. It seemed like the blonde was very easily distracted. She spent quite a bit of time there and lost a lot of money, but she wasn’t too worried; after all, her husband’s pockets were deep, and she could have asked for an [allowance](https://www.youtube.com/live/uyOxBS0Cx8E?feature=shared&t=4140).

Okay, for real this time, Jyonathan got back on track and began construction on the onsen. She envisioned it as a place where everyone could gather and unwind after a long day of work—and, most importantly, a place where they could finally bathe.

After hours of effort, she finally completed something that matched what she had imagined.

The onsen’s atmosphere was warm and inviting, its wooden architecture bathed in the soft glow of dimly lit sea lanterns, giving it a cozy feel. Lush bushes of various kinds surrounded the exterior, creating a natural aesthetic. Upon entering, visitors would first see a reception table, welcoming them in. To the left sat the hot spring itself, its walls built of mossy cobblestone, holding a small stream of steaming water. A sakura tree stood gracefully by its side, adding a touch of tranquility to the setting. It was a breathtaking place, and frankly, it was surprising how Jyonathan managed to design and build it all in such a short amount of time.

With its completion, the onsen joined the list of notable constructions built by the heroes.
