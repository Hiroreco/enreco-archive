Bumping into Fauna and the day’s lottery winner, Mococo, Shiori overheard their lively conversation about money and winnings. Initially intrigued, she considered joining in, but her interest quickly [waned](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=443). Shiori craved a peaceful life—free from economic worries, epic adventures, or romantic entanglements. Her simple, happy existence had always been the goal. The complicated relationships and headaches, like her multiple-wives situation, had been thrust upon her, not chosen.

Later in the day, Shiori joined the others to prepare for the final dungeon. Bijou, wife number one, proposed that Nerissa, wife number two, partner with Shiori for the dungeon, calling it Nerissa’s "turn." Shiori, feeling like an ["Xbox"](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=1972) being passed around, agreed.

Before diving into the _Ancient Sewer Dungeon_, Shiori toured Raora’s newly built [castle](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=2112). The castle’s grandeur provided a brief respite before she grouped up with Nerissa, Fuwawa, Mococo, and Elizabeth to complete the dungeon. Their efforts resulted in recovering _Amelia Watson’s_ [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=5872).

Afterward, Shiori received an urgent call from Gonathon, alerting her that Bijou might be claimed as a "side chick" by the Hot Pink One. Not only was Shiori's response to the situation surprising, but the maiden also took the opportunity to torment the poor knight (see [Shiori-Gonathon: For My Collection](#edge:gigi-shiori)).

On a phone call with Bijou, Shiori entertained the idea of adding IRyS as her own side chick, creating a potential three-way relationship (see [Shiori-Hot Pink One: Side Chick No.3](#edge:shiori-irys)). Reflecting on the chaos of her romantic entanglements, Shiori resolved to stop being passive. If she was destined to navigate webs of relationships, she might as well take control. Her plan? To establish a _"Happy Sugar Life"_ by creating a harem, finally earning the peace she longed for.

With newfound determination, Shiori sought to expand her romantic circle. Taking advice from the voices in her head, she first approached [Mococo](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=8479), but her proposition was swiftly rejected. She tried [Fuwawa](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared&t=8620) next, with similar results. When "chat" suggested contacting Elizabeth, Shiori declined, explaining she wasn’t particularly interested in moms.

With her harem plan in motion, Shiori had turned her chaotic love life into a carefully managed harmony. While it wasn’t the quiet, humble existence she initially sought, it was a version of peace she could embrace. Together with her wives and side chicks, Shiori embarked on her "Happy Sugar Life," ready to face whatever came her way.
