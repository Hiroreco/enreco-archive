The Hot Pink One began her fifth day feeling, well, hot and pink. After some time away, she returned to the kingdom eager to catch up—or so she thought. Something felt missing in her life. Wealth wasn’t the issue, and while adventures were entertaining, they weren’t fulfilling her deepest desires. It wasn’t until she reflected on her eternal consort, Nino Ina, that the answer hit her: why stop at one wife? If one brought so much joy, surely multiplying that joy by acquiring more wives was the solution!

With a newfound clarity, she set her sights on expanding her royal entourage of love.

Before tackling her new goal, the Hot Pink One needed to reconnect with the kingdom’s residents. She visited Gonathon, offering her commentary on the queen’s statue construction. She praised its height while teasingly emphasizing its flatness.

She later joined forces with Gonathon, Raora, Bijou, and Cecilia on a quest to the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*. Together, they succeeded in recovering the lost memories of [Amelia Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/gtOGWDKwQfY?feature=shared&t=2173).

As the group returned to the kingdom, Cecilia, Bijou's newly appointed knight, prepared to call it a day. Seizing the moment, the Hot Pink One attempted to woo the gem princess to her side. Suggesting that Bijou would be safer as her knight instead, she poked at Cecilia’s pride. Unwilling to back down, the Green Knight challenged the Hot Pink One to a duel. Confident in her undefeated streak, the Hot Pink One emerged victorious once more.

Thus, Koseki Bijou became her second wife—or, as the Hot Pink One preferred, Side Chick No.2 (see [Hot Pink One-Bijou: Side Chick No.2](#edge:bijou-irys))

Not content with just two wives, the Hot Pink One continued her quest. Bijou, now wedded to Shiori, unexpectedly offered her wife to the Hot Pink One for reasons that remain unclear. The offer was accepted, and Shiori became Side Chick No. 3. (see [Hot Pink One-Shiori: Side Chick No.3](#edge:shiori-irys))

Her ambitions didn’t stop there. In a bold (and obviously doomed) attempt, she even tried to woo Bijou’s mother. While the proposal didn’t pan out, it led to a humorous exchange about the Tam Gandr statue.

The Hot Pink One’s day of romantic conquests continued as she added Nerissa to her growing entourage as Side Chick No.4 (see [Hot Pink One-Nerissa: Side Chick No.4](#edge:irys-nerissa)). With three new wives acquired, the pink lady, along with her newlyweds, gathered a side chick meetup at Shiori’s house, solidifying her dominance as the ultimate gatherer of love.

Later, the Hot Pink One questioned Nerissa about allegations that FaunaMart was a scam. Nerissa defended the business, explaining that all funds were directed toward building a library. The Hot Pink One remained skeptical—after all, she was clever and not easily swayed. That was until Nerissa mentioned the inclusion of BL books in the library’s collection.

The Hot Pink One ended her day with a series of lighthearted interactions. She attempted (and failed) to learn to fly but felt a deep satisfaction nonetheless. Surrounded by her newly expanded circle of side chicks, she believed she could achieve anything, boasting with pride to those who weren't of the same caliber as her (see [Hot Pink One-Jyonathan: My Chicken Farm](#edge:ame-irys)).
