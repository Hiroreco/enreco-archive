<!-- status: Alive -->

With the heroes having successfully quelled the commotion at the Ancient Sewer Dungeon, the King of Libestal felt a sense of relief and pride in their accomplishments. However, despite this victory, a lingering unease gnawed at him.

Since the earthquake from the previous day, no further reports of unusual disturbances had surfaced within the kingdom—except for one troubling trend: the increasing number of Stains. The land was peaceful, but too peaceful, as if something sinister was lurking just beyond sight.

Deeming this eerie stillness the calm before the storm, the King asked the heroes once more, urging them to prepare—to hone their skills, strengthen their arms, and fortify their spirits. Whatever lay ahead, it would demand everything they had, and more. The greatest danger was yet to come.
