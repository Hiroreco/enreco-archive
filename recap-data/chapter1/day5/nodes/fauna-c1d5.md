Fauna found her business embroiled in an unexpected predicament. After entrusting her store to Nerissa for just one day, she discovered it was now on the brink of a legal battle. This didn’t faze Fauna though—after all, getting sued and encountering trouble was just part of running a business. She didn’t hold Nerissa responsible for the situation, especially since Nerissa somehow had twice as much money as Fauna (a fact that made Fauna question her position as the boss). While Nerissa panicked, Fauna, with the composure of a mafia boss-like CEO, already had a plan.

Fauna had evidence to counter Mococo’s claims. Despite Mococo’s insistence that she had won the previous day’s lottery, Fauna knew there had been no winnings for her. Even so, if Mococo continued to escalate the matter, Fauna had a backup plan: _a coupon_.

The coupon appeared innocent enough, offering a free ticket after purchasing nine, while including [survey questions](https://www.youtube.com/live/iRM_kaxQBp4?feature=shared&t=1965) about customer satisfaction and experience. It even featured a heartfelt "Your satisfaction is of utmost importance!" message to make it feel authentic. However, hidden in the minuscule text at the bottom was a sneaky clause: "Terms and conditions may apply. Redemption of this coupon guarantees the redeemer will not sue FaunaMart in any court of law." It was a calculated move, inspired by other corporations like "Didney," ensuring Mococo would lose her ability to pursue legal action if she used the coupon.

Confident in her strategy, Fauna shifted her focus back to the kingdom’s matters. She learned about the _"Potato Salad Inflation"_, a phenomenon that explained why Nerissa—and seemingly everyone else—was making far more money than her. Despite running a business, Fauna realized she was scraping for pennies while others swam in riches. Yet, she pressed on.

Later, Fauna participated in her favorite daily event: the lottery drawing. The winning number of the day was [348](https://www.youtube.com/live/iRM_kaxQBp4?feature=shared&t=7229), and three winners emerged—Nerissa, Gonathon, and Mococo. This wasn’t surprising, as they had purchased the most tickets. To adapt to inflation, Fauna decided to raise the ticket price from 10 to 100 coins and allowed duplicate numbers to reduce the chances of winning. With these changes in place, she joined Nerissa and Cecilia on a trip to the Volcanic Dungeon, where they recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/iRM_kaxQBp4?feature=shared&t=11306) of Takanashi Kiara.

Towards the day’s end, Fauna decided it was finally time to fulfill her promise to the people: the construction of a library. As she laid the foundation, her biggest fear materialized—_[Mococo](https://www.youtube.com/live/iRM_kaxQBp4?feature=shared&t=14459)_ arrived, furious. She accused Fauna of wrongful business practices, demanded an explanation for her unreceived winnings, and insisted her winnings should not have been split among three winners. Fauna, sticking to her plan, tried to pacify Mococo by offering her the coupon. However, Mococo was unmoved and demanded a 10,000-coin compensation for her suffering.

The commotion escalated as Nerissa, Cecilia, Gigi, and even Mococo’s guardian, Elizabeth (wielding a giant sword), joined the scene. Arguments flew left and right, creating utter chaos. Finding the situation unbearable and recognizing it as an unwinnable battle for the day, Fauna, ever the responsible CEO, made a strategic decision—to [sneak away](https://www.youtube.com/live/iRM_kaxQBp4?feature=shared&t=15771). She left the others to handle the mess and went to sleep peacefully, deciding it would be someone else’s problem tomorrow.
