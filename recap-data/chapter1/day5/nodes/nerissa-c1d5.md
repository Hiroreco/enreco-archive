Nerissa entered her fifth day still reeling from the chaos of day four—the unresolved Mococo lottery debacle loomed over her. While FaunaMart faced the brunt of the lawsuit threat, Nerissa remained unbothered by financial concerns, given her substantial fortune of _55,815 coins_. The source of her wealth remained a mystery, though the smell of potato salad seemed to accompany her wherever she went.

Turning to Cecilia for legal advice, Nerissa recounted the details of the Mococo fiasco. Cecilia provided guidance on how to present her case in court.

However, their discussion was cut short by work duties. As FaunaMart employees, they were tasked with gathering leather for the library’s bookshelves. At the same time, Nerissa accompanied Fauna and Mumei to the Volcanic Dungeon to lend her support. Following their dungeon expedition, Nerissa indulged in some more gambling, [losing 500 coins](https://www.youtube.com/live/iy0fMrzhwOY?feature=shared&t=6495)—an insignificant dent in her wealth of over 50,000 coins.

Mococo finally arrived, and Nerissa braced herself for the climax of the lottery drama. After numerous attempts and headaches, the two managed to resolve their differences. Mococo dropped her lawsuit, putting an end to the ordeal (see [Nerissa-Mococo: A Resolution](#edge:mococo-nerissa)).

With one major issue resolved, Nerissa turned her attention to another: her misunderstanding with Elizabeth from day four. Determined to make amends, Nerissa prepared herself for a heartfelt apology (see [Nerissa-Elizabeth: Bloodraven](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

Finally free from unresolved conflicts, Nerissa joined forces with Elizabeth, Shiori, Fuwawa, and Mococo to tackle the _Ancient Sewer Dungeon_. Together, the group completed the dungeon, recovering the [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/Lv6_Xl1u_Ss?feature=shared&t=5390) of _Amelia Watson_.

As the day wound down, Nerissa upheld her role as a just and diligent member of the Scarlet Wand. She rescued Fuwawa from an accidental entrapment in the [gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/Lv6_Xl1u_Ss?feature=shared&t=7252), gathered materials for FaunaMart, and addressed lingering concerns about the library scam. Her efforts showcased her dedication to both her duties and her colleagues.

To cap off her eventful day, Nerissa became the Hot Pink One’s side chick (see [Hot Pink One-Nerissa: Side Chick No.4](#edge:irys-nerissa)).
