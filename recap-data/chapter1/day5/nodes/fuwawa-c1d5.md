Fuwawa’s day began with a familiar worry. [*"Is Mococo going to the lottery again?"*](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared\&t=346) she wondered, her concern for her companion growing deeper with each passing day. Though she cared for Mococo, this time, Fuwawa decided to stay on the sidelines, watching the fiasco unfold without stepping in. After all, it wasn’t her battle to fight.

As she contemplated her plans for the day, Fuwawa realized that she lacked a clear goal. Since arriving in the kingdom, she’d simply gone with the flow, completing her tasks dutifully and being the good doggo everyone expected her to be. But now, she craved something of her own—something to give her purpose.

The idea of creating a [garden](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared\&t=1460) began to blossom in her mind. Unlike the grand gallows, bustling businesses, and massive statues others were constructing, Fuwawa wanted a small, peaceful space where she could relax and feel at ease. She turned to Elizabeth for help, and the bread lady eagerly agreed.

The garden project would have to wait though, as there were other pressing matters to attend to. While Fuwawa started preparing for the final dungeon, she had an unsettling visit to the king’s castle. As she left the castle, she heard blood-curdling screams and the sound of a heavy thud, like someone had fallen. The eerie noises left her stunned and utterly baffled, a chilling moment she couldn’t shake off.

She then joined Shiori, Elizabeth, Nerissa, and Mococo on a quest to the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*. Together, they conquered the challenges within and recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared\&t=5921) of *Amelia Watson*. Before this, Fuwawa also acted as a witness to Mococo’s settlement for the lottery situation, observing with discomfort as Mococo negotiated for 10,000 coins and received a barrage of [kisses](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared\&t=3342) in the process.

As if her day wasn’t strange enough, Fuwawa’s clumsiness landed her in yet another predicament—this time, trapped in the gallows. She had to call for help, feeling equal parts embarrassed and grateful when others came to her rescue.

Toward the evening, Fuwawa took things slow, enjoying her usual laid-back routine. She planted crops, completed small tasks, and found herself stumbling upon a peculiar [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared\&t=9526) in the under-construction library. Though the topic left her thoroughly confused, she still managed to help Elizabeth save Nerissa, who (perhaps intentionally) had gotten herself [trapped](https://www.youtube.com/live/FjZ9ettDlNw?feature=shared\&t=10522).
