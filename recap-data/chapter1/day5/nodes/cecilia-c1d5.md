<!-- title: Cecilia Immergreen -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Cecilia, proud knight of the princess of Evergreen, donned the title of the _loyal lord protector_. At face value, she was a symbol of honor and duty. Beneath the surface, however, lay an ulterior motive—one that would shake the foundations of her role as a hero.

Her day began with Nerissa briefing her on the Mococo lottery [situation](https://www.youtube.com/live/2ATTd32AV-Q?feature=shared&t=1085). Armed with her "expert" legal knowledge, Cecilia advised Nerissa on court etiquette: avoid apologies and deny mistakes—no matter the truth. Despite the morally questionable guidance, Cecilia exuded confidence in her approach.

Later, she met Raora in a brief but tense encounter. Raora’s instincts hinted at Cecilia’s hidden motives, making her uneasy, or simply put, the pink cat was starting to doubt Cecilia's allegiance. Cecilia clarified her loyalties, claiming she would only betray Raora if Bijou, Raora’s daughter, turned against her.

Cecilia then joined Nerissa and Fauna for a trek through the Volcanic Dungeon, where they recovered Takanashi Kiara’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/2ATTd32AV-Q?feature=shared&t=4084). With trust seemingly established, Cecilia decided to unveil her secret plan.

She revealed her suspicion of the kingdom's king, theorizing that he was orchestrating the heroes’ missions for his own nefarious purposes. The supposed Stains the heroes were tasked to combat had never been real, and the queen, Tam Gandr, was notably absent from the kingdom. Cecilia’s ultimate goal was to overthrow the king and establish the Scarlet Wand as rulers of the kingdom, under the guise of being the "good guys" (if you ignored their history of questionable deeds).

To achieve her goal, Cecilia detailed an intricate scheme to possess the soul of the princess, Koseki Bijou. Her plan required:

- A gem of the deep sea
- An item beloved by her target
- Red powder of fantasy
- A block of the hardest crystal
- Flora
- An ally

Through an ancient ritual, Cecilia aimed to control Bijou as a puppet, granting her the means to seize power. Despite the ethical implications of her plan, Cecilia’s cheerful demeanor and innocent laugh seemed to mask her true intentions—or at least make them more palatable to her allies.

Before initiating her scheme, Cecilia attended to other matters. Noticing her lack of gear compared to her peers, she resorted to asking others for equipment, avoiding the hard work herself. She also volunteered as Mococo’s lawyer in the lottery debacle (see [Cecilia-Mococo: Better Call Cecilia](#edge:mococo-cecilia)). Despite having occupied about three different roles at this point (a knight, an employee, and a lawyer), Cecilia was still depressingly poor.

Next, she accompanied Bijou to investigate the king. The plan turned chaotic when an attempted assassination ended with Cecilia slipping and falling (see [Cecilia-Bijou: A Failed Coup](#edge:bijou-cecilia)).

Undeterred, Cecilia joined Gonathon, Bijou, Raora, and the Hot Pink One in exploring the _Ancient Sewer Dungeon_. Together, they successfully recovered _Amelia Watson’s_ [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/2ATTd32AV-Q?feature=shared&t=12991).
