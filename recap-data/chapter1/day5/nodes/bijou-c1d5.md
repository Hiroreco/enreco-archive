Bijou, no, *Princess Farmer Koseki Bijou Bloodflame Panthera Evergreen* began her fifth day with a regal sense of pride. As the self-proclaimed princess of the kingdom of Evergreen, she had everything a royal could wish for—a loyal knight, a queen for a mother (also self-proclaimed), and another mom with an undeniably cool name. Her royal life seemed perfect.

The day started on a high note as she visited her mother Raora’s newly built castle. Bijou was ecstatic to find a room specifically designed for her, complete with regal decor fit for a [princess](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared\&t=544).

True to her title, Bijou spent her day engaging in what she deemed "princess-like" behavior, including [stalking](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared\&t=2361) other residents of the kingdom. She also sought to turn her iconic moai statue into a perpetual music player, blasting tunes day and night to annoy her neighbors. To achieve this, she visited FaunaMart to purchase a [jukebox](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared\&t=3164).

Bijou’s royal ambitions then led her down a treacherous path. Alongside her trusted knight, Cecilia, she attempted to overthrow the kingdom’s ruler in a daring coup. While the coup didn’t go as planned, it cemented her reputation as a princess who kept things... interesting (see [Bijou-Cecilia: A Failed Coup](#edge:bijou-cecilia))

Adding to her unconventional day, Bijou found herself entangled in polygamous relationships, extending her royal affections beyond her wives. It was clear that the princess had her priorities uniquely arranged (see [Irys-Bijou: Side Chick No.2](#edge:bijou-irys)).

Despite her detours, Bijou eventually joined forces with the Hot Pink One, Raora, Cecilia, and Gonathon to tackle the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*. The group successfully recovered the [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared\&t=9591) of *Amelia Watson*, adding another chapter to their shared adventures.

Back in the kingdom, Bijou stopped by the newly built FaunaMart *library*, which Nerissa was managing in Fauna’s absence. The library accepted donations of all book genres—from science and fantasy to, intriguingly, [BL and GL titles](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared\&t=12928). As an avid writer of fanfiction, Bijou considered contributing some of her works.

As the day wound down, Bijou noticed Gonathon’s incomplete statue of his queen. Ever the mischievous princess, she couldn’t resist making some "enhancements" to the statue’s design, ensuring her mark on the kingdom would not be forgotten.
