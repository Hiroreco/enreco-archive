Mococo was in deep trouble, and she [knew it](https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared&t=332). To most of the kingdom, she was now a criminal, though she still had a small circle of allies she could trust. It all started on the fourth day when she tried to trick Nerissa into giving her more lottery tickets and, in frustration, chased the raven lady with claws after failing to extort her. Despite the chaos she caused, Mococo somehow convinced herself that she was the victim. She cited the emotional distress of being hunted down as proof.

When the fifth day’s winning lottery number was announced and her prize was split three ways, her frustration boiled over. Fauna’s offer of 8,000 coins to settle the matter wasn’t enough for Mococo, who demanded 10,000 coins instead and decided to hire Cecilia as her lawyer—not the greatest choice, given Cecilia’s ties to FaunaMart (see [Cecilia-Mococo: Better Call Cecilia](#edge:mococo-cecilia)).

The situation quickly spiraled out of control. Nerissa, the cause of Mococo’s suffering (and, conversely, a victim of Mococo’s antics), joined the fray, and the argument heated up. One by one, more people got involved—Gonathon, Raora, Elizabeth, and Bijou—and the scene turned chaotic. Mococo, overwhelmed and faced with threats of being banned from the lottery or dragged to the gallows, couldn’t take it anymore. In a panic, the pink-furred dog fled the scene.

The only solace Mococo could find was with [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared&t=1817). The knight in red, ever protective, built a bunker for her to hide in. For a while, Mococo wandered aimlessly, evading those she believed were hunting her. Eventually, a compromise was reached, with Nerissa (likely too exhausted to argue further) agreeing to a settlement with Mococo (see [Nerissa-Mococo: A Resolution](#edge:mococo-nerissa)).

With her name cleared and the ordeal behind her, Mococo returned to the kingdom’s tasks. She joined Shiori, Fuwawa, Elizabeth, and Nerissa in tackling the _Ancient Sewer Dungeon_, where they successfully recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared&t=5922) of _Amelia Watson_. Later, Shiori approached Mococo with a peculiar request, asking if she’d like to join her "Happy Sugar Life" as a pet. Mococo politely declined, only to have her belly button [insulted](https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared&t=8600) by the eccentric black-and-white lady.

As the day wound down, Mococo reflected on how different things had become. Freed from the shackles of the lottery, she realized that if she wanted more money, she’d have to work for it. With ticket prices now inflated and memories of the fiasco still fresh, she decided to steer clear of the lottery entirely. Glancing at the looming gallows behind FaunaMart—a grim reminder of how close she’d come to disaster—Mococo vowed never to let herself fall into such a mess again.
