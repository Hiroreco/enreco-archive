Raora—or, as she now preferred to be called, Queen Mario, was nearing the completion of her grand castle. This construction marked a significant milestone for her self-proclaimed royalty. She took immense pride in her achievement, having overseen and executed most of the work herself.

Excitedly, she gave a tour of the nearly [finished castle](https://www.youtube.com/live/xT6ChmC6CfU?feature=shared&t=315). Built with mossy stone bricks and wooden materials, it embodied the essence of a medieval fortress. The design included a front entrance and four watchtowers guarding its corners. Inside, the castle was divided into numerous rooms, most of which were still awaiting decoration. Raora, however, already had plans for them—a throne room, storage, and even a prison in the basement meant for the "fake queen," Tam Tender.

One room was an exception. Fully adorned in shades of purple, it was Bijou’s room, featuring a bed made from gleaming materials like diamond and gold.

Raora’s aspirations to be recognized as queen extended beyond titles and symbols. She sought to sway Gonathon, the loyal knight, to her side. Despite her efforts, Gonathon remained resolute, his heart already pledged to his queen. Yet Raora was undeterred. She was determined to win over the kingdom, gain everyone’s trust, and solidify her rule.

With the castle nearing completion, Raora began working on constructing the Amber Coin [logo](https://www.youtube.com/live/xT6ChmC6CfU?feature=shared&t=3389) in her guild’s area. This emblem would serve as a symbol of her reign, reinforcing her claim as the true queen.

Later in the day, Raora teamed up with Gonathon, Cecilia, Bijou, and the Hot Pink One to conquer the _Ancient Sewer Dungeon_. The group succeeded in recovering [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/xT6ChmC6CfU?feature=shared&t=9528) of _Amelia Watson_.

The dungeon’s aftermath then brought an unusual twist—Hot Pink One approached Raora with a bold request: to take Bijou’s hand as her side chick. After a moment of hesitation, Raora agreed, recognizing this as an opportunity to strengthen her position as queen. Her condition? The Hot Pink One must acknowledge Raora as the [true queen](https://www.youtube.com/live/xT6ChmC6CfU?feature=shared&t=11463).
