Gonathon was determined to continue the construction of a statue dedicated to his queen. For him, this statue wasn’t just a project—it was a tribute to the one who held a special place in his heart.

His morning took a rather troublesome turn when he encountered Raora, who boldly proclaimed herself as the true queen, "Queen Mario". Raora boasted about her castle, crown, and followers, but Gonathon was undeterred. With unwavering loyalty, he clashed back, defending his queen’s honor. He reminded Raora that his queen already had all those things: the guild base as her castle, a crown of her own, and most importantly, royal followers like him.

After this exchange, Gonathon made his daily contribution to Fauna’s library, even though Tam had previously warned him it was a scam. During his visit, he noticed something peculiar—the looming gallows beside FaunaMart. Fauna explained its purpose: punishing those who didn’t know how to read. Though her reasoning was questionable (as she claimed it would teach empathy through reading), Gonathon decided not to comment. Perhaps it was for the greater good?

Later, Gonathon joined Bijou, Raora, Cecilia, and the Hot Pink One to tackle the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*—a place rumored to be the final dungeon. Despite his usual knightly demeanor, Gonathon was surprisingly "playful" during this expedition. He spent his time running around trying to drink the dirty water and even managed to trick the others into taking a bath in the murky filth, much to Cecilia’s dismay.

At the end of their journey, the group recovered memories of [Amelia Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/LSGUo-UnXwY?feature=shared\&t=8466). Gonathon was stunned to learn that his wife, his pearl, was none other than a famous detective with a storied history of great achievements.

Pride and happiness filled his heart, but alongside these emotions came a creeping worry. What would happen when Amelia regained her full memories?
