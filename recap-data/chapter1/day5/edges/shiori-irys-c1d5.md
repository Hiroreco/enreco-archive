<!-- title: Sidechick No.3 -->

Shiori was simply minding her own business, not particularly invested in much, and certainly wanting to stay as far away from relationship drama as possible. But fate had other plans.

While going about her day, she received a call from her wife, Bijou—a call that would throw her peaceful existence off course. Bijou suggested that the two of them should become side chicks to the Hot Pink One.

That was certainly one heck of a call to receive from your wedded. But Shiori had anticipated this; after all, she was already informed about the matter by [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/BlDRaNhYZxk?feature=shared\&t=7687).

Yet, to everyone’s surprise—including Bijou’s—Shiori just accepted without much hesitation, as if this were the most mundane request in the world. And just like that, she became the Pink Lady’s third side chick.
