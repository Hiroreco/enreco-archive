Elizabeth thought she'd gained something special—someone special. But it was a trick, a jest, a backstab, a betrayal. The previous day, Elizabeth had believed she'd finally connected with Nerissa, the one person who had been on her mind since the beginning of her journey. But alas, she had been played for a fool.

"I hate you."

Three simple words, yet devastating enough to shatter the scarlet maiden’s heart into pieces. The damage was irreversible, the pain unbearable. The weight of it threatened to crush her entirely. Perhaps it wasn’t meant to be. Perhaps she was destined to be a knight and nothing more—just a servant of duty, bound to her sword, forever alone.

And so, she sank into deep despair, lamenting how tragic and lonely her life would be...

For about a minute.

Before she could spiral any further, Nerissa called her. Her voice immediately shattered Elizabeth’s melodramatic thoughts, and what followed was an uncharacteristically desperate apology. Nerissa blamed Gonathon for forcing her to say those cruel words and begged for forgiveness, her voice wet and snotty with over-the-top whimpering. Elizabeth, hearing such pitiful pleading, had no choice but to forgive her. After all, as a knight, she had the duty to forgive and forget (or so she told herself).

The emotional whiplash was so extreme that Elizabeth couldn't think straight for a good while. One moment she was wallowing in despair, and the next she was right back where she started—bickering with Nerissa as if nothing had happened.

In fact, their relationship seemed to evolve from that point. Their arguments became even more frequent, resembling the kind of quarrels real couples would have (not that Elizabeth would ever admit that). Nerissa, of course, reveled in this, fully embracing her role as the chaos [gremlin](https://www.youtube.com/live/1_dhGL0K5-k?feature=shared&t=2151) in Elizabeth’s life.

Even when Nerissa genuinely tried to teach Elizabeth useful things—like how to break into closed-off buildings—Elizabeth would still call her a witch. It was practically a reflex at this point. Their constant bickering even led bystanders to mistake them for an actual couple, much to Elizabeth’s horror.

Meanwhile, Nerissa was putting in extra effort to grab Elizabeth’s attention, as if trying to make up for the previous day... or, more likely, just to mess with her. Unlike Elizabeth, Nerissa was completely open about her obsession. She tried sweet-talking and flirting, but when that didn't work, she even went so far as to trap herself on purpose just to bait Elizabeth into "saving" her—like a knight in shining armor rescuing a lost princess.

Nerissa knew she was getting on Elizabeth’s nerves, and she enjoyed every second of it.
