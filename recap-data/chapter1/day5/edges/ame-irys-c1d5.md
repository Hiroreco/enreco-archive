<!-- title: My Chicken Farm -->

As she stumbled upon Jyonathan, the Hot Pink One wasted no time in boasting about the many sidechicks she had acquired. It was almost as if she was flexing on Jyonathan—sending a silent message that read: "You didn’t fall for me early on? Well, look at me now, surrounded by wives. And soon enough, you’ll be mine too". The pink one felt powerful.

However, Jyonathan—along with Elizabeth, who was also present—had absolutely no idea what she was talking about. Sidechicks? Did she have a chicken farm? If so, where was this chicken farm?

The Hot Pink One found herself struggling to explain the term without just straight-up admitting that she had, in fact, gathered a harem of wives.

Eventually, deciding she was done with the conversation, she ended it by [spitting](https://www.youtube.com/live/gtOGWDKwQfY?feature=shared\&t=7943) on them. Cause why not?
