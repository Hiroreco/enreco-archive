<!-- title: A Resolution -->

Nerissa found herself in quite the predicament—though, to be fair, so did Mococo. The two were at each other's throats, locked in a heated dispute. Nerissa wanted to resolve the whole lottery ticket fiasco in a peaceful manner, as she had been falsely accused in the first place. Meanwhile, Mococo was adamant about receiving compensation, hiring a lawyer, and pursuing a full lawsuit against FaunaMart.

To support her case, Nerissa rallied her guildmates—Fauna, her CEO; Cecilia, her sharp-minded green-haired ally; and Gonathon, a knight she could trust—along with an abundance of evidence proving her innocence.

Mococo, on the other hand had Elizabeth. Just Elizabeth.

Technically, Cecilia was also her lawyer, but unbeknownst to Mococo, Cecilia was actually on Nerissa’s side (see [Cecilia-Mococo: Better Call Cecilia](#edge:mococo-abyssguard-cecilia-immergreen-top-2-left-2)). Fuwawa was also present, but she wanted nothing to do with the whole mess. With things stacked against her, it seemed Mococo had quite the uphill battle ahead.

Nerissa presented her side first, explaining how she had mistakenly miscalculated Mococo's lottery ticket count but had promptly corrected the error. She wasn't asking for anything—she simply wanted Mococo to drop the lawsuit and move on. But instead, Mococo, allegedly, put a 50000 coin bounty on her head.

Mococo, however, was not willing to back down.

The doggo accused FaunaMart of engaging in improper business practices, claiming she had been scammed out of her lottery winnings, shortchanged on her rightful prize money, and—most damning of all—hunted down on orders from a FaunaMart employee, causing her immense emotional distress. As compensation, she demanded [*10,000 coins*](https://www.youtube.com/live/wINOVotsvPY?feature=shared\&t=1310).

The dispute grew more intense, with neither side willing to concede.

At one point, someone suggested sending Mococo to the gallows for her so-called crimes, which—unsurprisingly—sent the poor pup into a full-blown panic. Overwhelmed with fear, she immediately fled, crying out in distress.

By this point, Nerissa was exhausted, mentally. She just wanted this entire ordeal to be over. Determined to put an end to the chaos, she chased after Mococo, tirelessly trying to negotiate a settlement. After what felt like an eternity, the dog finally ran out of energy and had no choice but to listen.

In the end, Nerissa reluctantly agreed to pay Mococo the 10,000 coins. Mococo then added free kisses as part of the deal. Nerissa complied and gave her what she wanted. And with that, the great FaunaMart lawsuit was officially settled. Enemies turned back into friends once more. Yay.
