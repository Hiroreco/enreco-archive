<!-- title: Better Call Cecilia -->

Cecilia didn’t have much money. To put it bluntly, she was pretty poor—not because of some tragic backstory or a traumatic experience that left her penniless, but simply because she refused to do any quests and instead relied on leeching off others.

So when she heard that Mococo needed legal help—or more specifically, _a lawyer_—for her lawsuit against FaunaMart, Cecilia’s eyes sparkled. This was an opportunity she couldn’t afford to miss. Not only could she potentially earn a paycheck from helping Mococo, but she would also be assisting her guildmate’s business in getting out of trouble. Killing two birds with one stone. Easy cash.

Upon meeting her client, Mococo immediately asked if Cecilia had any legal qualifications. Unsurprisingly, she didn’t. But in her defense, she had taken a bar exam before. (The keyword here being "taken," not "passed"). Nonetheless, Mococo didn’t have much of a choice, so she accepted Cecilia as her lawyer anyway.

Mococo wanted 10,000 coins in compensation for her suffering, but Fauna was only willing to offer 8,000. Cecilia advised Mococo to take the 8,000, claiming that she could always ask for more later—like an investment. (Not exactly sure how that worked, but okay.) But Mococo refused to settle, convinced that 10,000 was barely enough to compensate for her suffering.

Fauna then made a different offer, giving Mococo a discount on lottery tickets, essentially making her a privileged customer, along with a "buy 9, get 1 free" coupon. Cecilia, once again, told Mococo it was a good deal. While it might have been questionable for a lawyer to keep agreeing to every offer made by the opposing side, Cecilia was secretly on Fauna’s side, so it made sense. Mococo, however, wasn’t interested in any of it and remained adamant about receiving the full 10,000.

Then Nerissa arrived, claiming she had evidence that Mococo had committed fraud and had framed her by placing a bounty on her head. The pressure was mounting, but Cecilia remained confident and undeterred. She consulted with Mococo, discussed matters with Fauna, and ultimately decided that the only way forward was to take this to the [high court](https://www.youtube.com/live/2ATTd32AV-Q?feature=shared&t=8270).

But things only got worse from there. With Gonathon and Nerissa relentlessly pressing on the case—especially Gonathon, who kept rubbing in Cecilia’s complete lack of legal qualifications—the situation was quickly turning against them. With pressure coming from all sides, the doggo finally broke, running away in tears, leaving her lawyer behind to desperately argue that she was actually fit to be a lawyer.

Later on, the case somehow resolved itself—without Cecilia’s involvement.

Yay! Happy news! So… where’s my paycheck?

Despite not actually doing anything to resolve the case, Cecilia still wanted her cut. She asked for 5% of the compensation as payment for all the hard work she had put into defending Mococo. And Mococo, being ever so generous and understanding, gave her 1.8% instead—which, all things considered, was fair.

Hey, money is money. Cecilia was happy with it. Her first client, her first case (probably her last), and in the end, a successful outcome.
