<!-- title: Side Chick No.2 -->

In her quest to build a harem, the Hot Pink One’s first target was none other than Koseki Bijou. To be fair, it was Bijou who had planted this idea in the pink lady’s head in the first place. Earlier in the day, the gem princess had started making moves on the Hot Pink One—teasing her, dropping hints—fully aware that she was already married to Ina, yet unable to resist stirring up trouble.

The Pink One, taking this as a challenge, wasn’t about to let it slide. Seeing an easy target, she wasted no time in making her own [suggestive advances](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared\&t=11183)—flirting, shaking her hips, anything to lure Bijou to her side. She even went so far as to challenge Cecilia, Bijou’s knight, to a [duel](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared\&t=11365) in order to prove her worthiness as a suitor. And to many people’s shock… she actually won.

Despite this, Bijou still felt a twinge of guilt. After all, she was already bound in matrimony with Shiori. But after talking things out with her wife, a brilliant idea emerged—rather than choosing between them, why not let the Hot Pink One take both her and Shiori as [sidechicks](https://www.youtube.com/live/5o4TerH2bVI?feature=shared\&t=11654)?

Naturally, the Pink One had zero objections to this arrangement. And so, she proposed.

With that, Bijou became the Pink One’s second bride.
