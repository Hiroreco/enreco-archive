<!-- title: Side Chick No.4 -->

Hot Pink One: "I'm so hot, I have three side chicks."

Nerissa: "Can I be your fourth?"

Hot Pink One: "Sure."

And just like that, Nerissa became the Pink Lady's fourth concubine. Honestly, it couldn't have been any simpler.

Remember back on Day Two when Tam asked the Hot Pink One if she was a gold digger? At the time, the pink lady had been literally digging for gold in the mines and didn’t quite grasp what Tam was implying. Fast forward to now, and the moment she secured the richest person in the kingdom as one of her side chicks, the first thing she did was immediately ask for a cut of her [wealth](https://www.youtube.com/live/gtOGWDKwQfY?feature=shared\&t=4779).

Guess Tam had seen right through her from the start.

Nerissa, understandably, declined the request. But that didn’t change the fact that the Pink Lady was now surrounded by four women, making quite the legendary name for herself in the kingdom.
