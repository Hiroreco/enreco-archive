<!-- title: Friends from Business -->

Despite belonging to rival businesses, Cecilia and Nanamoo got along surprisingly well—you could even say they were friends. Not only was Cecilia NanaEleven's [first customer](https://www.youtube.com/live/zPJ78C7uNq8?feature=shared&t=603), but she also spent most of the day by Nanamoo’s side—hanging out, playing games, getting mad at those same games, and everything in between.

Nanamoo’s random [remarks](https://www.youtube.com/live/zPJ78C7uNq8?feature=shared&t=6901) at the most unexpected times often made Cecilia question whether the girl was normal (she was leaning more toward not). But while she found the brown maiden undeniably odd, there was something about that weirdness that she couldn’t help but find... endearing.
