## Day 7: The calm before the storm

A new business opened its doors on this day—a rival store to FaunaMart, known as _NanaEleven_, with NanaMoo as its owner. Right from its grand opening, the store made a name for itself, drawing in a crowd with its unique business ideals and quickly establishing itself as a worthy competitor.

Meanwhile, Nerissa, after being cooked by Kiara the day before, found herself in an unexpected predicament—she had become a ghost. However, during her brief time in the afterlife, she stumbled upon many hidden secrets lurking within the kingdom, further fueling her suspicions of the king. Eventually, she was revived, but the knowledge she had gained in her spectral state left her with more questions than answers.

Two more minigames made their debut on this day. The Scarlet Wand Guild introduced a memory game, while the Cerulean Cup Guild launched a chicken-catching game. Naturally, the games sparked competition among the girls, with NanaMoo taking things very seriously when it came to the memory game.

Then came an unexpected twist. Raora, also known as Queen Mario, had a sudden realization—perhaps the tension she had with Tam wasn’t hatred after all. Maybe, just maybe, Tam was actually in love with her. And so, in a shocking turn of events, Raora proposed to Tam.

Finally, Bijou’s plan to take over the kingdom kicked into full gear—or as she preferred to call it, "spreading the corruption." She spent the entire day becoming an absolute menace to those around her, slowly but surely corrupting others into joining her cause. Among her first recruits? Mococo, who fell to the Stain and embraced the mission alongside her.

With businesses rising, secrets unfolding, rivalries shifting into romance, and corruption spreading, the kingdom stood on the brink of something far greater. The storm was coming.
