_Justice_. Elizabeth’s thoughts had been consumed by that single word ever since her journey began. It lingered in her mind like an unfulfilled promise, shaping her actions and ideals as a knight. But why did it resonate so deeply? Perhaps it was her duty to uphold justice, to shield the kingdom from evil. Or perhaps it was something more personal—a connection she had yet to fully understand. Regardless of the reason, Elizabeth resolved to honor her purpose by serving the king and protecting the people, even as the shadow of impending doom loomed large.

The seventh day, the final day before disaster struck, began with unease. Elizabeth awoke feeling unrested, burdened by a restless night haunted by thoughts of Nerissa. Despite their quarrelsome interactions, Elizabeth felt an inexplicable connection to the raven-haired woman, whom she had previously accused of witchcraft. Nerissa's death weighed heavily on her, yet hope lingered—magic existed in the kingdom, and perhaps there was a way to bring her back.

Determined to prepare for the storm that the king had ominously foretold, Elizabeth ventured out early. The kingdom was quiet, its inhabitants still stirring from sleep, giving her the solitude to reflect and steel herself for what was to come.

As she wandered the kingdom, Elizabeth came across the massive Tam Gandr statue completed by Gonathon. Though her disdain for the blue "queen" Tam Gandr had not waned, she admired the craftsmanship and the loyalty it represented. Despite her lingering spite, Elizabeth couldn’t deny the respect she held for Gonathon's dedication to [his queen](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=958).

Spotting a few early risers, Elizabeth decided to add some liveliness to her day by pranking Cecilia. However, her plans backfired when Cecilia turned the tables on her, catching Elizabeth off guard (this wasn’t the first time one of her pranks had failed).

Elizabeth then joined Cecilia at the newly opened memory game hosted by the Scarlet Wand guild. Unsurprisingly, Elizabeth, more skilled with a sword than strategy games, lost to Cecilia. Yet, during their time together, Elizabeth found herself inexplicably drawn to the green maiden. Something in Cecilia’s eyes—honor, loyalty, and faithfulness—spoke to Elizabeth, as if they shared a deeper connection from another life. Trusting her instincts, Elizabeth formed a positive impression of her newfound [companion](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=1784).

Preparing for the looming storm required resources, and Elizabeth was woefully short on funds. With no other choice, she turned to the kingdom's most peculiar money-making strategy: mass-producing potato salad. Though skeptical at first, she soon found the method to be wildly profitable, earning more than she had since arriving in the [kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=3511).

Between making potato salad and working on her dungeon, Elizabeth found herself in a witty exchange with Frieda—still known by that name at the time, before becoming Nanamoo. The two bantered as Elizabeth teased Frieda about the strange messages she had been sending throughout the kingdom. The playful exchange took a turn when Frieda startled Elizabeth by seemingly reading her thoughts, leaving Elizabeth convinced that Frieda, too, must be a witch.

Their banter continued briefly before Elizabeth returned to her tasks. She took up an unusual hobby: building a small chicken coop and raising [chickens](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=4713). Though it seemed an odd pastime for a knight, Elizabeth approached it with surprising passion. She spoke to the chickens as if they were beloved pets and grew visibly excited whenever one laid an egg (perhaps a little too excited).

Later, Elizabeth had another brief interaction with Cecilia and Frieda, with the latter continuing to tease her about being a [distraction](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gw0dZbPKTG4?feature=shared&t=7509).

Finally, Elizabeth called it a day. The calm before the storm hung heavy in the air, marking perhaps the most peaceful day she had experienced in some time. Yet she knew she must not lower her guard. The red knight had to be ready for the oncoming calamity.
