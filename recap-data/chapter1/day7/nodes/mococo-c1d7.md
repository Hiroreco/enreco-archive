Now free of her past crimes, Mococo felt a newfound sense of liberation. No longer did she have to worry about being chased on horseback or threatened with the gallows. Life was great—though she was officially banned from FaunaMart.

Early in the day, Mococo crossed paths with her (not so) trusty lawyer, Cecilia, who had defended her during the infamous lottery shenanigans a day or two ago. Truth be told, Mococo wasn’t entirely convinced of Cecilia’s competence. The green-haired, self-proclaimed lawyer boasted a supposed 99.8% success rate in court, but her examples often seemed like improvised nonsense. Her credibility wasn’t helped by the fact that she’d threatened Mococo with a sword. All in all, the experience was a solid 3/10.

Later, Mococo decided to check out NanaEleven, the newly opened rival to FaunaMart. Initially skeptical, given her less-than-stellar history with convenience stores, her doubts melted away upon discovering the superior services NanaEleven offered. The prices were reasonable (everything was free), and the lottery system was refreshingly fair, with a guaranteed win rate of 100%. This time, Mococo kept her cool and purchased only [five lottery tickets](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=6668).

However, her patience wore thin while waiting for the winning [announcements](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=7640), as the crowd’s attention kept shifting to Gonathon’s peculiar pregnancy situation. Despite the delay, Mococo eventually claimed her prize: 500 coins. Overall, an 8/10 experience—less waiting time would’ve been ideal, but the thought of NanaEleven eclipsing FaunaMart was deeply amusing.

Determined to prepare for the final day, Mococo spent much of her time gathering materials and earning money by mass-producing potato salads. Her efforts paid off, and with over 10,000 coins in her pocket, she headed to the casino to test her luck. After a series of losses, her persistence paid off with a big win, leaving her triumphant.

Her jolly day would only last for so long. Later in the day, Mococo received a panicked call from Fuwawa. The fluffy one’s beloved chickens had [vanished](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=11111), leaving her distressed and inconsolable. Seeing her companion in such a state, Mococo grew concerned and resolved to investigate. Her first theory? [FaunaMart](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=11362). She speculated, with little evidence, that they might have kidnapped the chickens to turn them into lottery tickets. A ridiculous notion, perhaps, but worth considering.

As the mystery deepened, Mococo stumbled upon the answer herself. While wandering near the Cerulean Cup, her curiosity led her to a dark, ominous corner of the area. The ground was scorched, littered with withered bushes, strange Stains, and patches of fire. Unwittingly, Mococo stepped on one of the rotten blocks, [injuring herself](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=12650). Gonathon, who happened to be nearby, swiftly pulled her out of harm’s way and urged her to cleanse herself in the queen’s holy water to rid herself of corruption. Whether Gonathon was bluffing or not, the fear Mococo felt in that place was all too real.

Shortly after, Bijou appeared. The gem maiden said nothing, merely handing Mococo a peculiar purple hat shaped like a Stain. Unaware of its true nature, Mococo thought it was just an accessory and put it on. But almost immediately, she felt strange. A sinister voice whispered into her mind, commanding her with chilling simplicity: _"The chickens are tasty."_

What happened next was a blur.

When Mococo regained [her senses](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=13135), it felt as though she’d just woken from a deep sleep. She couldn’t recall why there was a hat in her inventory or why her claws were bloodstained. When Fuwawa tearfully confronted her about the missing chickens, Mococo had [no answers](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=13238).

The situation escalated when Bijou cornered Fuwawa. Mococo instinctively stepped in to [protect](https://www.youtube.com/live/qFnAgJtQtiY?feature=shared&t=14838) her fluffy counterpart, distracting Bijou long enough for Fuwawa to escape. Their plan worked, and the two managed to flee.

To ensure their safety, Mococo built a small shelter for the two of them to hide in, preparing for whatever danger lay ahead.
