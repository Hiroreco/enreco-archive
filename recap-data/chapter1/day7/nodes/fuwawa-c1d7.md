Fuwawa had been diligently preparing for the final day, as she always had since the beginning. Her dependable nature had never wavered—she did what needed to be done, avoided causing trouble, and won the hearts of everyone she met. She was, in many ways, the ideal hero, in contrast to her pink counterpart, who was often a source of chaos. Still, Mococo’s antics had their own charm, and Fuwawa couldn’t deny that her partner was a good doggo at heart.

While gathering materials, Fuwawa took a moment to reflect on the kingdom of Libestal. Despite the occasional need to slay enemies and the myriad shenanigans other heroes engaged in, the kingdom seemed [peaceful](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=2085) overall. The challenges they faced often felt more like lighthearted adventures than real threats.

She spent some time exploring the kingdom, admiring its latest developments, including the newly opened _NanaEleven_ and the completed statue of the [queen](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=2133). Fuwawa marveled at the accomplishments of her fellow heroes.

With plenty of time before the final day arrived, Fuwawa turned to a newfound passion: caring for Elizabeth’s chickens. As mentioned on day six, Fuwawa had been seeking something to nurture, and these chickens were the perfect companions. She adored their cuteness and tended to them lovingly in her small coop. Her eyes sparkled with joy whenever they laid eggs, and she fed them every seed she could find. It was a simple yet blissful routine that brought her immense happiness.

However, her joy was short-lived. After venturing out to gather materials, Fuwawa returned to find her coop empty. All the chickens were gone—vanished without a trace. Not even a feather remained. Confusion and panic set in as she considered the possibilities. Had they flown away? Escaped? Both seemed unlikely. This left her with a more troubling thought: someone had _done_ something to them.

Her mind turned to Mococo; the fuzzy one's recent string of questionable actions made her a suspect. But with no evidence, Fuwawa couldn’t be sure. Saddened by the loss, she let out a heart-wrenching bau bau that could tug at anyone’s heartstrings.

Fuwawa reported the incident to [Gonathon and Raora](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=11569). Overcome with sadness and frustration, she [lashed out](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=11633) at Raora, suspecting the big cat of having eaten all the chickens. This outburst was uncharacteristic of Fuwawa, who was typically gentle and composed. However, Raora assured her that she wasn’t responsible and, to help ease her sorrow, gifted her some chicken eggs to start anew. Grateful, Fuwawa accepted the eggs and began hatching a new brood.

Feeling somewhat better, Fuwawa returned to her preparations. A brief moment of levity came when Mococo, having won big at the casino, celebrated so enthusiastically that her cheers echoed throughout the kingdom, reaching Fuwawa’s ears.

But her relief didn’t last long. Not long after, Fuwawa discovered her chickens missing [once again](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=13177). Something was definitely amiss. Seeking answers, she approached [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/zdQoGFICNDk?feature=shared&t=13459), who revealed that he had a suspicion about the culprit. Someone corrupted was targeting her chickens, he warned. He urged Fuwawa to be cautious and to avoid accepting hats from anyone—especially Mococo, who might already be under the influence of corruption.

Fuwawa barely had time to process Gonathon’s warning before she was confronted by Bijou, the source of the spreading corruption. The gem maiden was a terrifying sight, exuding an aura of menace that set off every alarm in Fuwawa’s instincts. Even a single glance at Bijou was enough to send her fleeing in fear.

Fuwawa’s once-peaceful view of Libestal began to crumble. Her chickens were gone, the corruption was spreading, and even her closest companion, Mococo, might not be trustworthy. For the first time, Fuwawa felt a deep, foreboding fear for what awaited on the final day.
