<!-- title: Nerissa Ravencroft -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Nerissa had become a ghost. Slain by Kiara the day before—despite insisting she had done nothing wrong—she now wandered the land as a spirit, a soul without a body. But she wouldn’t remain that way forever. She had a plan. She would take vengeance against Kiara for what the phoenix had taken from her.

But before that, an idea struck her—she could use her ghostly form to explore the kingdom’s cracks and hidden corners, places she couldn’t normally reach. She had long harbored suspicions about the King, and this was her chance to uncover the truth.

She drifted through the kingdom, but nothing seemed too out of place aside from several abandoned buildings. However, once she reached the castle, peculiarities began to reveal themselves. A hidden prison cell. The complete absence of the Jade Sword guild’s symbol on the castle grounds. Warping crystals that led to unknown locations. Blocked paths. It was odd. Some might dismiss these things as simple design choices, but Nerissa thought otherwise—especially when she stumbled upon [cryptic messages](https://www.youtube.com/live/CFSfP27KTco?feature=shared&t=5386) hidden by two of the guards.

Upon decrypting the message, it read, "Land of fated destiny echoed o'er and o'er again. Break the chains and it will flee, back to where it all began." What could it possibly mean?

Whatever it was, Nerissa needed to inform the others. When she reunited with the group, however, she immediately spotted Kiara among them and lunged at her to exact [revenge](https://www.youtube.com/live/CFSfP27KTco?feature=shared&t=5918). But before she could do anything, Gonathon stepped in, stopping the fight. The two oranges then claimed that there was a way to bring Nerissa back to life—by venturing into the Volcanic Dungeon and completing its trials. If successful, the phoenix would bless her with rebirth. Hearing this, Nerissa relented and agreed to let them help her.

Before setting off, she first shared her findings with Gonathon and Mario.

The three of them agreed to keep an eye on these strange discoveries and to remain cautious of the King. With that in mind, Nerissa left with Gonathon and Kiara for the dungeon, where she successfully reclaimed her body and returned to the world of the living.

Upon her return, she came across Koseki Bijou, who was out in the fields. Curious, Nerissa approached to greet her—but Bijou didn’t respond.

Instead, she continued pulling crops from the ground, her movements eerily methodical. No, calling it "harvesting" wouldn’t be right—at this pace, she was outright destroying the fields.

Startled, Nerissa tried to stop her, calling for help. Soon, everyone gathered, watching in shock as Bijou tore through the crops with unrelenting speed. They yelled at her and tried using their Revelations to snap her out of it, but nothing worked. Only when the fields were left barren did she finally stop. And then, in a chilling voice, she uttered just four words: _"May the land starve."_ And with that, she vanished.

So it was Bijou who had been destroying the fields all along. But more importantly—why? What had happened to her? Why had she done such a thing? The group was left shaken and confused. Nerissa, however, was more upset than anything else. Not out of concern for Bijou, but because the crops had been her main source of income, and their destruction meant a massive hit to her profits. Still grumbling under her breath, she replanted everything to prevent a potential famine.

Then she called it a day—a day of unraveling mysteries, of uncovering hidden truths within the kingdom, and perhaps, foreshadowing what was yet to come.
