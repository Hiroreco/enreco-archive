Cecilia began the day with a focused yet questionable plan: she aimed to control the princess and use her as a puppet to rule the kingdom. Though many dismissed her as delusional, they humored her intentions, allowing her to proceed with her schemes. To ensure the success of her plan, Cecilia resolved to strengthen her relationships with others—not out of altruism, but to strategically "leech" their resources and support when needed.

Early on, Cecilia met with Mococo, her client from the prior day’s chaotic lawsuit. Mococo's skepticism about Cecilia’s competency as an attorney was palpable. In an attempt to impress her client, Cecilia exaggerated her past successes, which only served to undermine her credibility further.

Cecilia then encountered Mario, who was equally unconvinced of her abilities, this time in her role as a knight. It seemed skepticism followed her in every role she undertook. Their conversation touched on these doubts, all while they intruded into the Cerulean Cup guild base. The interaction left much unresolved but solidified the doubts surrounding Cecilia's effectiveness in her many ventures.

Later in the day, Cecilia visited FaunaMart and stumbled upon Kiara and Frieda [sneaking around](https://www.youtube.com/live/iAYrdIlfVf0?feature=shared&t=1728) at the convenience store. While Kiara made a quick escape, Frieda panicked under Cecilia’s scrutiny. Their quirky interaction concluded with Frieda introducing Cecilia to her newly launched business, NanaEleven. During this encounter, Cecilia affectionately bestowed Frieda with the nickname "Nanamoo," solidifying their growing camaraderie (see [Cecilia-Nanamoo: Friends From Business](#edge:moom-cecilia)).

Though Cecilia’s motivations for fostering relationships were initially self-serving, she exhibited a surprising level of genuine care for those around her. Beneath her calculated plans lay a good heart and a willingness to help others in need.

This duality was most evident in her interactions with another knight, Gonathon G. Despite their limited encounters, Cecilia felt an unspoken bond with him and went out of her way to offer support during his most difficult of moments (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: Green and Orange](#edge:cecilia-gigi)).
