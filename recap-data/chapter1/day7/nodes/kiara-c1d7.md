Though the journey was meant to culminate in a grand battle on the eighth day, for Kiara, day seven marked her final moments in the enigmatic kingdom of Libestal. Other pressing matters called her away, preventing her from standing alongside her comrades in the climactic fight. The thought saddened the orange maiden, but she resolved to spend her remaining time in the kingdom to the fullest, holding her head high.

Kiara approached her last day with no clear plan, deciding instead to let events unfold naturally. Her first interaction of the day was with Gonathon, a figure she had longed to have by her side but ultimately could not. Gonathon’s heart belonged to another, and Kiara respected his loyalty. As loyal servants to their queen, Tam Gandr, the two found camaraderie in their shared dedication. Together, they had always worked to safeguard the kingdom in their queen’s absence.

Later, Nerissa, whose life Kiara had taken the day before, returned seeking vengeance. However, with Gonathon acting as a mediator, tensions were eased, and a compromise was reached. Kiara, being a phoenix, agreed to assist in Nerissa's [revival](https://www.youtube.com/live/lNIoudshEkQ?feature=shared\&t=4051).

On her return to the kingdom, Kiara received an urgent call from Nerissa. Bijou, the corrupted princess, was wreaking havoc in the kingdom's garden, destroying crops in a chaotic rampage.

Kiara and Nerissa tried to stop her, but their efforts were in vain. Bijou eventually left, leaving the garden in shambles and a heavy sense of loss in her wake.

Later in the day, Kiara stopped by the newly opened NanaEleven convenience store. Despite her complicated history with lotteries and her strained relationship with her former guildmate, Kiara found herself [supporting](https://www.youtube.com/live/lNIoudshEkQ?feature=shared\&t=6907) the store’s lottery system to humor her friend. It was a simple act of goodwill, a gesture that spoke to her forgiving nature.

Kiara also participated in a lighthearted memory game with other heroes and got swept up in an impromptu ["male pregnancy"](https://www.youtube.com/live/lNIoudshEkQ?feature=shared\&t=8231) arc involving rumors of Gonathon’s supposed pregnancy. It was all in good fun, a humorous distraction amidst the weighty events of the day.

As the day drew to a close, it was time for Kiara to bid her farewells. Her time in the kingdom had been nothing short of extraordinary. From saving ~~Lesbians~~ Lebestians (I will run this joke to the ground if I have to) and forming unbreakable bonds to serving queens, exposing lottery scams, recovering long-lost memories of owning a fast-food chain in a fiery dungeon, and engaging in countless shenanigans—including the murder of a raven-haired rival—her journey was as chaotic as it was fulfilling. Each memory, no matter how absurd or poignant, was a treasure she wouldn’t trade for the world.

With a solemn bow before Tam Gandr’s statue, Kiara whispered her goodbyes. The kingdom of Libestal had left its mark on her, as she had on it. For now, her story in this realm had come to an end, but the memories would stay with her forever.
