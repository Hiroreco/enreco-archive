Although Cleopatra/Darwin/Napoleon/Frieda—her name was always a mystery—had been absent in the kingdom for a while, she had been quietly working on something monumental. Before she "started her vlog" on day seven, both Elizabeth and Cecilia noticed her unwavering diligence. She was so focused that she tolerated no distractions (see [Elizabeth's Point of View](#node:liz)).

When the time was right, she launched her vlog with great excitement. It was a pivotal day for the girl in brown, one where she would unveil something that would change her life—and the lives of the kingdom's dwellers—for the better. However, her big announcement was briefly delayed when she stumbled across Kiara, who sought a heartfelt conversation about their bond as Amber Coin members.

Unfortunately, the two were caught snooping around FaunaMart by Cecilia. In typical fashion, the girl in brown threw her guildmate under the bus without hesitation.

With distractions out of the way, it was finally time for her big reveal. She proudly announced her secret project: the grand opening of *NanaEleven*, her very own convenience store.

NanaEleven was established as a rival to FaunaMart, though its stated goal was to "help" the existing store. She explained that FaunaMart’s location wasn’t ideal—it lacked interesting attractions (despite being near a giant statue, a gallows, and a castle). NanaEleven, she claimed, was designed as an outlet mall with ample parking, sure to draw more visitors and spark consumerism.

The store’s grand opening was an immediate success, attracting curious onlookers. NanaEleven explained its offerings:

1. The store sold the juiciest berries and finest meats. Basic items, but here’s the twist—they were all free.
2. Its main attraction was the lottery. Unlike FaunaMart’s luck-based system, NanaEleven’s lottery guaranteed fixed prizes of 100 coins each. The winners? The first 20 customers who purchased tickets! (There were only 19 people in the kingdom).

Despite its seemingly altruistic nature, the lottery tickets contained a hidden element that our shop owner did not disclose.

Speaking of names, the entrepreneur asked Cecilia, her first customer, to give her a fitting title. Cecilia christened her "Nanamoo," a name the owl girl immediately adored for its catchy ring. Thus, Nanamoo was born. The pair unexpectedly bonded over their business dealings, forming an unusual friendship (see [Nanamoo-Cecilia: Friends From Business](#edge:moom-cecilia)).

About an hour after distributing her free lottery tickets, it was time to announce the winners. Unsurprisingly, everyone [won](https://www.youtube.com/live/zPJ78C7uNq8?feature=shared&t=6391). During the celebration, Nanamoo made a cheeky remark about Gonathon looking [pregnant](https://www.youtube.com/live/zPJ78C7uNq8?feature=shared&t=6241), which snowballed into an entire side story (see [Gonathon’s Point of View](#node:gigi)).

Though NanaEleven had just opened, it had already made an impact—albeit with a financial loss of 1,000 coins. Despite the apparent success and charm of Nanamoo’s new venture, there was something hidden behind her cheerful smile. Only time would reveal her true intentions.
