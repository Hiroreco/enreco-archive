Gonathon awoke from a restless night, haunted by troubling thoughts. The corruption spreading through the kingdom weighed heavily on his mind, alongside the impending sense of doom tied to the "calm before the storm." Above all, his Pearl—the one he cherished most—had forgotten him, leaving an ache of loneliness and doubt in his heart.

Yet, despite the emotional turmoil, Gonathon resolved to press on. As a knight entrusted by his queen, he couldn't afford to falter. He steeled himself, determined to complete the grand statue of his queen—a monument of his devotion—before the day ended. But as he set to work, he was interrupted by an unexpected sight: why were there people in his guild base?

He discovered Cecilia and Raora, members of other guilds, poking around in his guild's base. His confusion faded quickly as he stepped outside and was met with an eerie sight. The Moai statue Bijou had built now wept blood, a chilling omen of the [corruption](https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=401) spreading unchecked through the land.

Before he could investigate further, Gonathon focused on [reviving](https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=1019) Nerissa, who had perished the day before and lingered as a ghost. Determined to restore her to life, Gonathon recalled ancient scriptures detailing how Kiara, as a phoenix, could aid in resurrection. So, gathering Nerissa and Kiara, he embarked on a journey to the Volcanic Dungeon once more. Their shared efforts bore fruit, and the raven knight was revived.

During their quest, Gonathon took the opportunity to share his growing concerns about Bijou’s corruption with Nerissa, who promised her assistance in stopping the princess’s plans. But their conversation was overheard by Bijou herself.

Later, while passing by Cecilia and Nanamoo playing a memory game, Gonathon decided to join in for a change of pace. Despite not taking it seriously, he won, much to Cecilia’s chagrin—a small but welcome reprieve from the heavier matters at hand.

Then came an utterly bizarre and unexpected detour: Gonathon, a male knight, was rumored to be [pregnant?](https://www.youtube.com/live/_pxgqfGjshs?feature=shared&t=6299) The absurd idea stemmed from a visit to the newly opened NanaEleven store, where Nanamoo somehow turned a simple errand into a side quest. Despite the silliness, Gonathon found himself drawn into the chaos. He half-heartedly worried over Nanamoo’s grim warnings about male pregnancy survival rates and even agreed to an impromptu "pregnancy test."

Of course, Gonathon wasn’t pregnant, but the sheer absurdity of the situation lightened the mood. He recognized it as a much-needed distraction from the burdens he'd been carrying. Perhaps his friends sensed his struggles and tried to cheer him up—or perhaps they were simply eccentric. One knight, however, showed genuine care, going out of their way to remind Gonathon of his worth and ensure he didn’t feel alone (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: Green and Orange](#edge:cecilia-gigi)).

Yet, the lighthearted moments were fleeting. As Gonathon neared completion of the queen’s statue, he realized he was too late to prevent a grave disaster—Bijou had spread her corruption to Mococo and possibly beyond. Sensing the danger, Gonathon fled the scene.

He penned two letters that night: one to Amelia Watson, warning her of the growing corruption and urging her to investigate the king, whom Gonathon was beginning to doubt. He implored her to trust no one, not even him, as the days ahead would be fraught with uncertainty. The second letter was for his queen, updating her on the kingdom’s state and vowing to protect it in her absence, as her loyal knight.

The final day loomed ominously on the horizon. Despite the mounting dangers, Gonathon knew he had to face whatever came with courage and resolve, for the sake of his kingdom, his queen, and the ones he cared about.
