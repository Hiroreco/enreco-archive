Queen Mario and her trusty knight, Cecilia, began their day as any good royal duo might—by casually trespassing into other people’s homes. This seemingly innocent detour led to a shocking revelation for Mario: Tam Gandr, the so-called "fake queen" she had clashed with since day one, the person who had been her sworn nemesis, was... in love with her?! (See [Mario-Tam Gandr: Enemies to Lovers](#edge:raora-kronii)).

Well, that was quite the way to kick off the day. With only one day left before the kingdom’s reckoning, Mario decided it was time to go all out.

Mario wasted no time and began working on a sign for her proposal when an urgent call from Nerissa interrupted her. Bijou, Mario's own daughter, was wreaking havoc in the kingdom’s garden, destroying it entirely. The news was deeply distressing for Mario. She couldn’t believe her daughter would commit such acts, and her heart ached with worry for Bijou’s well-being. It was a stressful moment that weighed heavily on her.

After the turmoil, the remainder of Mario's day was oddly peaceful. She tried her hand at the newly introduced chicken-catching [minigame](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rd0awHHBTiA?feature=shared&t=6336), explored the recently opened [NanaEleven](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rd0awHHBTiA?feature=shared&t=7390), gathered materials for the looming final day, and spent quality time with her friends. Despite the foreboding sense of impending doom that hung over the kingdom, the atmosphere was surprisingly cheerful, offering Mario a brief reprieve from her worries.
