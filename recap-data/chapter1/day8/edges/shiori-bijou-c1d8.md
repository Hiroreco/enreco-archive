<!-- title: Divorce No.1 -->

Shiori was Bijou’s first wedded partner—the only one where they actually had a proper marriage ceremony, unlike the others. They had shared plenty of lovey-dovey moments, and despite their quirky antics, their relationship had seemed relatively solid.

But after being freed from the control of corruption, Bijou realized just how terrible it was to be chained to and controlled by something—or someone—else. She had no intention of ever experiencing that again. So, she decided she would sever every relationship chain that bound her. And the first step? Divorcing Shiori.

Shiori was stunned. Throughout their entire journey together, she had done nothing wrong. She had simply gone with the flow, chill and understanding as always. And yet, now here was Bijou, tossing her aside like she was some item to be picked up and discarded at will.

So, naturally, Shiori wasn’t about to go down without a fight. Spiteful? Maybe. But deserved? Absolutely.

If Bijou wanted a divorce, fine. But Shiori wasn’t letting her walk away without taking a chunk out of her wallet first. She demanded the most expensive item on the menu at the divorce tavern as compensation, and Bijou—now financially crippled—was forced to pay up.

If that wasn’t enough, Shiori also declared Bijou a deadbeat father for abandoning her and the "child" they had together—leaving Shiori to raise it alone. She was not happy, and honestly, it was understandable.

Still, the breakup was final, and Bijou had two more marriages left to end.
