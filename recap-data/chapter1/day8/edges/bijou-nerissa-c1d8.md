<!-- title: Divorce No.3 -->
<!-- relationship: No Longer Together -->

The final divorce. This time, it was with someone Bijou had beef with during the first few days—Nerissa.

Unlike the others, Nerissa wasn’t all that uppity about the whole side chick polygamy situation. In truth, she had just tagged along because... well, she was Nerissa. So Bijou figured this one would be quick and painless.

And quick and painless it was.

With that, Bijou was finally freed from the shackles of marriage—and she had never felt more alive.
