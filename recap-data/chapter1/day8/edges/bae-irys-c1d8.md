<!-- title: Pure Spite -->

Peasant Da Bae had nothing. Like, literally nothing. Wooden tools. Empty pockets. A hat—which wasn’t even hers but a hand-me-down from someone else. She was, by all definitions, empty-handed. Which made sense, considering she had been absent for 85% of the entire journey.

But worse than the lack of wealth, tools, or influence? She had no deep relationships with anyone. While others were out collecting wives like prized trophies, Bae had zero.

So, when you have nothing while others have everything, what do you do? You annoy them. Out of sheer, unfiltered spite. Most of the kingdom’s folks were relatively nice to her, but there was one exception.

_The Hot Pink One._

Ohhhh, something about that pink lady made Bae’s blood boil. The smugness in her expression, the way she kept referring to Bae as "Peasant." And worst of all? The boasting. This woman had so many wives. And she never shut up about it.

At first, Bae wanted nothing to do with her. But after enduring enough, she decided—no, she vowed—to make this pink menace suffer. For the rest of the day, Bae dedicated herself to being as [annoying](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=3285) as humanly possible. Mocking her in front of others, trying to steal her so-called "eternal consort," and throwing shade at every opportunity. Bae had every right to do so. She had nothing to lose. And every bit of it was delicious.
