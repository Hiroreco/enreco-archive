<!-- title: Oh, She Forgot... -->

This strange owl friend Cecilia had made was… well, strange. But not in a bad way. She had a habit of giggling evilly for no reason, opened up a shop only to give everything away for free, liked pretending she was part of the Scarlet Wand guild (even though she wasn’t), and rambled about how she didn’t have amnesia—claiming instead that she remembered her past life where she was "cool, had tons of friends, and drove a Ferrari." She was an oddball, to say the least. Yet, despite all of that, Cecilia had grown attached to her—like an odd little sister she found herself wanting to protect.

Throughout the last day, Cecilia was always keeping an eye out for [Nanamoo](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=2207). Whether it was checking in on whatever trouble she was getting into, making sure she was up to date on current events, or simply seeing what she was doing—it was a constant. Just the day before, she had frequently asked about how Nanamoo’s business was doing. Unlike many of Cecilia’s other relationships, which she maintained partly for her ulterior motives, this bond was different. This was one she had nurtured, one she had come to genuinely appreciate.

And it was nice. For both of them. A green knight and her silly bird friend.

Even during the final battle against the corrupted King, Cecilia kept looking out for her. And when the dust settled, getting back to where everything began, everyone gathered with their respective guilds to take final commemorative pictures. Though Nanamoo wasn’t technically a member of Scarlet Wand, in Cecilia’s heart, she was.

So, without hesitation, Cecilia called Nanamoo over for the picture.

...Except, the response she received wasn’t what she was expecting.

Instead of an excited answer or a teasing remark, she was met with confused words.

"Who? What? Where?"

At first, Cecilia was taken aback. But then, realization dawned on her.

Nanamoo had forgotten about everything.

The adventures they had shared. The bonds they had built. The time they had spent together.

The moment was brief, and Cecilia didn’t want to spoil the atmosphere for everyone, so she kept quiet about it, maintaining her usual bright demeanor. But deep down, she was hurting. It was an ache she couldn't ignore.

At the very least, this wouldn’t be the last time they interacted. Maybe, in time, Nanamoo would recover her memories. Maybe they could rebuild what was lost.

But still—right now, in this moment—it hurt.
