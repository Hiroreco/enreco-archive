<!-- title: Forever My Consort -->

Ina had one special case for a wife. She wasn’t unfamiliar with the antics of the Hot Pink One. She had seen firsthand how much of a nutcase this woman was—flirting with every girl in sight, collecting wives like trinkets, and basking in her ever-growing harem. Ina didn’t comment much. She had accepted it as just another part of her consort’s chaotic nature.

But what Ina didn’t expect… was just how low this pink menace was willing to go. Even tricking someone who was heartbroken—taking advantage of a vulnerable soul who had already lost so much.

Upon meeting Amelia Watson, the Hot Pink One did the unthinkable. She lied. She tricked the blonde into believing that she was the one who had given her all those diamonds during their first meeting, that she was the one Amelia had been searching for all this time.

Ina, watching this horror unfold before her very eyes, immediately tried to stop her wife. Flirting? Sure. Womanizing? Expected. But this? This was crossing the line. And to make matters worse, as the Pink One tried to brainwash Amelia, she threw out words that stung more than any dagger. How Amelia was "special" to her. Despite the eternal vows she had already sworn to Ina.

Ina couldn’t take it. She left, sad and hurt. But karma came quickly. Her sister, Bijou, had been informed everything, and she was not happy. The moment she found out her sister had been made to cry, Bijou confronted the pink menace. And suddenly, the Hot Pink One backpedaled. The confident womanizer was gone. She frantically declared that Amelia was merely a fling—just a momentary distraction, and begged for Ina’s forgiveness. Ina being the empathetic soul that she was, forgave her silly wife.

Because, despite everything, love is love. And so, the two shared a dinner date at Mori’s tavern, exchanging sweet words over delicious food, as if nothing had ever happened.

Ina, the sweetest, kindest, and most normal person in the entire kingdom, had somehow found a way to put up with the silliest, most unpredictable one. But maybe that’s just how love worked. And despite the minor setback, they walked through their journey hand in hand, sticking together till the [very end](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=9492).
