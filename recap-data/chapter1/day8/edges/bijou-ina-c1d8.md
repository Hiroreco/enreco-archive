<!-- title: Wooden Shovel -->

The corruption was spreading fast, and at the heart of it all, Ina knew exactly who was responsible. Her sister—Koseki Bijou. The Stain Princess. The one behind countless disasters. The mastermind of all this chaos. As Ina had declared the previous day, she would bring her sister down—no matter what.

And so, nearly the entire day was dedicated to that mission. She discovered the cure for the corruption, devised an elaborate plan to deceive the afflicted, and ultimately freed them from their chains of evil. Now, only one obstacle remained—her sister.

Bijou refused to drink the cure. She knew what it would do to her. But with her comrades returning to normal one by one, her power was slipping away. Desperate, she issued a challenge—one final duel. The winner decides the fate of the loser. Ina accepted.

And thus, the battle between the two sisters began.

When the dust settled, Ina stood victorious. And with her victory, she demanded that Bijou drink the cure. The princess tried to run, but deep down, she knew it was futile. She had lost. With no other choice, she relented. Standing atop her Moai statue, with her sister and their mother beside her, Bijou took the cure—freeing herself from the corruption at last.
Ina was overjoyed.
