<!-- title: Divorce No.2 -->

Bijou was on a divorce spree, and the Hot Pink One was her second target. But unlike her first victim, Shiori—who, despite everything, still cost Bijou a bit of money in the process—this one wasn’t going down without a fight.

The Pink One, unwilling to lose her side chick, desperately tried to argue her way out of it. Her reasoning, however, was comically illogical, filled with excuses that made absolutely no sense. But Bijou had already made up her mind.

Defeated but determined to get something out of this, the Pink One demanded a compensation fee of 1,000 coins.

There was just one problem—Bijou had already spent all her money on her previous divorce. So, being the crafty gem she was, she tricked Gonathon into covering the fee, saying it was for this thing called ["Bijou Tax."](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=13948)

And so, with the price [paid](https://www.youtube.com/live/u3MQlnSHfhA?feature=shared&t=14099), Bijou was officially freed from her second chain of marriage. Only one more to go.
