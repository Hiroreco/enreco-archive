<!-- title: Mission Success? -->

Cecilia’s grand plan was finally coming to fruition. It had been on her mind since the very start of the day, and now, with the ritual complete and the corruption subdued, only one step remained. All she had to do was present Princess Koseki Bijou with the (totally not suspicious) cake, have her recite the oath, and just like that—the princess would be hers.

And she succeeded.

At long last, after all her careful scheming, she had the princess under her control. And by extension... the entire kingdom!

Ahahahahahaha!

...Except there was one small problem.

She had finally pulled it off—just as everyone was leaving the kingdom to face the Stain King. And, well... they never came back.

So, yeah. The plan was kind of... for nothing.

But nonetheless! This was only the beginning for the green mastermind. She would surely get what she wanted in due time.
