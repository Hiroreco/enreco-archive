<!-- title: My Money -->

Nerissa would do anything to help her boss. Well… almost anything. She managed the shop, handled advertising, and gathered books for the library—whatever Fauna needed, she was there. But the moment something involved her wealth? That was where she drew the line.

Over the past few days, Nerissa had worked tirelessly, climbing her way to the top and earning her place as the richest person in the kingdom. Not because she needed to spend the money on anything—she simply enjoyed the feeling of having deep pockets. But with great wealth came great problems.

Case in point: the previous day, she had bought a lottery ticket from NanaEleven. And now, the brown shop owner was demanding 50% of her earnings as payment.

To avoid such an unfair predicament, Nerissa devised a clever plan. She would distribute her money among trusted individuals, making it appear as though she didn’t have much left. Once Nanamoo collected her so-called "cut," Nerissa would retrieve her money, and all would be well. A perfect plan.

She turned to the two people she [trusted most](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=4129). Fauna, her boss, received 25,000 coins, while Cecilia got 5,000. And just as planned, when Nanamoo came to collect, she was tricked into believing Nerissa only had a mere 1,000 coins. She walked away with very little. Victory.

But just as Nerissa was about to retrieve her money, something unexpected happened.

Fauna, out of nowhere, decided to buy NanaEleven from Nanamoo—offering up all the money Nerissa had given her.

Nerissa stood there, frozen in disbelief. That was her money. Money she had shed sweat and blood for. And Fauna was about to hand it over to the very person who had just been scamming her?

Before she could even protest, Nanamoo swiftly rejected the offer, much to Nerissa’s relief. But she wasn’t taking any more chances. Before her boss could come up with any more bold ideas, Nerissa immediately stepped in, reclaimed her money, and bolted—laughing at Fauna for the first time at the sheer ridiculousness of the stunt she'd just tried to pull.

She still loved her boss, though, so it was no biggie.
