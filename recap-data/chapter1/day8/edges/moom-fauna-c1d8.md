<!-- title: Deal of the Century -->

FaunaMart had witnessed the rise of NanaEleven, and they were not pleased. A rival store? Worse yet, this rival store was gaining more favor than FaunaMart? Fauna had poured hours of effort, blood, and sweat into her business—collecting materials and building an establishment—only for this tiny shed of a "store" to overshadow her? Unacceptable. She had to do something about it.

After Nerissa temporarily entrusted Fauna with 25,000 coins, telling her she could spend "some of it" if needed, an idea sparked in Fauna's mind. She [summoned](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=920) NanaMoo, the owner of NanaEleven, to the third floor of the library, where she intended to propose what could only be described as the Deal of the Century.

In her best Godfather tone, Fauna addressed the brown entrepreneur, recounting their past, their relationship, and the business conflict now standing between them. NanaMoo listened, but her expression made it clear—she had no idea what Fauna was rambling about. Then, the green CEO made her move. To resolve their rivalry and "help" them both prosper, she proposed merging NanaEleven with FaunaMart—offering a hefty sum of 55,000 coins in exchange.

NanaMoo, unimpressed, scoffed. "You take me for a fool?" she retorted mockingly, making it clear that 55,000 coins were mere pocket change to NanaEleven. Not only did she reject the offer outright, but she also exposed the truth—Fauna wasn’t even using her own money—it was Nerissa’s.

Fauna's plan was crumbling fast. She was being backed into a corner, her carefully laid-out scheme unraveling before her eyes. But then, something unexpected happened.

Instead of ridiculing Fauna further, NanaMoo revealed her true intentions for opening NanaEleven. It was never about competing—it was about ensuring FaunaMart's survival. She knew FaunaMart was a scam and that people would never support such a business. Without customers, Fauna’s dream of building a library would remain just that—a dream. So NanaEleven was born, acting as the bright, honest alternative that the people could trust. By gaining their support and amassing funds, NanaEleven was, in truth, securing FaunaMart’s future. It was an elaborate plan—and it had worked flawlessly.

Fauna was speechless. Moved. Her respect for the brown maiden soared higher than ever, and her vision grew clearer—she now saw a world where every corner held a FaunaMart and a NanaEleven, side by side. With NanaMoo by her side, the future had never looked brighter.
