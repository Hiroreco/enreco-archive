<!-- title: Always There -->

On the last day, Nerissa had her hands full. Between trying to stop the corruption, mending Gonathon and Amelia’s relationship, assisting FaunaMart, and collecting Bijou’s books, she barely had a moment to breathe. Meanwhile, Shiori—who arguably had more free time than anyone else—wasn’t the type to actively seek interaction. She simply drifted around aimlessly until she bumped into someone, only then engaging in conversation.

Their circumstances couldn’t have been more different, yet whenever they crossed paths, they always seemed to bounce off each other effortlessly.

To Shiori, Nerissa was just another person—aside from their unofficial bond of marriage, she saw her as just some woman who really liked talking to other women.Meanwhile, Nerissa viewed Shiori as that crazy lady—not in a bad way, though. She had long since grown accustomed to Shiori’s antics. Sometimes, the Oreo woman would spout the most outrageous things, and Nerissa wouldn’t even blink (well, most of the time). And when she noticed that the Stain failed to corrupt Shiori, she barely gave it a second thought, simply assuming Shiori had already been corrupted—just in a [fun way](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared\&t=731).

Out of everyone in the kingdom, Nerissa was one of the few who could handle Shiori’s shenanigans like second nature. And for good reason—she genuinely cared about her. Sure, Nerissa was kind by nature, but her bond with Shiori was something different, something special. In fact, their lovey-dovey relationship was probably one of the most stable and unshaken in the entire kingdom.

So when Shiori found herself contemplating her fate—staring down the daunting reality of raising a child as a single mother with barely any resources—Nerissa stepped in without hesitation, offering her everything she needed.

Some might argue that Nerissa was only doing it to get Shiori out of the way so Gonathon and Amelia could have their reunion in peace. But even if that moment had never happened, there was no doubt she would have done the same thing regardless.

After all, they were technically the first to be wedded. And through all the chaos, all the absurdity, they remained together until the very last day, without a single hitch in between.

Because a relationship like that could only exist between two people who truly cared for each other.
