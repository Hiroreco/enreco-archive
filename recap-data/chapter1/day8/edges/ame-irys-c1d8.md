<!-- title: Non-Traditional Relation -->

The Hot Pink One had heard the heartbreaking tale of Gonathon and Amelia Watson. She sympathized with the poor knight, never expecting such a beautiful love story to take such a [tragic turn](https://x.com/irys_en/status/1831979038820450676). She wished him nothing but the best and, as his guildmate, resolved to support him however she could. If there was anything she could do, it was to keep her head cool, be there for Gonathon if he ever needed help, and, if it would make him happy, even extend that help to Amelia.

At the same time, she reflected on her own relationship with her eternal consort, determined to cherish it and avoid meeting such a sorrowful fate.

Yeah, she totally should do that.

Or at least, she was trying to—until she met Amelia.

It started harmlessly, but then the blonde pointed out something peculiar: the Pink One’s hat reminded her of someone. And that was when it snapped—the pink lady's old tendencies resurfaced.

Seizing the perfect opportunity, the Pink One took advantage of Amelia’s fragmented memories, spinning a web of deception. She tricked the blonde into believing that she was her beloved—not Gonathon. To the Hot Pink One’s delight—and Ina’s absolute horror—Amelia believed her.

Things escalated when Gonathon arrived. With no hesitation, the Pink One boldly declared to his face that Amelia was her Pearl, and the knight in orange was furious.

It was truly an act of villainy—something no one would expect from a supposed beacon of empathy, and yet, it was so in character for the Hot Pink One. For a moment, she basked in her self-proclaimed victory.

And then—everything came crashing down.

Shiori happened to stumble upon the scene, and with a mischievous smirk, she [exposed](https://www.youtube.com/live/pH9lSCrTVMY?feature=shared&t=2059) the Pink One, revealing that she had been entangled in multiple affairs at the same time. That was the beginning of the end.

Amelia’s trust in the pink woman wavered. She studied her diamond, frowning as she murmured that it felt foggy and impure. Doubt took root, and realization struck—she had been tricked. The moment she understood the truth, she broke free from the Pink One’s grasp.

Not only that, Ina and Bijou soon joined in, confronting the Pink One for her betrayal. The confrontation erupted into a full-blown spectacle, drawing the attention of the entire kingdom.

Caught red-handed and with no way out, the Pink One was left frantically apologizing to everyone, scrambling to salvage what little dignity she had left. It was like a scene ripped straight from a drama movie—except this time, she was the antagonist getting her long-overdue karma.
