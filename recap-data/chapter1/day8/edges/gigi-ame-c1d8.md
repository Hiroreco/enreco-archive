<!-- title: A Knight's Wish -->

Gonathon was worried sick when he stumbled upon his former companion, Amelia, frantically searching for the "diamonds" she had lost. It didn’t help that the kingdom was in utter chaos, corruption spreading like wildfire. He feared that her very identity was being torn apart—caught between his Pearl, the woman he once knew, and Amelia Watson, the detective she had become. As much as he longed to stay by her side, he had more pressing matters to attend to, and he respected her path, choosing instead to watch from the sidelines. And yet, reality painted a different picture.

Time and time again, by pure chance, Gonathon found himself near Amelia throughout the day. He would overhear her [private conversation](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=1184) with the King, stumble upon her while she was interrogating [Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=1504), and even catch her reading [A Knight’s Tale](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=3315)—a book he had poured his heart and soul into. Amelia even stalked him, for god’s sake. It was as if the universe itself was trying to tell him something, whispering that perhaps, just perhaps, there was still a chance for them to walk hand-in-hand once more.

He gave the blonde another book he'd quickly written down, hoping it'd remind her of something, anything.

Whether this wish of his was genuine or just a fleeting moment of longing, he would soon find out.

After the corruption had been vanquished, while helping others rebuild, Gonathon received an urgent call from Ina, requesting his presence immediately. When he arrived, he was met with a gut-wrenching sight—the Hot Pink One had deceived Amelia, twisting reality to make the detective believe she was wedded to her.

Gonathon was torn. He had told himself before that he would respect Amelia’s choices, no matter the path she chose. But this—this was not right. Something within him stirred, an ember that had refused to die despite all the hardships he had endured. He was still in love with his Pearl. And he wanted her back. Justice had to be served.

And as if the universe had answered his plea, the Hot Pink One was punished for her deception, and Amelia was freed from her grasp (see [Hot Pink One-Amelia: Non-Traditional Relation](#edge:ame-irys)). Gonathon wasted no time. He pulled Amelia aside, his voice firm yet earnest, telling her not to trust the pink woman, hoping—praying—that she would trust him instead.

Then, the wheels began to turn.

Hints and signs flooded Amelia’s path, coming from everyone she met (see [Amelia’s POV](#node:ame)), all leading her to a single revelation—the diamond she had been searching for all this time had been right in front of her. The knight in orange. And with one final push from Nerissa, urging her to meet Gonathon at the onsen, the long-awaited reunion finally arrived.

Gonathon laid his heart bare.

He spoke of their adventures, their bonds, and the moments they had shared. He told her everything he had been holding in for so long, his words raw with emotion. He wished to be with her once more—to experience those moments again, to reclaim what they had lost.

Amelia, skeptical at first—after all, she had been deceived before—slowly allowed herself to trust his words. The diamonds she held sang in resonance, glowing in response to the sincerity Gonathon displayed. And though she still could not remember everything, she wanted to. Or rather, she wanted to start again. To live that life once more. With him.

But there was one final test.

She would see it through the last battle against the Stain King. She would watch Gonathon fight, witness his might, his unwavering will. And through that, she would decide if his words were truly honest.

And so, Gonathon fought—not just for himself, but for his friends, for what was right, for his ideals, for her.

And in the end, he emerged victorious.

At long last, the two were reunited, finally able to spend the moments they had yearned for, the moments they had been cruelly robbed of. It was a love story—one of beauty and emotion, of hardships and triumphs.

[Together, at last. Huzzah!](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=12776)

From enemies to lovers. From opposition to unity.

Gonathon, the ever-loyal husband. Amelia, the ever-quirky yet loving wife.

A knight’s tale. A knight’s wish.

A story to be told for generations to come.
