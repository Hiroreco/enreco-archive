<!-- title: Keeping My Promise -->

_"I will always be by your side."_ A promise far easier said than done. Elizabeth understood that better than anyone. As a knight, she bore the burden of protecting others, standing as their shield, and being there when they needed her most. Caring for those she loved wasn’t just an instinct—it was her duty. But at the same time, being a knight meant upholding virtue, standing for righteousness, and banishing all that was wrong. So when those two ideals clashed—when duty to a loved one contradicted duty to justice—what was the right choice? That was the dilemma Elizabeth faced on this final day.

Mococo, someone she had sworn to protect, someone she had promised to always stand by, had succumbed to corruption. She was spreading chaos throughout the kingdom—an undeniable act of evil. Elizabeth tried to stop her. She tried to reason with her. But Mococo wouldn't listen. Wouldn’t—or couldn’t—[stop](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=10033).

And when Mococo pleaded, begged, and insisted that it wasn’t her, that she wasn’t the one doing all these horrible things… Elizabeth had no choice but to reject her. And in doing so, she broke the promise she had made on the very first day. It was heart-wrenching—for both of them. Mococo, who had always been terrified of being alone, now found herself more alone than ever. Feared. Avoided. Even abandoned by the person she trusted most.

And Elizabeth? She did what a knight should do. She upheld righteousness. She made the _right_ choice. So why did it hurt so much? Why did it feel like she had just shattered something irreplaceable? She had cut ties with someone who had looked up to her. Someone who had seen her as a big sister. Someone she had sworn to protect. But in this moment, it felt like she had done the opposite.

Even so, Elizabeth refused to let things end like this. She believed in redemption—not just for Mococo, but for herself as well. And with sheer determination—and the help of her comrades—they found the cure to the corruption. Through an elaborate plan, they freed those who had been afflicted, including Mococo. And at last, the two were reunited.

Elizabeth apologized—apologized for the harsh words she had spoken, for abandoning her in her darkest moment. Yes, she had done what many knights should have done. But just because something was _just_ didn’t mean it was the only path.

She had learned something that day—something far more important than chivalry or duty. That being a knight wasn’t about following rigid orders. It wasn’t about doing what was expected of her.

It was about following her heart. It was about fighting—not just for justice, but for the people she loved.
