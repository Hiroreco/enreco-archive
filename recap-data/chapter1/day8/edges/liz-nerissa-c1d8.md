<!-- title: Start Again -->

Even on the very last day, the shenanigans between Elizabeth and Nerissa showed no signs of stopping. Amidst the kingdom’s chaotic struggle against the spreading corruption, the two still found time to try and one-up each other. Well—mostly Elizabeth, as the red knight simply couldn’t let Nerissa take all the credit for being Gonathon’s [wingman](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=8905).

The moment was lighthearted, a much-needed contrast to the grim atmosphere looming over the kingdom. To Elizabeth, Nerissa was an important companion. Sure, she had accused the blue maiden of being a witch countless times. And yes, that so-called witch had given her plenty of headaches. But in the end, Elizabeth still valued her.

However, no matter how deep their connection was, the scarlet knight would never put Nerissa above her King. When Nerissa spewed her wild theories about the King being corrupted, Elizabeth dismissed them outright, claiming that even if it were true, she would still serve him without hesitation.

And yet, despite what she said, her knightly heart and her innate sense of justice told a different story. Nerissa, without a doubt, was one of Elizabeth’s closest companions—far more so than the King himself. Witch or not, delusional or not, the scarlet knight would never stand idly by if her companion was in danger.

And on this day, that truth was put to the test.

As the corruption spread, consuming everything in its path, Elizabeth discovered that Nerissa had succumbed to it. But rather than recoiling in fear or condemning her, Elizabeth did something unexpected—she confronted Nerissa directly, taking her by the hand and dragging her into Mori’s tavern. She refused to give up on the blue maiden, believing that no matter how far she had fallen, it was never too late. The kindness within her was still there, buried beneath the corruption. And if there was even a sliver of a chance to save her, Elizabeth would take it.

With determination and effort, the corruption was finally defeated, and Nerissa was brought back to her usual self. And just like that, they were back to their antics again. To commemorate the occasion, Nerissa gifted Elizabeth some books titled "Nerissa Ravencroft x Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame." Just from the name alone, it was obvious how Elizabeth would [react](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=15714).

Even as the journey came to an end, the two remained inseparable, constantly flocking to each other, locked in their endless [banter](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=19277). Their relationship was odd, chaotic, and utterly unique—but it was beautiful all the same. And surely, the future held even more for them.
