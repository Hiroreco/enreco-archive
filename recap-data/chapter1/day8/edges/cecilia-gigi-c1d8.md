<!-- title: Mysterious Messages -->

Cecilia and Gonathon barely interacted throughout their time in the kingdom. Aside from a brief moment on the seventh day, their encounters were few and fleeting—mostly consisting of Cecilia asking for money or Gonathon taking jabs at her for being a fake lawyer.

And yet, they—out of everyone—were the only two to experience a strange phenomenon.

On the final day, mere minutes before the battle with the Stain King, cryptic messages surfaced in both their minds [simultaneously](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared\&t=10298):

"You mustn't forget"."Hidden, where your allegiance lies".
"The four hues... which one?"

This wasn’t the first time something like this had happened. Cecilia recalled experiencing similar messages back on the second day. But what did they mean? Who was sending them? Forget what? What allegiance? And why, of all people, were they the only ones receiving these messages?

With time running out, the two independently began theorizing, trying to decipher the clues before the battle. They speculated that "the four hues" might represent the four guilds of the kingdom and that the answers they sought could be hidden within their respective guilds.

Acting quickly, Cecilia rushed to the Scarlet Wand [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared\&t=7362) base, while [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared\&t=10343) made his way to the Cerulean Cup’s. And sure enough, they found something.

Within a hidden chest in both bases lay three diamonds—and a book, which read:"Do not forget".
"What you have lost".
...Great. That told them absolutely nothing.
With no time to discuss further, they left it as it was. But the fact remained—something was being hidden. Something connected the two of them in ways neither had realized.
And only time would reveal the truth.
