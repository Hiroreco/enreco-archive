Fuwawa began her final day in the kingdom with a heavy heart. The once-thriving lands surrounding her small hut were in disarray—fire burned through the fields, leaves withered on the trees, and faint traces of blood stained the ground. Most heartbreaking of all, her beloved [chickens](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=394), the source of so much joy and companionship, had vanished without a trace.

Desperate for answers, Fuwawa turned to [Gonathon and Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=808), the two people she trusted most. They explained that a terrible corruption had spread throughout the kingdom, and worse still, her close companion Mococo had fallen victim to it. Fuwawa's fears were soon realized as she witnessed Mococo's rampage firsthand. The once-kind and playful companion now spread chaos, howling rabidly as she tore through the land.

The others warned Fuwawa that if Mococo couldn't be stopped, there was a grim possibility she would have to face justice in the [gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=1204). This news crushed Fuwawa. The kingdom's usual lighthearted atmosphere was gone, replaced by grim faces and solemn tones. Even Elizabeth, who had always been warm and supportive, wore a [heavy expression](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=1298) that mirrored the weight of the situation.

But the fluffy one refused to let despair consume her. She had always been a beacon of joy and warmth for others, and now more than ever, she needed to remain true to herself. Determined to find hope amidst the chaos, Fuwawa began hatching a new flock of [chickens](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=2002). Their fluffy white feathers and cheerful chirps brought her a glimmer of happiness, even if only for a fleeting moment.

However, the peace didn’t last. Fuwawa heard Mococo’s agonized cries and, unable to bear seeing her companion in such pain, rushed to her side. Unbeknownst to her, it was a trap. Mococo, fully corrupted, lured Fuwawa close enough to spread the Stain to her as well.

Now corrupted, Fuwawa joined Nerissa and Mococo in wreaking havoc across the kingdom. The Stain twisted her mind, forcing her to destroy the very fields she had cherished and even [turn against](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=2925) her beloved chickens, slaying them in a fit of feral rage. Fuwawa’s [screams](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=3519) echoed across the land—cries of pain and torment from someone who no longer had control over her actions.

Thanks to the unwavering efforts of the other heroes, the corruption was ultimately [cleansed](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=3973) from Fuwawa, Mococo, and the others. Although Fuwawa was heartbroken to find her chickens gone once again, she found solace in knowing that the Stain’s grip had been broken. Ever resilient, she resolved to rebuild. This time, she hatched more chickens than ever before, determined to protect them and regain a sense of normalcy.

...

Her joy was short-lived, however, as Mococo—by accident—decimated the flock once again.

Despite her lingering sadness, Fuwawa joined the others in the [final battle](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=7996). Together, they fought valiantly and defeated the Stain, only to uncover a deeper truth: the true threat all along had been the King (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).

With the battle over, Fuwawa and the others returned to the mysterious [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/31OnEJrRDfU?feature=shared&t=9750), marking the end of her first chapter.
