<!-- title: Mococo Abyssguard -->
<!-- status: Corrupted -->

Mococo awoke to an unsettling sight: a barren field, once full of thriving crops, now reduced to [ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=332). Confusion swept over her—she had no memory of coming to the field, let alone causing the destruction. It was as if she had blacked out and awoken to this desolation. Before she could process the scene, Calli started accusing her of raiding the crops and fields. To make matters worse, the reaper pointed out the Stain Hat perched on Mococo’s head, something she couldn’t explain.

The pressure was overwhelming. Mococo began to break down under the weight of fear and guilt. Just then, Bijou appeared, offering comforting words and gentle headpats that momentarily soothed Mococo’s panic. But Bijou’s kindness was a façade—a ploy to lower Mococo’s defenses and allow the Stain to fully corrupt her.

Corruption soon consumed Mococo’s mind. Her thoughts were no longer her own as she spread chaos across the land, unleashing terrifying howls that sent others [fleeing](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=1315). When confronted, she would run away, unable to face those who sought to help her. A lingering sense of guilt and her natural cowardice occasionally disrupted the Stain’s hold on her, giving her brief moments of clarity. During one such moment, Mococo wandered through town searching for someone she could trust.

Her search led her to Elizabeth, the Scarlet Knight she admired and trusted deeply—a sister figure who had protected her since the beginning of their journey. Relief washed over Mococo as she approached Elizabeth, hoping for solace. But the reaction she received was far from what she had expected (see [Elizabeth-Mococo: Keeping My Promise](#edge:mococo-liz)).

Abandoned and betrayed in her eyes, Mococo’s despair allowed the Stain to tighten its grip [once more](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=1743). Fully corrupted, she spiraled into chaos, spreading destruction with her feral screams. It was agony—pain she couldn’t control. Even her closest companion, Fuwawa, fell victim to her corruption, and together, the two wreaked havoc across the land.

But hope was not lost. Through an elaborate plan and unwavering dedication, Ina and the other heroes—including Elizabeth—crafted a cure to combat the corruption. Their efforts succeeded, pulling Mococo and the others out of the darkness. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, Mococo no longer felt hated or abandoned. She was embraced by those who had fought tirelessly to [save her](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=4020).

Sober once more, Mococo resolved to make amends. Before the final battle, she returned to her old vice: [gambling](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=5633). At least this kind of "corruption" was harmless in comparison. Though her winnings were modest, she felt victorious in spirit. Mococo then turned her attention to cleaning up the mess she had caused, even stopping by FaunaMart to claim some overdue funds. For the first time in a while, life felt peaceful.

As part of her redemption, Mococo decided to help Fuwawa with the chickens, hoping to make up for the chaos she’d unleashed upon them before. However, her sharp claws got the better of her again, and the chickens unfortunately met another untimely end.

After the final battle, Mococo and her companions uncovered the truth about the king (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)). They were then returned to the mysterious [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/6TXwZjXEoxk?feature=shared&t=9745), marking the end of the first chapter in Mococo’s journey.
