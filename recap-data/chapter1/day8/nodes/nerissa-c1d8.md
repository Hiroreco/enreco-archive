Nerissa arrived on the final day to a scene of pure devastation. The fields lay in ruin, fire and withered leaves painting a grim picture of corruption seeping through the kingdom. It was an ugly sight, and she had a strong suspicion about who was behind it all. Yet, to her surprise, Elizabeth and Calli believed she might have been the culprit. Thankfully, she was able to clear [her name](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=780).

While wandering the kingdom, she eventually came face-to-face with the suspected culprit—Koseki Bijou.

Bijou was different. Ominous. The best way to describe her? Emo and chuuni. The gem princess revealed the truth—she had been corrupted and had joined the side of the Stains. Nerissa was taken aback, quickly declaring that this meant they were now enemies. But then, in a twist only fitting for her, the Stain Princess casually asked how to donate books to the library.

Instantly, Nerissa snapped into business mode, explaining the process like a seasoned employee. Corruption or not, business always came first (see [Bijou-Nerissa: Divorce No.3](#edge:nerissa-bijou)).

It was quite the chaotic start to the final day, but fitting. And this was only the beginning.

For days, Nerissa had speculated that the king was evil. She had voiced this theory to many, but few believed her. Still, she trusted her instincts. The blue maiden had always been upright and kind, and that wouldn't change now—not at the end. She was determined to protect those she loved and assist those she cared for. So, when Gonathon opened up about his heartbreaking situation with Amelia Watson, Nerissa became the ultimate wingwoman for their story.

That said, kindness wasn't her only trait—she was also quite cunning. When she learned that she had been tricked by Nanamoo, she wasted no time devising an elaborate plan to trick the owl lady right back (see [Nerissa-Fauna: My Money](#edge:fauna-nerissa)).

Things were going... okay, all things considered. But the corruption was still spreading, and Nerissa saw it firsthand. Throughout the kingdom, everyone was desperately trying to stop it—Gonathon, Elizabeth, and many others. Some, like Ina, were even fighting to save their loved ones from falling to it.

Nerissa wanted to stop the corruption, too. But fate had other plans.

It got to her.

She became part of Bijou’s Stain army. But only for a moment.

Just as she had helped others, she, too, was saved. A dashing knight in red—someone she had always had a complicated relationship with, yet who had always cared for her—pulled her from the pit of darkness (see [Nerissa-Elizabeth: Start Again](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

Now free from corruption, Nerissa wasted no time in [helping others](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=7467). She devised a clever trick—pretending to still be corrupted, donning the Stain Hat to lure others into Mori’s Tavern, where they could be trapped and cured. The plan worked perfectly. One by one, the corrupted were saved—Mococo, Fuwawa... but then there was Shiori.

Shiori was a special case. Though she wore the Stain Hat, she showed no signs of corruption. Drinking the cure changed nothing—she felt exactly the same as before. Odd, but not entirely unexpected. After all, this was her wife. (See [Nerissa-Shiori: Always There](#edge:shiori-nerissa)).

Finally, after saving Bijou, the corruption was over.

It had been a long, grueling arc, but at last, everything was resolved. Nerissa set about cleaning up the ruined kingdom, taking some time to unwind in the casino and strolling around, enjoying the peace and the delightful chaos her friends continued to stir up. If anyone needed help, she was there.

And then... the [final battle](https://www.youtube.com/live/qdYQ5j-0sQI?feature=shared&t=11577) arrived. It was tough. It was brutal. But with her trusty tuning fork and the other heroes by her side, they took down the Stain King. Victory, however, was short-lived.

Just as they celebrated, the truth about the King was revealed (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)). Nerissa’s theory had been right all along. And she was ecstatic about it.

In the end, everyone was brought back to the white room, marking the conclusion of their first journey. Nerissa went around exchanging hugs and farewells with those she had spent time with, capturing final commemorative photos with her guildmates. It had been a fun, unforgettable journey. And more awaited on the horizon.
