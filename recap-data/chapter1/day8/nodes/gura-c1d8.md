["Am I about to ride into chaos?"](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=421) Yes, Gura, the answer is yes. Joining a bit later than the others on the final day, it was no surprise that she had missed nearly all the earlier events. Oddly enough, Gura had managed to avoid most of the major shenanigans throughout her journey, somehow always slipping past the chaos while everyone else got entangled. It explained why her perspective on the story remained remarkably peaceful—at least compared to the others.

The first thing Gura did upon regrouping with everyone was perform the Scarlet Wand ritual by [touching tips](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=456) with her guildmates. During this, she learned about Nanamoo’s secret: retaining all her memories from a past life. Gura warned her to be cautious, joking that she might get kidnapped and sold for ransom. As Nanamoo wandered off into the bushes, Gura couldn’t resist throwing in a witty remark.

Gura then crossed paths with Amelia. Despite having rarely spoken to each other before, their interactions always seemed to convey an unusual closeness. Of course, their conversations often veered into questionable territory, like when Gura casually offered Amelia her ["meat."](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=733) Nevertheless, she wished the blonde maiden good luck in her search for her "diamonds."

Realizing that time was running out—only 15 minutes left until the end of the world—Gura rushed to finish her quests and dungeons. In her hurry, she accidentally [ignored](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=1525) Mococo, who had been trying to start a conversation.

She made it back to the kingdom with five minutes to spare, only to find everything in flames and flooded. Typical. Apologizing to [Mococo](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=3487) for brushing her off earlier, Gura then shouted to the sky, complaining that the end of the world seemed to be running [late](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=3720) (more than five minutes had passed by then).

Finally, the end came. As the final battle against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/cIb5yHw4mvk?feature=shared&t=3994) began, Gura weaved through the chaos, swinging her trident with precision. Chanting her Revelation, she unleashed powerful waves of water against her target. Amid the screams and screeches, she persevered, fighting alongside her comrades, until they emerged victorious.

But then came the most unexpected twist. The biggest revelation yet unfolded, shedding light on the king’s true intentions (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).

Still baffled and processing the truth, Gura and everyone else were sent back to the white box, the starting point of their journey. Ever the mischievous one, Gura noticed she still had her Warp Crystal. Using it, she managed to sneak back into the kingdom, where she wasn’t supposed to be.

Of course, the gods caught her in no time and promptly returned her to the white room with the others. Once there, Gura reunited with her fellow Scarlet Wand members for one last group tip-touching session.

But unfortunately, that moment truly was the shark’s final interaction with these silly heroes. Not long after, having been exposed as the one who stole the trident, she was found by the people of Atlantis and dragged back down to the depths.

Even so, the shark had already left her mark—one cherished by many. Her presence alone had become a legend, destined to be remembered for as long as time endures.
