The end of the world was afoot—or so everyone kept saying. Corruption plagued the lands, chaos spread like wildfire, and impending doom loomed over the horizon. For many, this would have been cause for panic, a time to reflect on their lives, relationships, and everything they’d built. But for our CEO? It was a business opportunity. What better way to capitalize on the apocalypse than with an End of the World Sale? After all, if the world was ending, everything must go.

It was classic Fauna: profits first, everything else later. Although she believed her business troubles had ended after the Mococo situation, she soon discovered a new rival in the market. NanaEleven, run by someone she once thought of as a friend—Nanamoo—was stealing customers. The rival store had become popular, selling more items and even lottery tickets, much to Fauna’s annoyance. As a savvy CEO, Fauna knew what had to be done. She’d eliminate the competition—not literally, of course, but in a business sense.

Preparing for the negotiation of her life, Fauna was interrupted by Nerissa, who approached her with a story about being tricked by Nanamoo and a request for a favor (see [Nerissa-Fauna: My Money](#edge:fauna-nerissa)). Before attending to that, though, Fauna got back to making sales. [Calli](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=473) stopped by FaunaMart to buy diamonds—closing the deal for a whopping 25,000 coins. Calli also mentioned the oncoming war and the corruption spreading across the kingdom, but Fauna barely batted an eye. She had more pressing matters to attend to.

Later, Fauna arranged a meeting with Nanamoo on the library's third floor. The two had the most intense business discussion of their careers (see [Fauna-Nanamoo: Deal Of The Century](#edge:moom-fauna)).

Afterward, Fauna made even more sales by selling battle gear to [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=2406). She also assisted Cecilia with her [ritual](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=2977) to control the princess. Bijou stopped by to donate some books to the library. It was amusing to note that despite receiving thousands of coins to build the library and its massive size, the library’s collection still consisted of only four books. The ones Bijou donated were... questionable, but Fauna had anticipated this, even setting up a dedicated section for them.

Gonathon visited next—seriously, FaunaMart was busy that day. He informed Fauna that Nerissa, her employee, had succumbed to the corruption. Fauna’s response? She couldn't care less, and congratulated Gonathon on winning the lottery two days prior and handed him his prize. Though puzzled by Fauna’s priorities, Gonathon accepted and even bought another 21 lottery tickets, contributing to the library fund.

Mococo also showed up to remind Fauna of the money owed to her from two days ago. To everyone’s surprise, Fauna actually paid her [back](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=5001). You really had to question the mindset of these "heroes," collecting debts on the day of the apocalypse.

As the final battle loomed, Fauna had a brilliant idea: sell battle gear to her fellow heroes at exorbitant prices. Knowing most were too preoccupied with the corruption to negotiate, she crafted shields and swords and made a [fortune](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=7180).

Then came the final showdown against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=7696). Even as chaos erupted and heroes were flattened left and right, Fauna’s capitalistic instincts kicked in. She attempted to charge for her [healing abilities](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=7796) but, seeing no buyers, ended up providing them for free.

Upon the Stain King’s defeat, a shocking twist left all the heroes reeling (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).

In the end, the heroes returned to the [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/8x-MVX8h9gU?feature=shared&t=9420) where their journey had begun. Thus concluded the story of our favorite green CEO. From being summoned as a hero, Fauna chose the unconventional path of becoming an "NPC" and opening her own business, inadvertently creating one of the story’s key plot points. Her dedication to making money and staying true to her ideals was unmatched.

Although her business practices often raised eyebrows, Fauna’s ability to establish capitalism in a fantasy setting—and create a convenience store that sold lottery tickets—was nothing short of genius. While this marked the end of her story, FaunaMart left an undeniable impression on everyone involved.

With the store closing and the library’s purpose fulfilled, the CEO bid farewell to her customers and supporters. As she ventured off onto a new journey, one thing was certain: Fauna’s wit, dedication, and entrepreneurial spirit would not be forgotten.

Faunwell, miss CEO.
