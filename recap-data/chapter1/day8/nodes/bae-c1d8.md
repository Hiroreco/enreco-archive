The kingdom's elusive hermit, Peasant The Bae, was in distress. Not a single soul had spoken her name since the first day. She had chosen a life of solitude in the woods, far from the chaos of the kingdom, but now, on the final day, she was dragged back into the fray. Lost, bewildered, and unsure of her purpose, even her friend, Three, wasn't called [Three](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=642) anymore. She clung to the only comfort she knew: a giant statue of Tam Gandr, the figure she had pledged her [allegiance to](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=732).

Her mind raced. Who could have brought her back? The answer was clear: the King. The devil in sheep's clothing. Her fury burned bright as she vowed to confront him and demand answers.

Her first interaction upon returning to the kingdom was with the infamous Sir Gonathon. His reputation had even reached her secluded corner of the woods. Naturally, her greeting was to respectfully call his hat ["fugly."](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=1249)

As the day unfolded, Peasant The Bae’s confusion only deepened. A princess? Corruption? Queen Mario? None of it made any sense. Overwhelmed by the kingdom's strange developments, she pulled Sir Gonathon aside and insisted he take her to the King so she could unleash her anger.

Despite her frustration, she found fleeting moments of amusement. The ridiculously [long hats](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=1721) worn by some residents caught her attention, as did the drama of the Hot Pink One—a woman entangled in a dispute involving five wives. Bae was both astonished and spitefully compelled to mess with her (see [Bae-Hot Pink One: Pure Spite](#edge:bae-irys)).

Later, Bae visited the tavern, hoping for a meal, only to discover the exorbitant prices—hundreds of coins for a single item. She caused a ruckus, alternately accused of being crazy and poor. Nerissa, the wealthiest person in the kingdom, graciously offered her some money, but Bae’s pride wouldn’t allow her to accept. Instead, she boldly claimed to be wealthy enough to afford the tavern on her own.

Frustrated (and hungry), she cursed the gods for her suffering. At last the final battle was near, bringing the promise of an end to her ordeal. Armed with weapons as flimsy as paper, Bae took up the role of moral support while the other heroes bore the brunt of the fight. Together, they defeated the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=4028), only to uncover a devastating truth about their monarch (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).

In the end, Peasant The Bae returned to the [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/t5NGryTaGqk?feature=shared&t=5760) where her journey had begun.
