It was the final day, and while everyone frantically worked to end Bijou’s corruption saga, Shiori had other plans. She was focused on advancing her ultimate goal—a "Happy Sugar Life".

While wandering around the kingdom, Shiori crossed paths with Bijou, who gifted her a Stain Hat and, in a surprising twist, nominated her as the [Stain Prince](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared\&t=448). For most people, wearing the Stain Hat would have been alarming, as it caused corruption. But Shiori? She felt exactly the same. Even Nerissa, puzzled by how the corruption cure didn’t work on her, speculated, "Shiori’s already corrupted, but in a fun way". Shiori, naturally, found this amusing and even entertained the idea of spreading the corruption, affectionately calling it "her children".

Determined to pursue her "Happy Sugar Life," Shiori proposed to [Ina](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared\&t=830), suggesting that Ina join her polycule so they could spread corruption together. However, Ina seemed less enthusiastic about the whole corruption thing and declined. That was one failed attempt—on to the next.

Shiori later met Gonathon and learned about his heartbreak over Amelia Watson. Although she had once considered including him in her polycule, she chose to respect his loyalty and feelings. Instead, she gifted him a cherry sapling as a token of her [condolences](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared\&t=1165).

Next, Shiori targeted [Nanamoo](https://www.youtube.com/live/dTf0g5tqzBU?feature=shared\&t=1889). She channeled all of her "rizz," introducing herself as the Archiver of Hearts, whose mission was to archive relationships by marrying people. With all her charisma, she tried convincing the owl lady to join her polycule. But Nanamoo wasn’t interested in being a side chick—she wanted to be the main one. Feeling slighted, she declined and ran off. Another fail.

Just when Shiori thought her plans couldn’t get worse, Bijou—her wife—filed for divorce at Mori’s Tavern (see [Shiori-Bijou: Divorce No.1](#edge:shiori-nyavella-koseki-bijou-right-2-left-2)).

Now single, wifeless, and a single mother to a Stain child, Shiori went around the kingdom seeking sustenance to raise her "child". Elizabeth and Mococo, moved by her story, gave her food. She eventually ended up in the onsen, contemplating how her dream of a "Happy Sugar Life" surrounded by women had instead left her alone, with no women and a child to care for.

As Shiori pondered her predicament, she realized she wasn’t entirely alone. She still had one woman by her side (see [Shiori-Nerissa: Always There](#edge:shiori-nyavella-nerissa-ravencroft-bottom-2-top-2)).

Finally, everyone was urgently summoned to the kingdom gates for one last battle against the Stain King. True to form, Shiori, ever the chill one, stood back and watched as the heroes faced the King head-on. But this time, the Stain King wasn’t leaving her out of the action.

When the heroes finally bested the Stain King, they uncovered the painful truth about the ruler of Libestal (read [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).

And with that, everyone was returned to where their journey had first begun: the white box. Thus marked the end of their first adventure.
