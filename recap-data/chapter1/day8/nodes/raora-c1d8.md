The corruption was spreading, dark tendrils slowly consuming the world. Mario, understandably, was not a fan. On the final day, she awoke to a ruined kingdom. Mococo, completely overtaken by the Stain on her hand, was rampaging and spreading [chaos](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=650). But what broke Mario’s heart most was that the root of it all was her own daughter, Koseki Bijou. The sight of her kingdom in shambles and her beloved child in such a state weighed heavily on her soul.

Even so, Mario refused to give in to despair. There were still others searching for a way to stop the corruption. She teamed up with Gonathon and Ina to [discuss](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=855) a potential cure: a legendary golden apple said to cleanse the Stain. During their planning, Mario uncovered a stunning truth—Ina was her long-lost daughter (see [Mario-Ina: Mother?](#edge:raora-ina)).

Fueled by newfound hope, Mario and Ina set out to find the golden apples. Their journey was a success, and they managed to craft a [cure](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=2153) for the corruption. Quickly reuniting with their comrades, they devised a bold plan: lure the corrupted individuals into Mori’s Tavern and force them to drink the cure. Time was running out as the corruption claimed more victims, including Nerissa and Fuwawa.

The plan, though risky, worked for most of the corrupted. Bijou, however, was another matter entirely. She rejected Mario not just as her mother but also as a friend. She renounced her humanity altogether, succumbing completely to the Stain. The rejection cut deeply, leaving Mario devastated by her perceived failure.

The situation only grew more painful when Mario had to witness her daughters face off in the arena. It was the only way to compel Bijou to drink the cure. Watching her children fight was excruciating—what mother could bear such a sight? But Mario had no choice but to endure. In the end, Ina emerged victorious, and Bijou, defeated, was forced to drink the cure. The Stain Princess was no more, and the corruption’s hold was broken.

The family reunion that followed was bittersweet and deeply emotional. Mario, overjoyed, embraced her daughters, finally free from the shadow of the Stain.

With the corruption behind them, Mario had a rare opportunity to relax and reconnect with the people around her. She greeted Peasant The Bae, a long-lost member of the Amber Coin, gifting her a [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=5460). She indulged in moments of playful grandeur, standing on her throne to feel like the queen she always claimed to be. She joined in on the chicken game, relishing the lighter side of life.

But the peace was short-lived. Mario joined the heroes for one final confrontation: a battle against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=7691). Yet the ultimate revelation shattered their understanding—it wasn’t the Stains that were truly evil but someone they never would have suspected (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king)).

And so, the journey came full [circle](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gou89O6CzmY?feature=shared&t=9344). The heroes found themselves back in the white room where it had all begun. From being lost and confused to building her castle, firing her knight, becoming a mother, and declaring herself queen, Mario had carved out her own path in this strange kingdom.
