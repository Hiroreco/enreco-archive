Throughout her journey, Elizabeth experienced flashes of memories—snapshots of her time in the kingdom. They ranged from moments of deep camaraderie to reflections on her ideals. But this time, the memory was different—darker and more vivid.

In her vision, Elizabeth trudged through a land once bright and lively, now consumed by fire and decay. The sight was grim: charred fields, crumbled homes, and lifeless landscapes. She wanted to believe it was a nightmare, but the heavy air told her it was all too real. The corruption—the vile force she had sworn to protect against—had spread far and wide.

Just the day before, Elizabeth had bid her companions farewell, leaving the kingdom in its usual harmony. But something sinister had unfolded in her absence. Bloodstains and scorched crops marred the once-thriving land. Most heartbreaking of all were the remains of her beloved chickens, raised with care and affection, now gone. Grief turned to resolve—Elizabeth vowed to find the culprit and deliver [justice](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=990).

Awakening in the ruined kingdom, Elizabeth stood alone. Amid the desolation, only a solitary red knight remained. The loneliness was suffocating. To honor her lost chickens, she built a small memorial before beginning the arduous task of cleaning the ruined land by herself.

Companionship came only when the other heroes awoke. Among them were Calli, the trusted tavern owner, and Elizabeth’s guildmate. Together, they speculated on the corruption’s [origins](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=5396). Initially, Elizabeth suspected Nerissa, the "witch," but Nerissa proclaimed her innocence. Suspicion then fell on Koseki Bijou, whose behavior had grown increasingly erratic.

Determined to uncover the truth, Elizabeth drank an invisibility potion, intending to spy on Bijou. But her stealth attempt ended in a less-than-graceful predicament.

Despite the setbacks, Elizabeth’s confrontation with Bijou yielded critical evidence: the princess was indeed [corrupted](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=7533). In a private conversation with Calli, Elizabeth learned unsettling secrets about the [kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=7755). Guards spoke in cryptic riddles, and her guild’s presence in the castle had seemingly vanished. Elizabeth trusted Calli’s words but struggled to reconcile these revelations with her loyalty to the kingdom.

Suspicion weighed heavily on Elizabeth’s mind, and even small interactions between her companions sparked doubt. When Nerissa and Amelia entered the onsen together, Elizabeth’s curiosity led her to drink another invisibility potion—only to find herself in yet another sticky situation.

Despite her struggles with stealth, Elizabeth’s interactions with her quirky comrades began to soften her once-hardened demeanor. Her stoic facade cracked when Gonathon mentioned Fuwawa’s outrageous claim that the chickens Elizabeth had lovingly raised were [hers](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=9134).

These fleeting moments reminded Elizabeth that she wasn’t alone. She didn’t have to shoulder the burden of the kingdom’s salvation by herself—her comrades were there to support her.

Yet, these moments of solace were brief. News spread that Mococo, a member of the Jade Sword and someone Elizabeth cared for deeply, had fallen to corruption. Witnessing Mococo’s descent firsthand was devastating. Elizabeth, who had long fought to protect her, now faced the grim possibility of having to end her suffering (see [Elizabeth-Mococo: Keeping My Promise](#edge:mococo-liz)).

When hope seemed lost, Ina and Raora arrived with news of a potential cure for the corruption. But there was no time to waste—Fuwawa, too, succumbed to the corruption right before Elizabeth’s [eyes](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=11473), slaughtering her remaining chickens. With Calli, Gonathon, Raora, and Ina, Elizabeth devised a desperate plan: disrupt the corrupted ones’ minds with music, creating an opening to administer the cure.

The plan was perilous but necessary. Elizabeth faced her target head-on, determined to save even those who had caused her pain (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Start Again](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

Against all odds, the cure worked. One by one, the corrupted were freed. Though Elizabeth’s heart ached at Mococo and Fuwawa’s resistance, she pressed on, knowing their salvation was worth every effort.

After a grueling battle, the group watched as Koseki Bijou—once corrupted and now freed—drank the cure, breaking the chains of the [Stain Princess](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=13749).

Peace returned, though it was accompanied by the kingdom’s usual antics. From Shiori’s revelation of being a [single mother](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=15484) to a child with Elizabeth’s former daughter to spicy novels pairing Elizabeth and Nerissa, the chaos was a welcome reprieve from the horrors of corruption.

Following a final group picture, Elizabeth and her comrades prepared for their ultimate battle against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=16809). The fight was fierce, but the heroes triumphed.

However, their victory revealed a devastating truth: the king they had sworn to protect was the true villain (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)). Elizabeth, defined by her unwavering loyalty to the king, was thrown into turmoil. Could her beacon of light truly have been the source of such darkness?

Unable to raise her sword at first, Elizabeth clung to denial. But the sight of her friends in pain—Mococo suffering most of all—shattered her resolve. The king had to pay for his betrayal. And so, for the first time, Elizabeth wielded her blade not for her king, but for her comrades.

When the journey ended, the heroes found themselves once again in the white room where it all [began](https://www.youtube.com/live/_urPfTQnLes?feature=shared&t=18386).
