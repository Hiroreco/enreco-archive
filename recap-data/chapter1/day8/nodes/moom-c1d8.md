<!-- title: Nanamoo -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Nanamoo began her final day overhearing whispers about plans to corrupt the world, destroy the lands, and terrorize the lives of its people. After careful consideration, she decided that... it probably wasn’t important and continued on [her way](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=216). She then shared a brief exchange with Ina, proudly asserting that she was the ["main chick,"](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=385) not the side.

Getting sidetracked aside, Nanamoo had a critical mission that day. She had recently launched her business venture, NanaEleven, which had gained immense popularity thanks to her lottery tickets. The tickets seemed like an incredible deal, with winners walking away with hundreds of coins. What the buyers didn’t realize was that hidden on each ticket was a clause written in an ancient language. This clause legally obligated them to contribute a portion of their income to NanaEleven "for the greater good."

Her goal was simple: to collect what she was owed. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned. Nerissa, whom she believed to be wealthy, turned out to be nearly broke (though unknown to Nanamoo, she’d been tricked—see [Nerissa-Fauna: My Money](#edge:fauna-nerissa)). Similarly, Gonathon, another supposed high-roller, had already spent most of his wealth on [others](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=2891).

Despite the setbacks, Nanamoo wasn’t discouraged. Her business had already made a name for itself, and that was all she needed. NanaEleven wasn’t just a convenience store; it was the cornerstone of her larger scheme to support and elevate FaunaMart (see [Fauna-Nanamoo: Deal Of The Century](#edge:moom-fauna)).

Later, she engaged in some more dubious activities, including selling [diamonds](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=2154) to a schizophrenic Amelia and having a very questionable conversation with [Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=5064). As the day progressed, Nanamoo regrouped with her Scarlet Wand guildmates to prepare for the final dungeon. Before their journey, Nanamoo unveiled the secret she’d been harboring since day one.

Unlike everyone else in the kingdom, Nanamoo hadn’t lost her memory upon arriving. She pretended to have amnesia to avoid standing out and being labeled as a weirdo. She confessed to her friends that, in her old world, she had lots of friends, drove a Ferrari, and was an incredibly cool person overall. While she feared being judged, her friends’ reactions were warm and supportive. This touched Nanamoo deeply, though unbeknownst to her, they just thought she was eccentric and humored her to avoid hurting her feelings.

During a moment of downtime, Nanamoo received a call from a familiar yet unexpected person: Peasant The Bae, who had been dragged back to the kingdom after being lost in the woods. Nanamoo comforted her in the most friendly way possible—by calling her [crazy](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=4574).

After assisting her comrades in the Ancient Sewer dungeon, the final showdown against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=7584) was upon them. Nanamoo initially planned to stay on the sidelines and watch everyone else get flattened while relaxing. Instead, she ended up getting [flattened herself](https://www.youtube.com/live/oq_4QZacuso?feature=shared&t=8078).

Despite the challenges, the heroes triumphed over the Stain King. But their victory was overshadowed by a devastating revelation about the king they had been serving (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king)).

As the heroes returned to the white room where their journey began, they were a mix of joyful and shaken, reflecting on the bonds they had forged and the adventures they had shared. But then came the final, heartbreaking twist.

Nanamoo, upon returning to the white room, forgot everything that had transpired during her time in Libestal. The adventure, the king, the convenience stores, and, most tragically, the friendships she had formed—all vanished from her memory (see [Cecilia-Nanamoo: Oh, she forgot...](#edge:moom-cecilia)).

...

And as much as everyone would love to see her story continue, it seems that Nanamoo’s journey ends here—at least for now.

Despite her circumstances and her health, she pushed herself beyond her limits—not just for herself, but to ensure that everyone she loved had the best time possible. She gave it her all, embracing every moment with her usual silliness and charm, leaving behind memories that will be cherished by many.

Her shenanigans, her laughter, and her presence—they will truly be missed.

Thank you for everything, Mumei.
