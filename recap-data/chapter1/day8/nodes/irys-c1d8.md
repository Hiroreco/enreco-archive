The Hot Pink One realized she had missed quite a bit leading up to the final day. The only thing she could clearly recall was the heartbreaking separation between Gonathon and his Pearl. Still, she had just enough time to reconnect with everyone before the grand showdown.

Her first stop was the Cerulean Cup’s area, where she admired the Tam Gandr statue that Gonathon had recently completed. She couldn’t help but question the ominous Moai statue standing next to it—what was that about? Then, she finally found where everyone was: gathered around Mori’s Tavern. Excited to say hi, she joined the crowd.

Suddenly, chaos erupted.

"Take that hat off!"
"Consort, take that hat off immediately!"


Confused, the Hot Pink One quickly realized that the Stain Hat she was wearing was the cause of everyone’s panic. Apparently, the hat had been corrupting others, just like how Bijou had been spreading her influence. However, the Hot Pink One felt no different at all. Gonathon, observing her calm demeanor, speculated that she was immune to corruption because she was "full of empathy." Huzzah for her?

Spotting Nanamoo nearby, she went over to say hi and learned some exciting news: "The Red One" had been found somewhere in the kingdom. The Hot Pink One was eager to meet "The Red One," perhaps to expand her ever-growing circle of side chicks (see read [Hot Pink One-Peasant Da Bae: Pure Spite](#edge:bae-irys)).

After watching a duel between Bijou and Ina in the [arena](https://www.youtube.com/live/pH9lSCrTVMY?feature=shared\&t=1056), and witnessing the princess being cured, the Hot Pink One stumbled upon Amelia. The blonde maiden was frantically searching for her "diamonds." Having heard the tale between Amelia and Gonathon, the Hot Pink One immediately knew what those "diamonds" were and felt a pang of sympathy for Amelia. But when the distressed maiden asked the Hot Pink One if she was the "diamonds" Amelia had been searching for, the pink lady’s response was utterly shocking (read [Hot Pink One-Amelia Watson: Non-Traditional Relation](#edge:ame-irys)).

Following that incident, the Hot Pink One’s once-thriving circle of side chicks began to fall apart (see [Bijou-Hot Pink One: Divorce #2](#edge:bijou-irys)). One by one, her three side chicks decided to break up with her, leaving her with only her eternal consort (see [Ina-Hot Pink One: Forever My Consort](#edge:irys-ina)).

After the [final showdown](https://www.youtube.com/live/pH9lSCrTVMY?feature=shared\&t=4287), and learning about the kingdom's secrets (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)), everyone was returned to the white box, where their journey had first begun, the Hot Pink One took a moment to greet her guildmates and friends one last time. And thus, her journey reached a fiery, fitting conclusion. We now await the next chapter of her enigmatic story to unfold in the future.
