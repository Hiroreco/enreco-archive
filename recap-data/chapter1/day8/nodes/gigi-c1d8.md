It was the day of reckoning, the finale that would decide the fate of everything. Gonathon was faced with two major challenges ahead of him: the looming final battle against the king and the escalating corruption wrought by the Stain Princess, Koseki Bijou. The day had just begun, and things were already getting out of hand. Nerissa informed him of the corruption spreading rapidly, leaving the kingdom’s fields ravaged. The sight was grim, but Gonathon resolved to put an end to it.

Before investigating further, he encountered Amelia Watson, who seemed... off. Her disheveled appearance, erratic behavior, and nonsensical ramblings about finding these ["diamonds"](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=727) unnerved him.

At times, she even resorted to desperate, almost threatening behaviors like leaping off buildings. Concerned for her well-being, Gonathon [offered](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=1184) her diamonds to ease her anxiety and reassure her that things would be okay. Though hesitant, he asked Amelia to assist him in investigating the corruption, a task he thought fitting for the detective.

As much as Gonathon wanted to spend more time with Amelia, there were more urgent matters. Gonathon confronted Bijou to set matters straight. During their exchange, he learned that the sentient entity on her head, named Joe Mama, played a critical role in her corruption. When he asked to touch [Joe Mama](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=1606), Bijou refused, heightening his suspicion. Gonathon then decided to follow the princess, sneakily observing her actions from a distance.

He discovered Bijou writing a cryptic book, its contents likely meant to spread her corruption further. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Gonathon sought help from [Ina and Mario](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=4187). Together, they devised a plan to create the _Essence of Empathy_, an ancient cure for corruption. However, they still faced a challenge: how could they get Bijou to drink it?

Before they could act, tragedy struck again. Bijou’s influence spread to Fuwawa, who succumbed to the corruption. To make matters worse, the chickens Fuwawa had entrusted Gonathon to protect were slaughtered. Soon after, Nerissa, his companion throughout, fell to the corruption as well. Overwhelmed with guilt, Gonathon felt like a failure; his efforts seemed to have saved no one.

Was this truly the end? No. He didn’t have to shoulder this burden alone. This wasn’t just his fight; his comrades—Ina, Elizabeth, and Calli—were there, preparing the cure. Together, they devised a daring plan: lure the corrupted ones into the tavern, trap them, and administer the Essence of Empathy.

The plan was risky but [successful](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=7019). One by one, the corrupted were cured, and the kingdom slowly began to heal. Gonathon felt an immense weight lifted from his shoulders. His efforts had not been in vain.

With peace beginning to return, Gonathon’s thoughts lingered on Amelia. Was she still obsessed with diamonds? His worry was interrupted by an urgent call from Ina, summoning him to address one final challenge—a test of his unwavering devotion to Amelia (see [Gonathon-Amelia: A Knight's Wish](#edge:gigi-ame)).

And then came the final battle. Everything had led to this moment. Gonathon, alongside the other heroes, faced the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=11048) in a grueling and merciless fight. Every blow he landed was fueled by his righteous spirit and his determination to protect his loved ones.

The victory was hard-won, but the celebration was short-lived. A cruel twist awaited the heroes, shaking them to their cores (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).

The heroes were returned to the [white room](https://www.youtube.com/live/WvRIdaH107U?feature=shared&t=12694), marking the conclusion of their first journey. Though the twist left everyone shaken, Gonathon chose to focus on spending his final moments with those who had been by his side.
