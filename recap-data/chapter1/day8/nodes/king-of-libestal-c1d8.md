The heroes and their guildmasters stood at the kingdom’s gate, the very place where their journey had begun. Now, they gathered once more, preparing for what could be their final battle. The fight ahead would be their most grueling yet, but they had come a long way—stronger, sharper, and more determined than ever.

As the battle against the Stain King commenced, the struggle was immense. Many heroes were knocked down, their strength tested to the absolute limit. But through sheer perseverance, through their unyielding bonds, they fought on—and at long last, they emerged victorious.

With their greatest foe vanquished, the heroes erupted in celebration. More than anything, they couldn't wait to return to the King and deliver the joyous news—his kingdom was safe, the world saved from impending doom.

But upon their return, an unthinkable sight awaited them.

The kingdom was in ruins. Instead of cheering citizens and a land free from corruption, darkness had swallowed the city whole. Corruption ran rampant, covering buildings and twisting the streets into a nightmarish sight. Not a single citizen was in sight. It was a scene of wreckage and chaos.

Shock took hold of the heroes, but before they could process what had happened, one by one, their guildmasters began to disappear. Each of them cried for help, but their voices were snuffed out into nothingness, vanishing into the void before anyone could react.

Rushing toward the castle, the heroes desperately sought answers—was the King still safe?

Then, the King's chuckle echoed through the throne room.

It wasn’t a chuckle of relief or joy. It was mocking, twisted, and laced with malice. The truth came crashing down.

The King had tricked them. This had all been part of his plan. The kingdom, the Stains, the war—it had all been a ruse. With the heroes’ victory, he had finally been "freed."

No longer bound by his shackles, the King revealed his true self. His small, kindly form twisted and contorted, warping into a hideous monstrosity wrapped in chains. *The Captive* had awakened.

With chains wrapped around his body, The Captive lashed out. Chains cracked through the air, binding and battering the heroes. His strikes were relentless, his malice suffocating.

But he had underestimated them. The heroes, burning with fury and betrayal, fought with everything they had. All seventeen of them, their combined power shaking the very ground. They struck him down. Blow after blow, they refused to let up. And at last, The Captive fell… Or so they thought.

Despite its body crumbling, it refused to die. The chains still writhed, and the dark presence lingered. Before the heroes could react, a soft voice whispered into their minds.

It was gentle yet urgent, pleading for them to leave. The kingdom was collapsing, and if they stayed, they would be swallowed by the darkness. This wasn’t the end, the voice assured them. There was more to come. Trusting the voice, the heroes fled through the crumbling ruins. And then—

They returned to the white room. The same place where it all began. Thus, the first tale in this enigmatic journey came to a close.
