Why was the world so [dark and gloomy](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=291)? Calli pondered this as she faced her final day in the kingdom. Withering trees, raging fires, and ravaged fields stretched as far as her eyes could see. Something sinister had happened. It didn’t take long for her to confront a potential culprit: Koseki Bijou, known now as the *Stain Princess*.

Calli could sense the malevolence radiating from the corrupted gem maiden. Although Bijou denied responsibility for the destruction, she admitted to taking pleasure in the chaos. Calli swore to bring her to justice.

The corruption spreading through the kingdom had even reached Calli’s beloved [tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=882), a place she’d worked tirelessly to build. Seeking a plan, she discussed the dire situation with her guildmate, [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=1831). They needed to act swiftly before the corruption consumed everything. Adding to the turmoil, Jyonathan—whose true identity Calli had not yet recalled—was behaving oddly, obsessing over ["diamonds"](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=2441) in an unsettling manner.

Calli’s suspicions about the kingdom’s leadership deepened when Nerissa invited her to explore the [castle](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=3441). Together, they uncovered its many secrets, though the investigation was briefly derailed when Bijou ambushed Calli with a *"[Joe Mama"](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=4073)* joke. Very sinister indeed.

Later, Calli ventured into the Ancient Sewer Dungeon to recover the last missing fragments of her memories. There, she realized that Jyonathan was none other than [Amelia Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=7646).

Though the reaper lacked the combat skills of her allies or the investigative genius of others, she had her own unique talents: running a tavern and mastering the culinary arts. Embracing her role, she began preparing vast amounts of food to support her friends in their fight against the corruption. When hope dwindled, as materials for crafting cures ran scarce, Calli stepped up and single-handedly saved the day by making the necessary cures [herself](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=8071).

The cures worked. Through a collaborative effort, the corrupted individuals were freed, and the kingdom began to stabilize.

With the chaos subsiding, everyone gathered at Calli’s tavern to celebrate. It was the most patrons her establishment had ever seen—a moment that would have filled her with joy if only her customers had money to pay for their [meals](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=11522).

Unexpectedly, however, Calli made sales more meaningful than any food order. Her tavern, aptly named Death Do Us Part, wasn’t just a place for meals—it was also a venue for divorce services. Since its opening, this side of her business had remained dormant, as the kingdom’s couples were too lovey-dovey to require her services. But Calli had always believed that one day, she’d get her chance. That day had come.

On the final day, Calli achieved her long-awaited goal, securing her first three divorce sales: one for [Bijou and Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=11280), another for [Bijou and the Hot Pink One](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=11701), and a third for [Bijou and Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/evcruocvE3g?feature=shared&t=12162). The princess boasted about being freed from the shackles of marriage, much to Calli's delight.

When the final battle arrived, Calli and her allies faced off against the Stain King, vanquishing him in an epic confrontation. Along the way, they uncovered the shocking truths about the real king’s dark secrets (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)). Their journey concluded as they were returned to the mysterious white room, marking the end of this chapter in Calli’s tale.

Before signing off, Calli left one last remark, addressing a peculiar customer review of her food.
