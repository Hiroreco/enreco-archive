Amelia’s final day in the kingdom began in an unusual and unsettling way. Her wide, sleepless eyes hinted at countless restless nights, and her inventory was filled to the brim with stacks of diamonds. Her movements were erratic, her words nonsensical, and every conversation she initiated revolved around the same frantic questions, spoken in a shaky tone: _"Have you seen my diamond?"_ and _"Did you give me these diamonds?"_ Her behavior left her companions uneasy and deeply concerned.

When asked what had happened, Amelia could only recall vague memories of diamonds, tied to an inexplicable sense of urgency. She insisted she had to retrieve them, as though her life depended on it. One by one, she questioned her friends—Elizabeth, Calli, and Nerissa—leaving them confused and alarmed. [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=655), in particular, watched in distress as the detective he cherished began leaping from high places and engaging in increasingly reckless behavior.

Amelia’s obsession drove her to confront the king, whom she suspected of stealing her diamonds. Her usual wit and charm were replaced by raw desperation as she hurled accusations at the King, hissed at the guards, and uttered threats she’d never spoken before.

Why was the blonde so consumed by these diamonds? Even she didn’t know. She only knew they held something precious—perhaps a memory, perhaps a bond. Frustration and despair began to erode her composure, yet her frenzied state ironically [shielded](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=1354) her from the corrupting influence of the Stain Princess, Koseki Bijou.

While scouring the library for answers, Amelia was inexplicably drawn to a particular shelf. One book caught her attention, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t retrieve it. Nerissa, passing by in her ghostly form, lent a helping hand—after unintentionally scaring Amelia half to death.

The book’s contents didn’t immediately clarify Amelia’s plight, but Nerissa interpreted its tale. She spoke of a knight described as a ["diamond,"](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=2807) a revelation that stirred something deep within Amelia’s foggy mind. Slowly, faint images began to surface—a silhouette, blurry but familiar. Though she couldn’t piece everything together yet, this discovery helped Amelia calm down and regain a semblance of her [usual self](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=3113).

Still, her obsession lingered. Even as the kingdom spiraled into chaos, with corruption spreading and Mococo’s screams echoing through the land, Amelia remained fixated on her [diamonds](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=4279). Her companions, realizing the significance of her quest, began guiding her toward the truth.

- [Calli](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=3960) purchased every diamond from FaunaMart to deter Amelia, urging her to search within herself for the true diamond.
- [Ina](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=3591) hinted that she should journey eastward, toward the Cerulean Cup guild.
- [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=8343) advised her to seek a knight dressed in orange.

Amelia retreated to the onsen she had built, sorting through her [thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=8404). The clues all pointed to one person: Gonathon. Perhaps he held the key to her questions. But just as she prepared to find him, a chaotic force intervened—a figure known as the Hot Pink One (see [Hot Pink One-Amelia Watson: Non-Traditional Relation](#edge:ame-irys)).

With guidance from [Raora and Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=9121), who confirmed the Hot Pink One’s deception, Amelia managed to evade her traps and press onward. Finally, with Nerissa’s push, she and Gonathon unraveled the mystery (see [Gonathon-Amelia: A Knight’s Wish](#edge:gigi-ame)).

When the final battle arrived, Amelia had fully regained her sense of self. Alongside her friends, she wielded her magnifying glass against the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=10901), fighting with determination. Though they emerged victorious, the battle revealed a shocking twist—the true villain was someone they hadn’t anticipated (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)).

The group was ultimately returned to the white room, marking the end of their chapter in this [enigmatic adventure](https://www.youtube.com/live/mxOT9QEg5dI?feature=shared&t=12549).

Amelia’s journey throughout this tale was a testament to her quirks and spirit. She remained curious, witty, and ever-investigative, with a playful streak that brought light to even the darkest moments. Her sunny demeanor and relentless determination to solve mysteries left an indelible mark on her companions. Whether or not her path crosses theirs again, her impact is undeniable, and whichever path she decides to tackle next will surely be met with unwavering support and respect.

Thank you for your service, detective.
