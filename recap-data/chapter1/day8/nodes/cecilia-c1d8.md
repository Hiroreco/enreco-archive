The final day had arrived, and if there was ever a day for Cecilia to execute her plan to take over the kingdom by controlling the princess, it was now. Everything was ready—only the sacred ritual remained, along with gifting the princess the "cake" to seize control of her mind.

Part of the ritual required the involvement of someone Cecilia considered an ally. Naturally, she stopped by FaunaMart to ask her green companion to fulfill that role. By chance, Amelia was also there, frantically searching for the "diamonds" she'd been obsessing over all day. Cecilia didn’t really understand what Amelia was on about, but tried to help her [nonetheless](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=875).

Not long after, Gonathon and Ina approached Cecilia to ask if the library had any records of an ancient tale about a golden apple rumored to cure the "corruption." Cecilia, not quite understanding why they needed it, recalled that the library did have the book, so she handed it over.

Only later, after receiving explanations from the others and seeing the corruption firsthand, did Cecilia start to grasp its nature. Instead of being scared or sad that her friends were succumbing to it, Cecilia was... upset. Upset that she still didn’t fully understand what was so bad about the corruption.

Sure, it was destroying crops, which might be a problem, but it didn’t seem like the end of the world. More importantly, Koseki Bijou—the princess—was at the center of the corruption. This revelation threw a wrench into Cecilia’s plan. If the princess’s mind was already under the control of the Stain on her head, Cecilia’s efforts to control her would be [pointless](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=2080).

Still, she pressed on. With Fauna's assistance, the ritual was completed, and the special cake needed for the plan was ready.

With time to spare, Cecilia decided to hang out with her friends. She shared more of her crackhead theory about the king with Nanamoo and Fauna, going on about how he was evil, yada yada yada, the usual [yap](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=3652).

Finally, the princess was cured. Cecilia met with her, preparing to execute the final step of her plan (for more details, see [Cecilia-Bijou: Mission Success?](#edge:bijou-cecilia)).

Did it work? In Cecilia’s heart, it did, and that was all that mattered. Afterward, she helped others catch up with the final dungeon and prepared herself for the showdown. However, during this time, something strange occurred. Red text—similar to what she’d seen on day two—suddenly appeared in Cecilia’s mind. Strangely, Gonathon experienced the same phenomenon simultaneously. What could it mean? (See [Cecilia-Gonathon: Mysterious Messages](#edge:cecilia-gigi)).

Finally, the climactic battle arrived. Upon their [victory](https://www.youtube.com/live/4co7VDSYTqU?feature=shared&t=8430), the heroes learned the cruel truth about the king (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)). Cecilia’s wild theory about the king being evil—the one many dismissed as nonsense—turned out to be true.

Still baffled by her own genius, Cecilia and the others were returned to the white box where their journey had begun. Should she be happy or sad that her theory was right? She wasn’t sure. After all, it was hard to tell whether she was a hero or a villain, considering her plan to control the princess’s mind. But that was a story for another time. For now, Cecilia wanted to enjoy her final moments with her guildmates—friends she’d bonded with throughout the journey—and Nanamoo, someone she’d only recently grown close to but felt deeply connected with.

But as Cecilia called Nanamoo over for a group picture, she was met with a response that left her heart heavy (see [Cecilia-Nanamoo: Oh, she forgot...](#edge:moom-cecilia)).
