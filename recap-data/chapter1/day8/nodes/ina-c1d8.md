Her sister was corrupted, and saving her was Ina’s top priority as she embarked on the final day of her journey. Though the kingdom faced an imminent and perilous threat, nothing mattered more to her than her sister. As she wandered through the kingdom, she spotted her sister standing atop the bleeding moai statue. It was evident she had succumbed completely to the corruption.

Ina approached, ready to plead for her sister’s return—but was interrupted by the ringing of Bijou's phone. With a sigh (laugh), she put the confrontation on hold to address a more pressing matter: planning a cure.

Gathering with Gonathon and Mario, Ina recalled the nursery rhymes from her childhood, tales of a magical golden apple capable of cleansing corruption. Gonathon suggested consulting the kingdom’s library for records of such an item, and they sought Cecilia’s help. It was during this discussion that Ina learned of her connection to Mario: Mario was her mother (see [Mario-Ina: Mother?](#edge:raora-ina))

The group hurried to the library, where Cecilia unearthed a book with a cryptic clue pointing to the apple's location. It described the entrance as a "fiery perishment where rebirth awaits." Ina recognized it immediately: the Volcanic Dungeon. Furthermore, they were also given a map of the location.

Alongside Mario, she journeyed to its entrance, where they found not one but [two golden apples](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=1718).

The legends were true. Using the apples, Slime Jams, melon slices, and a bucket of milk, Ina crafted a remedy she called the [Essence of Empathy](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=2070)—a cure for the corruption.

However, the victory was short-lived. Mococo, Fuwawa, and Nerissa had also fallen to corruption, and Ina’s two potions wouldn’t suffice. As the group scrambled for alternatives, the tavern owner, Calli, stepped in to help. Her vast collection of exotic resources allowed her to replicate the cure, ensuring there was enough [for all](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=2619).

The group devised a daring plan: they would use music to distract the corrupted ones, luring them into Calli’s tavern where they’d be trapped and forced to drink the cure. The plan was risky but worth the attempt.

To their relief, it worked. One by one, the corrupted individuals were cured—until only the Stain Princess herself, Bijou, remained. The princess, too cunning to fall for their tricks, resisted with all her might. Knowing she was weakened, Ina proposed a duel: the loser would yield to the winner’s demand (see [Ina-Bijou: Wooden Shovel](#edge:bijou-ina)).

The battle was fierce and evenly matched, but Ina ultimately triumphed. Bijou, bound by their agreement, drank the cure. The corruption was vanquished at last.

Though the threat was gone, the heroes knew peace would be fleeting. Another challenge loomed on the horizon. But for now, Ina allowed herself to savor the moment—with her friends, comrades, family, and her delightfully chaotic wife (see [Ina-Hot Pink One: Forever My Consort](#edge:irys-ina)).

The final battle with the [Stain King](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=7620) brought one last cruel twist (see [King: The True Evil](#node:king-of-libestal)), sending the heroes back to the white room where their journey [began](https://www.youtube.com/live/NdWqpuyH0Zg?feature=shared&t=9255).
