It had been four days since the King had summoned the heroes to the kingdom, and he was pleased with how things had progressed. The heroes had performed admirably—they had defended the kingdom, steadily regained their memories, and grown stronger with each passing day. Yet, despite their successes, the King could not shake his growing unease. As the heroes' strength increased, so too did the power of the Stains—at an alarming rate that filled him with dread.

As he voiced his concerns, a sudden quake shook the castle. Almost immediately, his guards rushed in with urgent news—a massive host of Stains had gathered at the Storm Gate. This was a dire sign, but what troubled the King even more was the faint trace of Revelation emanating from the same location.

The gate led to the Ancient Sewer system beneath Libestal, a place steeped in mystery and long forgotten by most. Realizing the potential significance of this event, the King issued a direct command to the heroes—investigate the disturbance. If history was any indication, this could be another step toward regaining their lost memories, just as it had been in their past conquests.

Unlike the previous missions, which were assigned by the guild masters, this command came from the King himself, carrying far more weight than any before it. It was as if, beyond the walls of Libestal, the final storm was already beginning to take shape.
