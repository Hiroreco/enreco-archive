Fuwawa began her fourth day alongside Mococo, only to immediately hear her companion’s excitement about lottery tickets. As if that weren’t enough, Mococo eagerly discussed a money exploit with the Hot Pink One, planning to splurge her newfound wealth entirely on lottery tickets. The day had barely started, and Fuwawa was already unimpressed by Mococo’s relentless focus on [money](https://www.youtube.com/live/cYvEiwlPkW0?feature=shared&t=312).

Putting Mococo’s antics aside, Fuwawa wandered the kingdom spreading fluffy cheer and greeting everyone she met. She encountered Gonathon, who generously offered her a [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/cYvEiwlPkW0?feature=shared&t=780)—something she gladly accepted to help others differentiate her from Mococo, as their similar appearances often caused confusion.

Unexpectedly, Fuwawa found herself in a friendly duel with Elizabeth. Despite her soft and fluffy demeanor, Fuwawa emerged [victorious](https://www.youtube.com/live/cYvEiwlPkW0?feature=shared&t=1485), much to the surprise of onlookers. Her victory was a stark contrast to her calm and gentle nature, leaving many impressed. On the surface, her day seemed peaceful, but in reality, Fuwawa was working tirelessly to rein in Mococo’s reckless [behavior](https://www.youtube.com/live/cYvEiwlPkW0?feature=shared&t=1061).

Her companion’s financial exploits and shenanigans caused a ripple of chaos that Fuwawa couldn’t ignore, no matter how far apart they were. In the end, Fuwawa just gave up caring about the fuzzy one.

Later on, Fuwawa teamed up with Raora and Gonathon to tackle the _Volcanic Dungeon_. Amidst the fiery chaos, she [screamed](https://www.youtube.com/live/cYvEiwlPkW0?feature=shared&t=6910) her way through the journey, yet the group prevailed, recovering memories of _Takanashi Kiara_.
