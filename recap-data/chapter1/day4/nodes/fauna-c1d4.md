Fauna’s fourth day began with her favorite ritual: drawing the lottery. The jackpot had grown significantly since her first day and now stood at a staggering 3,502 coins—a truly life-changing sum. This impressive amount reflected the booming sales FaunaMart had seen on the previous day, and Fauna couldn’t help but feel excited about her thriving business empire.

The winning number of the day was _571_, but unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately for Fauna—there were no winners. With a grin, she shrugged it off, ["No winner, no problem,"](https://www.youtube.com/live/E2JxBxhda9I?feature=shared&t=736) as the jackpot continued to grow.

Her excitement was interrupted when she noticed some unusual activity behind her store. Curious, Fauna went to investigate, only to find Gura constructing [gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/E2JxBxhda9I?feature=shared&t=767). The sight left her both surprised and concerned. While it wasn’t necessarily bad in itself, the looming presence of the gallows behind FaunaMart seemed like questionable symbolism for her business, potentially scaring off customers.

Still, business waited for no one, and Fauna quickly shifted her focus back to her enterprise. Utilizing intelligence from her secret sources, she learned of an exploit in the kingdom’s systems. Blocks like lanterns could be broken and collected, and over time, they would regenerate. Fauna immediately saw the potential for an infinite resource farm. Since these blocks were in high demand, she decided to gather and resell them at "reasonable prices." With a smirk, she declared it the dawn of a new era for FaunaMart and dove into the task.

As she was gathering materials to sell, her plan was discovered by Bijou, and the kirin quickly extracted a [promise](https://www.youtube.com/live/E2JxBxhda9I?feature=shared&t=1100) not to reveal her new business idea. Soon after, Fauna joined forces with Gura and Jyonathan to explore the Eldritch Horror Dungeon. Along the way, the trio indulged in lighthearted banter. Jyon teased Fauna about whether the lottery was a scam, to which she firmly denied, pointing to [Mococo](https://www.youtube.com/live/E2JxBxhda9I?feature=shared&t=1621) as proof of its legitimacy.

Satisfied with her day’s adventures, Fauna decided to wind down. Despite being shorter than some, it had been an enjoyable and productive day.

Before logging off, Fauna reflected on her flourishing business. With sales surging and her time increasingly scarce, she realized she needed help managing the store. Turning to Nerissa, she extended a job offer, planting the seeds for the next phase of FaunaMart’s growth (see [Fauna-Nerissa: First Employee](#edge:fauna-nerissa)).
