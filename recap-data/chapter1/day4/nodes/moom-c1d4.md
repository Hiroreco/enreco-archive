<!-- title: Napoleon Galileo Aristotle Targaryen -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Another day, and you guessed it, another name for our brown lady. This time, she deemed herself as Napoleon Galileo Aristotle Targaryen. Now on her fourth moniker, she began her journey with the simple goal of trying to reclaim the money she had lost to gambling the previous day. Her strategy? Gamble again. Unfortunately, luck was not on her side, and after one swift loss, she promptly [walked away](https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?feature=shared&t=798) from the tables.

Not one to dwell on misfortune, Napoleon set out to catch up on the kingdom’s latest developments. She stumbled upon Raora, now known as Queen Mario, and Bijou, who had declared herself Princess of the Kingdom of Evergreen. The pair now identified as mother and daughter, much to Napoleon’s [bemusement](https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?feature=shared&t=912).

Continuing her exploration, she encountered Nerissa, who tempted her with a new item at FaunaMart: a stylish hat priced at 1,500 coins. Napoleon declined—not due to her lack of funds (though she didn’t have enough) but because of her staunch distrust of FaunaMart. To her, the store represented all that was wrong with commerce: shady practices, monopolistic tendencies, and deceitful advertising.

Her disdain for FaunaMart sparked an idea—a rival store. She envisioned [NanaEleven](https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?feature=shared&t=1257), a business that would stand in stark contrast to FaunaMart, offering fair prices and ethical practices. It was a bold plan, but one she tucked away for another time.

For now, Napoleon turned her attention to catching up on dungeon explorations. She joined forces with Ina, Shiori, Cecilia, and Bijou to tackle the _Eldritch Horror Dungeon_. The eerie and mysterious environment resonated with the group, and they successfully recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?feature=shared&t=4419) of _Ninomae Ina’nis_.

Right after, the group—with Calli substituting for Cecilia—moved on to the _Volcanic Dungeon_. This fiery trial tested their resolve, with countless challenges and setbacks. Despite the obstacles, they emerged victorious, recovering [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/PUlE34rNV-g?feature=shared&t=9426) of Takanashi Kiara.

As the day wound down, Napoleon crossed paths with the Hot Pink One, leading to one of the most baffling conversations of her life. Topics ranged from love triangles to side chicks, with Napoleon hilariously mistaking Raora for the actual Hot Pink One.
