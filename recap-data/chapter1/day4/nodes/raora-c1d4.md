Raora’s fourth day began much like her third—focused on completing her grand castle. She had poured her heart and soul into the project, dedicating countless hours to its construction. As she surveyed her nearly finished masterpiece, a sense of accomplishment welled up inside her.

She had single-handedly created a castle worthy of her queenly title. Yet, something felt amiss. The fiery motivation that once drove her seemed to have flickered out. Perhaps it was the absence of someone who had sparked that fire in the first place. Regardless, she pressed on, determined to bring her vision to completion.

Early in the day, Raora received a call from Gonathon, whose voice was feeling "kind of funny" and wanted to show Raora just for fun. Raora picked up, and [gaslit](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y0H168Iq8aY?feature=shared\&t=3874) the knight into thinking his voice sounded perfectly normal. Raora then welcomed Bijou and Cecilia for a tour of her castle. During the interaction, Raora officially claimed the title of *The Queen of the Kingdom of Evergreen*

Later, Raora turned her attention to more practical matters—her finances. To make a quick profit, she joined the others in exploiting a peculiar trend: crafting an excessive amount of potato salad. With her coffers replenished, Raora teamed up with Elizabeth and Nerissa to conquer the *Volcanic Dungeon*. The trio navigated the fiery trials with determination and recovered memories of [Takanashi Kiara](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y0H168Iq8aY?feature=shared\&t=15009).
