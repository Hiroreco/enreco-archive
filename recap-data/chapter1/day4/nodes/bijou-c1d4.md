Bijou stepped into her fourth day brimming with newfound confidence. Armed with a proper hat at last, she no longer felt the sting of being hatless in a world of headwear. Her day began with a tour of Queen Mario’s (formerly known as Raora) magnificent new [castle](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?feature=shared&t=505), a structure that left her thoroughly impressed. Feeling inspired, she met with Cecilia to showcase her own recent project: her lucky Moai statue.

It was amidst these events that Bijou claimed her title of princess—but not just any princess: the Princess of the Kingdom of Evergreen, with Cecilia as her knight (see [Cecilia-Bijou: The Royal Protector](#edge:bijou-cecilia)). Everyone around her seemed to be claiming grand titles like queens, so why not stake her own claim? Adding to the familial drama, she also announced that Queen Mario was now her mother, making her the proud daughter of two mothers: Elizabeth and Mario (see [Mario-Bijou: Mommy!](#edge:raora-bijou)).

Later in the day, Bijou joined forces with Shiori, Ina, Cecilia, and the whimsically named Napoleon Galileo Aristotle Targaryen to take on the Eldritch Horror Dungeon. Their quest was [successful](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?feature=shared&t=8517), though the celebratory moments took a bizarre turn with everyone indulging in some peculiar [licking antics](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?feature=shared&t=9603).

Anyway, they quickly regrouped for the _Volcanic Dungeon_, with Calli stepping in to replace Cecilia. The fiery dungeon proved particularly tough for Bijou, with several ["bweh"](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?feature=shared&t=10341) moments along the way, but the team triumphed in the end, recovering [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/ZV47e39yyMU?feature=shared&t=13502) of _Takanashi Kiara_.

As the day wound down, Bijou returned to the fiery dungeon, this time assisting Mococo and the Hot Pink One. After successfully lending her support, she called it a day. Bijou’s journey felt quieter compared to her earlier adventures—perhaps her drive had dimmed after achieving her ultimate goal of securing a hat.

What lay ahead for the rock princess? Would she find a new purpose to ignite her spark? Only time would tell.
