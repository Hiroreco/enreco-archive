A knight’s duty is to bring happiness to others—that much was clear to Elizabeth. From the very start of her journey, she had dedicated herself to that cause, striving to embody generosity and compassion. It was what her guild master and the King expected of her, and so she fulfilled that duty for their sake. And yet, something felt incomplete.
Deep down, she couldn’t shake the feeling that doing good because it was expected of her made it feel... forced.

Nonetheless, a new day was starting, with new adventures to come.

The scarlet maiden awoke from a long nap and wasted no time diving into one of her trademark monologues. She was informed by her daughter about the mysterious "winds" conspiring against her, spreading tales about her supposed desire to "wife" Nerissa. Naturally, Elizabeth brought this up during her usual talking-to-herself session.

In the middle of her rambling, Raora called in. Elizabeth found herself quite fond of the pink cat, partly because she listened to her (sometimes outlandish) claims without judgment. Their bond deepened when Raora gifted Elizabeth the Jade Sword [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=1042)—a gesture that left Elizabeth deeply touched. So much so that when Raora took a tumble, Elizabeth responded with dramatic cries and sniffles.

With trust firmly established, Elizabeth accepted Raora’s invitation to tackle the *Volcanic Dungeon* alongside Nerissa. The trio emerged victorious, recovering memories of [Takanashi Kiara](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=5895).

Upon returning to the kingdom, Elizabeth discovered that her guild area could trap people within its bounds. Fueled by curiosity (and a penchant for theatrics), she attempted to trap [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=7186) in Calli’s tavern for interrogation. Later, she tried the same trick on Nerissa, this time to force her into listening to music. Both attempts failed, leaving Elizabeth bewildered and mildly frustrated.

The day took a chaotic turn when Elizabeth became an impromptu guardian for Mococo, who was being pursued for allegedly placing a bounty on Nerissa’s head.

The situation spiraled when Gonathon, seeking answers about Mococo, challenged Elizabeth to a duel. Determined not to repeat her past humiliation at the hands of the Hot Pink One, Elizabeth gave the duel her all. She emerged victorious, earning the respect of onlookers.

However, her triumph was short-lived. As part of Gonathon’s terms for the duel, he forced Nerissa to utter a heart-wrenching phrase: "I hate you."

Elizabeth, the scarlet knight, was left heartbroken. The sweetness of her victory dissolved into bitterness (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Heartbroken](#edge:liz-nerissa)).
