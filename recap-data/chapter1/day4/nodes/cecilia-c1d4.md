<!-- title: Cecilia Immergreen -->

Cecilia joined the adventure on the fourth day, and within mere moments of her arrival, she became a knight to a princess. Abrupt? A little bit, yeah. But that was just the kind of chaotic energy the green lady brought with her (see [Cecilia-Bijou: Royal Protector](#edge:bijou-cecilia)).

Without much of a personal goal to pursue, Cecilia spent the day wandering around and chatting with people. Unlike others who were actively taking on quests, she had little motivation to do so. After all, she now had a princess to leech off of for money—what more could she ask for? Life was easy, and she was thriving.

But with so much free time on her hands, Cecilia’s mind began brewing something interesting. Something ambitious. Something that, if anyone were to hear it, would immediately put her status as both a hero and a knight into question. She would take over the kingdom. Simple as that.

The plan? Bijou would be the key. As a princess, she held the perfect status for Cecilia’s scheme. She would gain Bijou’s trust, slowly but surely, winning her over with charm and unwavering loyalty. And once the gem maiden was completely dependent on her? Cecilia would place her on the throne and pull the strings from the shadows, controlling her like a puppet. A royal usurpation, hidden behind a façade of loyalty.

If the already questionable crackhead theories about the kingdom weren’t enough to cast doubts on Cecilia’s sanity, well—this certainly would.
