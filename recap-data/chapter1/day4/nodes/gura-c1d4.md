<!-- title: Gawr Gura -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

The fourth day dawned on our shark girl, Gawr Gura, who recently uncovered her identity as the princess of Atlantis—the very one who had fled her kingdom, ultimately leading to its downfall. Despite this revelation, Gura felt largely unchanged. With her memories recovered but no burdens weighing her down, she eagerly embarked on another adventure in the kingdom.

Everywhere Gura turned, constructions upon constructions were popping up: FaunaMart, Calli’s diner, Raora’s castle, and more. Inspired, Gura decided it was time to create something of her own. Observing the kingdom’s rising crime rate, she settled on building… _[a gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=665)_. This contraption would serve as a beacon of justice, imprisoning wrongdoers and even incorporating public participation—citizens could throw eggs at the convicted for added flair.

Gura meticulously planned the structure, envisioning trapdoors for the guilty to drop through and cells to hold them indefinitely. With her enthusiasm at an all-time high, she dove headfirst into construction.

As she worked, Fauna approached, seemingly talking to herself. Gura concluded that Fauna might be the town’s resident [schizophrenic](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=3549). When Fauna noticed the gallows being built right behind FaunaMart, she expressed her concerns, fearing it might deter customers or project an ominous image for her store. Gura, however, assured her that justice required such measures.

Later, Gura met Jyonathan and invited her on a trip to the Eldritch Horror Dungeon. Jyonathan agreed, but only if Gura paid her a fee of 50 coins and informed her husband, Gonathon, of their plans. Begrudgingly, Gura complied. At the same time, the mischievous shark used the opportunity to stress out the poor wedded knight (see [Gonathon-Gura: Little Gnome Boy](#edge:gigi-gura)). With Fauna joining their party, the trio set off on their adventure. Their efforts culminated in the recovery of Ninomae Ina’nis’ memories (which Gura had not prepared [beforehand](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=7552)), marking a successful expedition.

Back in the kingdom, while working on her gallows, Gura was approached by Cecilia and other Scarlet Wand members. Cecilia revealed a clandestine plan to seize control of the princess and the kingdom. Unaware of the princess’s identity or Cecilia’s motivations, Gura was thoroughly baffled throughout the [discussion](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=11248). Nonetheless, she proudly introduced her gallows as a potential asset to their scheme, only to discover a critical flaw: criminals could escape using a magical tome.

Undeterred, Gura teamed up with Gonathon and Jyonathan to tackle the _Volcanic Dungeon_. The dungeon posed significant challenges, but its intricate contraptions fascinated Gura, who marveled at their [ingenuity](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=15828). The team ultimately emerged victorious, recovering [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=16175) of _Takanashi Kiara_.

With another successful day behind her, Gura called it a night, her mind racing with plans for justice, adventures, and perhaps some revisions to her gallows.
