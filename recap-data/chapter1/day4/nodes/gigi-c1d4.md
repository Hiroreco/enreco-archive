Gonathon’s fourth day began with a declaration from Bijou, who claimed herself to be the [princess](https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared\&t=521) of the kingdom, with Cecilia as her protector. Despite the peculiarity of this announcement, he went along with it. Shortly after, he [introduced](https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared\&t=736) Cecilia to his wife—his beloved "Pearl"—and shared his first interaction with Gura, who caused him quite the bit of headache throughout the day (see [Gonathon-Gura: Little Gnome Boy](#edge:gigi-gura)).

With the conversations out of the way, Gonathon shifted his focus back to his duties. As mentioned on day three, Tam Gandr, his queen, had embarked on an expedition and entrusted Gonathon with managing the kingdom in her absence. To honor her legacy, Gonathon resolved to construct a monumental commemorative statue of the queen. He began laying the groundwork for this ambitious project, determined to see it through despite the immense effort it would require.

Taking a break from the statue, Gonathon joined his wife and Gura to tackle the day’s dungeon—the *Volcanic Dungeon*. Navigating its perilous traps and obstacles, he valiantly tried to maintain his composure in front of his wife, though his pride took a hit as he repeatedly fell and screamed his way through the challenges.

After a hard-fought victory in the dungeon and recovering memories of [Takanashi Kiara](https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared\&t=8112), Gonathon returned to work on the queen’s statue. It was then that Elizabeth approached him, expressing her disapproval of the project, given her rocky relationship with Tam. Refusing to let her disdain deter him, Gonathon confronted Elizabeth, but their heated exchange resulted in her locking him up in a tavern.

By sheer luck, Gonathon managed to escape and shifted his focus to other matters. Acting on a report from Nerissa that Mococo was a criminal, Gonathon set out to hunt her down, albeit with no concrete evidence.[Doghunt](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/VgMSugOH5DA?feature=shared\&t=12009)

Unsatisfied with the lack of clarity, he challenged Elizabeth—Mococo’s guildmate—to a duel in hopes of extracting more information. Unfortunately, he lost the duel and, in an act of pettiness, enlisted Nerissa to deliver a stinging blow to Elizabeth’s pride by saying she hated her.

Despite his questionable actions, Gonathon redeemed himself by ending the day on a noble note. He joined Nerissa, Fuwawa, and the Hot Pink One in conquering the Eldritch Horror dungeon and later assisted Fuwawa in the Volcanic Dungeon.
