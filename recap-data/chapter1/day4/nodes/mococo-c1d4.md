Lottery! Lottery! Lottery! It was all Mococo could think about as she started her fourth day. The once innocent, shy doggo from the first day? She was no more. Money, monetary values, and gambling had completely taken over her thoughts. Her once-cute persona had evolved into a fiery embodiment of ambition, leaving everyone around her equally amused and alarmed. FaunaMart had transformed her into a true devotee of business, and she was eager to spread her enthusiasm to everyone she met.

Naturally, the first stop on her agenda was FaunaMart. Though she didn’t win that day’s ticket, the sight of the massive jackpot only fueled her determination. Mococo wasn’t one to be deterred by a single loss. Even without Fauna present, she found an opportunity to indulge her gambling craze when she discovered Nerissa, freshly appointed as a FaunaMart employee.

Of course, Mococo couldn’t resist buying lottery tickets from her. It was the same as always, a batch purchase of lottery tickets, nothing new, nothing special. So surely, nothing would go wrong… right? (See [Mococo-Nerissa: Lottery Fiasco](#edge:mococo-nerissa), a lot happened.)

Despite her money-driven fervor, Mococo still found time for adventuring. Later in the day, she tackled the _Volcanic Dungeon_ alongside the Hot Pink One and Bijou, [screaming and scrambling](https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?feature=shared&t=6904) through the fiery challenges. Emerging victorious, the group recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?feature=shared&t=9307) of _Takanashi Kiara_.
