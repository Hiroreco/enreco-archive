Seeing how business wasn’t booming as expected and realizing she had been making losses instead of profits (thanks to giving everything away for free to her less wealthy/very poor companions), Calli decided to take her fourth day a bit easier. Her goal was clear: make back the money she had lost.

Before Calli could dive into her money-making plans, she had to tackle the day's primary task—the conquest of the *Volcanic Dungeon*. She joined Bijou, Ina, Shiori, and Napoleon Galileo Aristotle Targaryen on the fiery adventure.

The dungeon’s intense, blazing environment brought to mind a familiar acquaintance, a fiery woman who perfectly matched this theme—Takanashi Kiara. True to its theme, the experience was chaotic. There was a lot of screaming, burning, and falling as the group battled their way through endless [challenges](https://www.youtube.com/live/1eOME6DuJK0?feature=shared\&t=2899).

After countless burns and more chaos than they could handle, the team finally emerged victorious, recovering [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/1eOME6DuJK0?feature=shared\&t=6018) of *Takanashi Kiara*.

With the dungeon behind her, Calli moved on to her main objective: making back her money. She began by trying her luck at the casino, but fortune wasn’t on her side—she ended up losing even more. Not one to give up, she turned her focus to the latest craze sweeping the group: potato salads.

The remaining hours of her day were spent crafting and selling these salads. Her efforts paid off in spades; not only did she recoup her losses, but she also ended the day with a significant profit. Not the most eventful day, but nonetheless a productive one.
