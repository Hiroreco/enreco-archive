Nerissa entered her fourth day with no grand ambitions. Much like the previous day, her goals were simple: go with the flow, build her house, and rake in as much money as possible.

Early in the day, Nerissa stumbled upon Gura’s latest project—a [gallows](https://www.youtube.com/live/dRCvSHBTvSk?feature=shared\&t=1198). The sight triggered an odd memory from her past life, though it wasn’t a pleasant one. The memory was hazy but carried the guilt of a criminal past. Shaking it off, she decided to help Gura test the gallows by volunteering Jyonathan as a participant.

Not long after, Fauna recruited Nerissa to work at FaunaMart, officially dubbing her an employee. During a chat with Raora, Nerissa learned about a money exploit that had everyone in the kingdom buzzing. Naturally, this piqued her interest, and she dove headfirst into the scheme. In just 94 minutes, the money-hungry raven amassed a fortune of over 6.9 thousand coins. Her relentless pursuit of wealth even led her to decline Cecilia’s invitation to join Bijou’s knights—money, after all, was the priority.

Flush with cash and satisfied with her grind, Nerissa joined Elizabeth and Raora to tackle the *Volcanic Dungeon*. The group’s teamwork led to a successful run, and they recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/dRCvSHBTvSk?feature=shared\&t=15014) of *Takanashi Kiara*.

Nerissa’s day was shaping up to be smooth and fulfilling. She had made a fortune, spent quality time with friends, and even braved a dungeon. It felt like a peaceful, productive day. That was until Mococo approached her with a request—lottery tickets. Not even Nerissa could expect such a simple confrontation would later throw a wrench into her tranquility in this kingdom (see [Mococo-Nerissa: Lottery Fiasco](#edge:mococo-nerissa-right-2-right-1) and [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Heartbroken](#edge:liz-nerissa-right-3-left-2))
