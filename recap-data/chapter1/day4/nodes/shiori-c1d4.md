The fourth day arrived, and Shiori decided it would be a calm, drama-free one—at least, that was her plan. After being thrust into one relationship drama after another over the past three days, she was desperate for tranquility. All she wanted was to build her humble abode and live a peaceful life.

The mere thought of more drama made her wary, and when Bijou called to invite her on a dungeon quest, Shiori hesitated, fearing she might have to play the "peacemaker" yet again. Memories of being berated for "abandoning the bros" the previous day still [lingered](https://www.youtube.com/live/N3v-MJXHQ0w?feature=shared\&t=472).

Before heading to the dungeon, Shiori spent some time with her "bros". Their conversations were far from typical, revolving around overthrowing the throne and constructing gallows. Just your everyday hero chatter in a kingdom you’re supposed to save.

Shiori eventually joined Bijou, Cecilia, Ina, and Napoleon Gallileo Aristotle Targaryen to tackle the Eldritch Horror Dungeon.

Right after, swapping Cecilia for Calli, the group proceeded to the *Volcanic Dungeon*. This journey proved to be a loud and chaotic ordeal. Shouts and screams echoed through the dungeon as one hero after another plunged into fiery pits of doom. Shiori, in particular, found herself screaming so much that Calli nearly lost her hearing.

After enduring the cacophony, the group emerged victorious, recovering the memories of Takanashi Kiara. Exhausted but satisfied, they returned to the kingdom. Once back, Shiori gathered materials—a simple yet enjoyable task for her—and resumed work on her small, [peaceful house](https://www.youtube.com/live/N3v-MJXHQ0w?feature=shared\&t=10605). As the sun set, she finally called it a day, cherishing the moments of calm she managed to carve out amidst the chaos.
