Having missed the third day, Ina returned to the kingdom eager to catch up on all the developments. Upon arriving at her guild’s build area, she was astounded by the flurry of construction that had taken place in her absence. The area now boasted a guild base, a Moai statue, and the massive, still-under-construction statue of Queen Tam Gandr, where Ina saw Gonathon fell to his doom.

Afterward, Ina spent time catching up with everyone, engaging in lighthearted conversations about Bijou’s new title as princess, the rise of Queen Mario, and other kingdom happenings. Feeling more connected, she joined Shiori, Cecilia, and Napoleon Galileo Aristotle Targaryen on a quest to tackle the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*.

The dungeon was an unsettling yet captivating place. Its cold and eerie atmosphere gave Ina an odd sense of comfort, almost as if she belonged there. As the group ventured further, Ina lingered behind to admire the haunting beauty of the dungeon. Floating [torii gates](https://www.youtube.com/live/KE-Qhw2T1CY?feature=shared\&t=2837) adorned an endless pool of water, their reflections creating a surreal scene.

As the dungeon unraveled its secrets, Ina began to sense an uncanny connection to the mysterious girl described in its depths—a girl accompanied by an enormous cluster of wriggling [tentacles](https://www.youtube.com/live/KE-Qhw2T1CY?feature=shared\&t=2848), who guided lost souls to their resting place. Piece by piece, the truth came to light: this girl was none other than herself. She rediscovered that she was *Ninomae Ina'nis*, a priestess of kindness and compassion, tasked with shepherding lost souls. The revelation stirred a mix of emotions within her, but ultimately brought a sense of fulfillment.

The team, with Calli stepping in to replace Cecilia, then set off for their next challenge: the *Volcanic Dungeon*. This quest was chaotic and filled with hilarity, with plenty of falls and screams [reverberating](https://www.youtube.com/live/KE-Qhw2T1CY?feature=shared\&t=6431) through the fiery caverns. Despite the mishaps, they emerged victorious, recovering [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/KE-Qhw2T1CY?feature=shared\&t=9581) of *Takanashi Kiara*.

As the day wound down, Ina encountered her eternal consort, who gifted her a token of their connection. Feeling content, the priestess retired for the day, reflecting on the revelations and bonds she had rediscovered.
