## Day 4: Fire and Lottery Fiasco

Day 4 brought even more tangled lines to the ever-growing relationship chart, as well as a fresh wave of self-proclaimed royalty. Koseki Bijou declared herself the _Princess of the Kingdom of Evergreen_, with Cecilia as her loyal knight and—somehow—Raora as her mother. This now meant Bijou had two moms. As if the chaos of one kingdom wasn’t enough, they went ahead and invented another.

The dungeon of the day was the [_Volcanic Dungeon_](https://x.com/hololive_En/status/1831150187605049574), and this one was no joke. Easily the most brutal challenge so far, it pushed our heroes to their absolute limits.

As the name suggests, fire and burning were the dominant themes, and oh boy, did everyone get firsthand experience. There was screaming, there was falling, and the total death count easily reached three digits. By the time they were done, the adventurers were little more than walking piles of charcoal. Their reward for enduring this fiery ordeal? The recovered memories of [_Takanashi Kiara_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3bQdV_sl08).

Not all of the day's events were a fiery disaster—some new interactions took place as well. One of the more unexpected pairings was Gura and Gonathon, who had never met before but seemed to get along... well, probably. Gonathon had also started the construction of a statue of Tam Gandr as a commemoration for his beloved queen.

But the true spectacle of the day wasn’t the dungeon, nor the new royal claims—it was the lottery fiasco between Mococo and Nerissa. What began as a simple mistake quickly spiraled into an all-out disaster.

One small blunder left Nerissa spending the entire day running for her life from a rabid, fuzzy dog with dangerously sharp claws, while Mococo’s unchecked greed eventually backfired, forcing her to go into hiding from everyone. Things escalated so wildly that it even turned into a lawsuit, courtesy of Mococo.
