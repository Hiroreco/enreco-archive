<!-- title: Mommy! -->

You know what’s better than having a mother? Having two mothers!

During a casual conversation with Cecilia and Raora, an epiphany struck Cecilia—Bijou might very well be the princess of the Kingdom of Evergreen. And why? Because she wore a crown on her head, of course. That was all the logic needed to confirm royal lineage. Coincidentally, Raora had declared herself the queen of her own kingdom. So, by extension—through a very questionable but completely undeniable line of reasoning—Raora had to be Bijou’s mother. That totally made sense… right?

Though there weren’t many traditional mother-daughter moments shared on this day, the foundation for this unexpected relationship had been laid. Perhaps, in the future, we’d see more of this impromptu family dynamic unfold.

After all, every princess needs a queenly mother figure—or in Bijou’s case, two.
