<!-- title: First Employee -->

Nerissa had always held a soft spot for Fauna in her heart. Watching her guildmate tirelessly work on building her business—whether legitimate or scammy—was nothing short of inspiring. Nerissa admired Fauna’s dedication and wanted to support her in any way possible. From gathering materials to offering emotional encouragement, she became Fauna’s dependable right-hand woman. So, when Fauna offered her the role of FaunaMart’s very first employee, Nerissa accepted without hesitation.

Her responsibilities included overseeing the store in Fauna’s absence, promoting its services, and making sales whenever opportunities arose. While Nerissa herself had no real need for money—her wealth was so vast she could easily buy FaunaMart outright if she wanted—she took on the role out of pure goodwill. Helping Fauna with her dream was reward enough for the blue maiden.

Nerissa got straight to business, trying to sell hats, lottery tickets, bascially anything to anyone she met. However, as enthusiastic as she was, Nerissa’s first day on the job proved more chaotic than expected (see [Nerissa-Mococo: Lottery Fiasco](#edge:mococo-nerissa-right-2-right-1)).
