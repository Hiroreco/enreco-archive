<!-- title: The Royal Protector -->

Cecilia was a simple soul, driven by one uncomplicated rule: she would serve anyone who wore a crown. So, when she spotted Bijou adorned with her gleaming gem-studded crown, Cecilia immediately knelt before her and swore her allegiance, pledging to become the Gem Princess’s loyal knight.

Raora, who aspired to royalty but lacked a crown, did not receive the same honor—because, well, no crown, no knight.

However, Cecilia wasn’t content with the plain title of "knight." It lacked the grandeur she envisioned, so she promoted herself to _"Lord Protector of the Princess of the Kingdom of Evergreen"_. While impressive in title, her qualifications for the role were... questionable at best. For one, she was perpetually broke. Her poverty stemmed from her steadfast refusal to complete side quests, a critical income source in the kingdom. Instead, Cecilia developed a reputation as a professional leech, always relying on others to get by.

Despite her shortcomings, Bijou seemed to enjoy her company, which was all that mattered. Cecilia even went out of her way to craft a small, makeshift [throne](https://www.youtube.com/live/yK3QZkOZ6bE?feature=shared&t=3190) for her princess—an endearing, if slightly shabby, gesture of devotion.

Cecilia briefly attempted to recruit Nerissa into joining her knightly ranks, but Nerissa politely [declined](https://www.youtube.com/live/yK3QZkOZ6bE?feature=shared&t=3679). Though disappointed, Cecilia took pride in being Bijou’s sole knight... or so she thought. That pride was shattered when Bijou hired another knight, Ina, after Cecilia showed up late to a critical dungeon quest. (In her defense, she’d gotten lost again—a recurring issue that raised serious doubts about her aptitude for the job.) Still, as the self-proclaimed ["senpai"](https://www.youtube.com/live/yK3QZkOZ6bE?feature=shared&t=5511) knight, Cecilia consoled herself by believing her seniority gave her special importance.

Whether Cecilia’s dedication to the princess was purely out of loyalty or if there was something more behind her eagerness remained to be seen. For now, the Gem Princess’s quirky knight continued her duties with enthusiasm, however misguided they might be.
