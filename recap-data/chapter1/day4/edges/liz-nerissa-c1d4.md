<!-- title: Heartbroken -->

Elizabeth couldn’t believe her luck when Nerissa [invited](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=1397) her to join her on a journey to the Volcanic Dungeon. Without hesitation, she accepted. It was the perfect opportunity to finally spend some quality time alone with the enigmatic maiden in blue.

Before the adventure, Elizabeth decided to take a stroll around town with Raora. By chance, they stumbled upon Nerissa in the casino. Though their financial situations couldn’t be more different—Nerissa with her overflowing wealth and Elizabeth barely scraping together two digits—the scarlet knight decided to join her anyway. For Elizabeth, the amount didn’t matter. What mattered was the chance to bask in Nerissa’s presence.

As they played, Elizabeth found herself captivated by Nerissa’s elegance. She couldn’t help but admire every little thing about her—the way she moved, her radiant beauty—it was as if she were under a spell. But her daydream ended abruptly when she lost all her money in the game. Flustered and embarrassed, Elizabeth jokingly accused Nerissa of tricking her, though deep down, she couldn’t stay upset for long.

When the time came to conquer the Volcanic Dungeon, the two set off together. However, as they navigated the dungeon’s many challenges, Elizabeth’s suspicions only grew. Nerissa’s uncanny ability to avoid traps seemed too good to be true. Passing lasers effortlessly? Witch. Walking through fire unharmed? Witch. Catching Elizabeth mid-thought as she mentally accused her of being a witch? Definitely a [witch](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=3234).

Despite the accusations, Elizabeth’s thoughts kept drifting back to Nerissa. She was drawn to her, inexplicably and undeniably. The scarlet knight found herself unable to look away, observing every move Nerissa made with a mix of fascination and disbelief.

Elizabeth had fun—more fun than she’d had in a long time. She cherished every second spent with Nerissa, even with all the "witch" framing. And though Nerissa teased her, it felt like their bond was growing stronger. Elizabeth began to hope that maybe, just maybe, these feelings she couldn’t shake had real meaning, like birds with their trees, like bees with their flowers, like Romeo with his Juliet.

At one point, Elizabeth even tried to [trap](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=7576) Nerissa, all for the sake of sharing music with her. But Nerissa, with her usual wit and grace, escaped easily. Of course, Elizabeth blamed it on witchcraft, but she couldn’t deny the joy she felt during these moments.

But the day took a harsh turn when Elizabeth found herself in a duel against Gonathon. The knight demanded information about Mococo’s whereabouts, which Elizabeth refused to give. She emerged victorious, but Gonathon had an ace up his sleeve—Nerissa.

As a spectator, Nerissa had allied herself with Gonathon for protection against Mococo. He warned Elizabeth that if she didn’t cooperate, Nerissa would declare her hatred for her. Elizabeth put on a brave face, but when Nerissa coldly said the words, the scarlet knight crumbled.

Tears flowed as Elizabeth’s heart shattered. Everything they’d built, every shared moment, felt meaningless now. Nerissa’s rejection confirmed her worst fears—perhaps these feelings were all part of some cruel spell.

Distraught, Elizabeth wandered aimlessly, seeking comfort from [strangers](https://www.youtube.com/live/dCNrMstGc3I?feature=shared&t=8651) and throwing her remaining coins away at the casino. Yet nothing eased her pain. She was left poorer and emptier than before, her heart heavy with regret and longing.

For Elizabeth, the day ended in despair, but a small part of her still clung to hope. Maybe, just maybe, things could be mended. Perhaps the maiden in blue wasn’t a witch after all, but someone truly special—someone worth fighting for.
