<!-- title: Lottery Fiasco -->

Mococo was in deep. Her gambling addiction consumed her, and every morning, her first thought was the lottery—buying new tickets and eagerly checking if she'd struck gold from the previous batch. On the other side of this chaotic equation was Nerissa, freshly starting her internship at FaunaMart. Unfortunately for her, Mococo was her first customer, and the day was destined for disaster.

As usual, Mococo's morning quest led her straight to FaunaMart, where Nerissa was managing the counter in Fauna’s absence. Mococo eagerly requested her usual batch of lottery tickets, and Nerissa, still adjusting to her role, complied. However, her struggles with math led to a mistake in the initial calculation, which Mococo quickly corrected. Keep this detail in mind.

Sensing Nerissa’s inexperience, Mococo saw an opportunity. She tried to convince the blue-haired maiden that she had won a significant prize from the previous lottery batch, demanding her payout. Fortunately, Nerissa was cautious and messaged her boss, Fauna, to confirm. Besides, Nerissa didn’t even have enough coins to cover the supposed jackpot, which kept the money safe—for the moment. But Mococo wasn’t one to back down easily. Her claws came out—literally—and she began threatening Nerissa for not handing over her "winnings".

In a desperate attempt to resolve the escalating tension, Nerissa agreed to a duel. If Mococo won, Nerissa would pay her the money. What Nerissa hadn’t accounted for was how far Mococo’s hunger for money could push her. The duel was brief and decisive—Mococo emerged victorious. Nerissa, realizing she was outmatched, tried to escape, but Mococo’s feral determination drove her to chase Nerissa down, claws glinting with menace.

Cornered and exhausted, Nerissa reluctantly handed over 3,000 coins to Mococo, hoping it would end the madness. To her horror, Mococo immediately spent every last coin on more lottery tickets. But the chaos didn’t end there. Due to another calculation blunder, Nerissa accidentally gave Mococo 680 tickets instead of the requested 300. Mococo noticed the error but this time said nothing—why would she?

When Nerissa later discovered her mistake and confronted Mococo about it, the pup wasn’t having [any of it](https://www.youtube.com/live/5swK4fB2smo?feature=shared\&t=1602). She turned hostile, threatening to attack Nerissa if she tried to take back even a single ticket. Panicked, Nerissa sought protection with Gonathon and The Hot Pink One, exaggerating the situation by claiming Mococo had placed a 50,000-coin bounty on her head (a blatant lie). The two knights sprang into action, hunting down Mococo and eventually cornering her. The poor dog cried for help as she was trapped, the tables had turned.

Feeling guilty over how things had spiraled out of control—largely due to her own mistakes—Nerissa tried to [apologize](https://www.youtube.com/live/dRCvSHBTvSk?feature=shared\&t=17789) to Mococo. But the dog remained firm, refusing to return any tickets. Instead, she demanded a lawyer and insisted on settling the matter in court.

The drama at FaunaMart had turned into a full-blown fiasco, leaving Nerissa questioning her decision to take this internship and Mococo as determined as ever to cash in big—or at least make her case in front of a jury.
