<!-- title: Little Gnome Boy -->

Married life had proven to be a battlefield for Gonathon. Ever since tying the knot with Jyonathan, his days had been spent fending off external threats—namely other so-called "heroes" attempting to steal his beloved away. And today was no different. A new challenger had entered the fray.

Gura wasn’t usually one to meddle in other people’s affairs. She preferred keeping to herself, letting the world move on without her interference. Yet, for some inexplicable reason, every time she crossed paths with Jyonathan, an itch would surface—an urge to mess with the blonde maiden.

And Jyonathan? She didn’t mind one bit. In fact, she relished Gura’s mischievous antics, engaging in the playful back-and-forth with just as much enthusiasm.

For Gonathon, this dynamic was nothing short of a waking nightmare.

The two troublemakers flirted—implicitly, but just enough to fuel [misunderstandings](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=11832). Gura’s way with words was already vague enough to raise eyebrows, but Jyonathan didn’t hesitate to lean in, adding fuel to the fire. Each message, each interaction, was a fresh stab to the poor knight’s sanity.

From secretive, suggestive phone calls to planning spontaneous outings behind Gonathon’s back (sometimes with, sometimes without his reluctant approval), the duo seemed hellbent on testing the knight’s patience. At one point, they even conspired against him, theorizing that Gonathon was carrying some sort of disease just because of his fondness for [cheese](https://www.youtube.com/live/72SJQRQ7qi0?feature=shared&t=8820), spreading it to everyone around him like a plague-ridden rat.

Was it all in good fun? Probably. But for Gonathon, it was an ordeal.

Somewhere along the way, though, an odd camaraderie formed between the unlikely trio. Beneath the layers of teasing and chaos, Gura and Gonathon found common ground—or at least enough of it to compare the length and girth of their hats.
