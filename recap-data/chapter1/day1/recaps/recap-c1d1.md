## Day 1: Welcome to Libestal

And so the journey begins. Summoned to the fantastical _Kingdom of Libestal_ by its King, 19 heroes, each with their unique quirks, are tasked with a vital mission: to combat the looming threat known as The Stains. Yet, this new reality is not without its complications. Each of them, stripped of their memories, awoke with no recollection of their past lives, leaving them to navigate this strange world as strangers even to themselves.

Chaos and confusion ruled the day, which was to be expected. The girls were divided into four distinct guilds, each representing a unique philosophy:

- **Jade Sword:** The beacon of the righteous and loyal, where great threats are faced with even greater courage
- **Cerulean Cup:** The sanctum of healing, where the spirit of empathy and devotion thrives.
- **Amber Coin:** The home for glory-seekers with ambition and vision, where even the closest allies become fiercest rivals.
- **Scarlet Wand:** The haven for the curious, where knowledge and creativity are valued above all.

Tasked and trusted by the king, the heroes set out to acclimate to their new world. They learned about its intricate systems, including forming parties, using telepathic devices for communication, undertaking quests to earn coins, and more. Central to their roles were the unique weapons bestowed upon them. Each weapon possessed a special ability, or _Revelation_, tied exclusively to its wielderâ€”a power as mysterious as it was significant.

The day's primary mission led them to the _Underworld Dungeon_, a foreboding place tied to the essence of death. Success in conquering the dungeon promised a reward of profound value: the restoration of fragments of their lost memories.

However, this was far from the day's only story. The heroes summoned by the king proved to be anything but ordinary. Beyond the main quest, countless shenanigans unfolded, along with budding relationships and unexpected narratives. For every grand objective, there were personal moments of humor, mischief, and discovery.
