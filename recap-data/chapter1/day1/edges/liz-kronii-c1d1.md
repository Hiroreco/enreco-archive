<!-- title: Red and Blue -->

It wasn’t long before a conflict—if you could even call it that—erupted in the Kingdom between two of Libestal's most fiery personalities: Tam Gandr, the self-proclaimed future "Queen" of Libestal, and Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame, a former Queen in her past life.

The tension sparked during an investigation led by Gonathon G of Jyon Watson, the would-be king-slayer. Elizabeth, a member of the same guild as Jyon, wasn’t about to let her guildmate be accused without a defense (even if Jyon had plotted to kill the King). On the other side, Tam wasn’t about to let anyone disrespect her guildmate Gonathon, setting the stage for a dramatic clash of wills.

What followed was a verbal showdown—sharp words flying between them, though much of it boiled down to them repeatedly telling the other to [shut up](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared\&t=5985). Neither backed down, but the feud escalated when Elizabeth claimed to be part of Amber Coin, a guild Tam utterly [despised](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared\&t=5964) (for some odd reason). For Tam, this was confirmation: Elizabeth was her enemy. Tam wasted no time mocking Elizabeth’s supposed allegiance to Amber Coin, and every subsequent interaction between them became a battle of petty exchanges.

Things reached a boiling point when Tam discovered Elizabeth was, in fact, a member of Jade Sword. This revelation didn’t defuse the situation; instead, Tam branded Elizabeth a compulsive [liar](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared\&t=7706) and kept her guard up at all times.

It seemed clear: these two weren’t about to reconcile anytime soon. Their rivalry had just begun, and the Kingdom of Libestal would undoubtedly bear witness to more clashes between the self-assured would-be Queen and the regal knight of fire.
