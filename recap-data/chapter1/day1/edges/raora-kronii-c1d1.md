<!-- title: Say my name -->

The (self-proclaimed) Libestian Queen was already making a name for herself across the kingdom. She had gathered loyal followers, asserted her dominance, and made others bow whenever they stood in her presence.

It was only natural—after all, she was perfect. Brimming with empathy and compassion, she never let anything get under her skin, always maintaining her mature composure throughout the day… that was, until a certain pink cat appeared.

Never had Tam imagined that someone could get on her nerves so much simply by mispronouncing her name—albeit, repeatedly. But this wasn’t just any pink cat. Upon learning that Tam was supposedly the "Queen" of the kingdom, Raora wasted no time in claiming the title for herself, declaring that she was the true queen and that Tam was merely second in line. Tam, of course, refused to back down, firing back that she was the actual queen, while Raora was just an impostor.

What followed was a conversation that could only be described as something straight out of a playground argument—two individuals, going back and forth, each trying to one-up the other in their imaginary rule. The only problem? These were fully grown adult women.

Raora, however, wasn’t just playing around—she was serious. She would do whatever it took to prove she was the true queen. But Tam? She could only shake her head and brush the whole thing off, thinking to herself, "What the heck is wrong with this person?"
