<!-- title: Catlady -->

Raora, affectionately known as the "beeg cat" of the group, quickly became a favorite of Shakira, who clearly had a soft spot for cats. From the moment they met, Shakira went out of her way to ensure Raora was comfortable and cared for.

Her attentiveness was unwavering—when Raora went missing, Shakira was the first to notice. Without hesitation, she rallied everyone to search for [her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izEX6XKyApQ\&t=3874s). On another ocassion, when Shakira found Raora on her own after wandering around on her lonesome herself, she was [overjoyed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izEX6XKyApQ\&t=4707s), like an owner finding their lost pet.

Throughout the day, the two shared countless moments together, forming a bond that felt natural and heartwarming amidst the chaos. They chatted about various topics, laughed, and worked together to build up their guild base. Shakira seemed intent on keeping Raora company at all [times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izEX6XKyApQ\&t=6381s), treating her with the same affection one might give to a beloved pet.

Before the day ended, Shakira called out to Raora one last time to say [goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izEX6XKyApQ\&t=13636s)—like a caring cat owner bidding farewell before heading off to work. It was a sweet and wholesome connection, a refreshing contrast to the madness unfolding around them.
