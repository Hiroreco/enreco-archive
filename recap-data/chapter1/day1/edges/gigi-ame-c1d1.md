<!-- title: King Killer -->

Gonathon was a thorn in Jyon Watson's side for most of the day. The orange knight had discovered Jyon's plan to assassinate the King, a plot that Gonathon couldn’t tolerate in good conscience. Every time he encountered the blonde maiden, he would shout accusations and cause a scene, determined to expose her treachery to the rest of the kingdom.

The others, however, were far less invested. Many found the interactions between the two amusing—watching Gonathon chase Jyon around like an overzealous guard dog. Most of them, save for Elizabeth, didn’t care much for the King anyway.

Eventually, Jyon seemed to tire of the relentless pursuit and finally decided to confront her pursuer. She stopped and calmly explained her reasoning for wanting to take down the King.

According to her, the King was corrupted and bore a Stain (on his pants, no less) and was deceiving everyone into serving him for his own nefarious purposes. However, her claims were offered without evidence, sources, or any tangible proof... so it made perfect sense for Gonathon to believe her without question. Whether it was her striking beauty or her confident delivery that swayed him, the knight cast aside all of his earlier accusations.

Swearing allegiance to her cause, Gonathon vowed to help Jyon in her endeavors, with the goal of saving the King.
