<!-- title: Friends (?) -->

You put a rat and an owl in the same room, and it’s only a matter of time before the owl starts picking on the rat. That was precisely what happened between Three and Bae on their first day. Three wasn’t particularly kind to her newfound companion—teasing her, calling her crazy—and Bae knew all too well that she was being picked on.

But that dynamic didn’t last long. In a chaotic fantasy kingdom filled with equally chaotic inhabitants, survival demanded teamwork. It wasn’t long before Bae and Three put their differences aside to face the day’s challenges together. From quests to learning the kingdom’s peculiar mechanics, the two stuck together, becoming unlikely allies.

Their teamwork extended to investigating the arrival of the Hot Pink One. After some awkward introductions and a hilariously confusing debate over whether the Hot Pink One’s weapon was a halo or a set of shurikens, Bae and Three came to a unanimous conclusion: she was too much trouble.

Deciding against recruiting her, they [left her](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=6319) to her eccentricities. Perhaps bringing the town loony into their guild would have done more harm than good.
