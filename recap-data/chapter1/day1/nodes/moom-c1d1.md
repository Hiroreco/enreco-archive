_Mumei_ woke up in the white box, and just like everyone else, she... didn't lose her memories? Wait, hold on, something isn't right—let's fix that real quick. _[Bang](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=520)_. A swift head-to-table collision later. Whoa, what happened? Where am I? The maiden in brown's reaction upon waking up in the white box was the same as everyone else's: confused, dazed, and completely lost.

It was very loud there; the noise from all the talking was overwhelming, but our subject, ever the quiet observer, simply wandered around, tossing out random [one-liners](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=2327) at people. For some reason, though, she saved most of her jabs for _Peasant The Bae_. No one knew why—probably not even herself.

And as she wandered around, she saw how everyone was trying to break one particular block. Wanting to be helpful, the brown maiden came over to offer a hand. And then...

Next thing we know, our hero had somehow skipped ahead and was already fighting the Stain King. [Alone](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=2768). At the very least, there weren't any voices yammering around her anymore. During the battle, she revealed her weapon of choice: a [dagger](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=2940). When she activated its Revelation, it unleashed a flurry of rapid slashes towards the targeted enemy. Afterward, she had a chat with the guild masters and the King, finding herself amused by the Amber Coin guild master's [accent](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=2987). Coincidentally, she was sorted into the _Amber Coin_ [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=3306).

When she first met up with her guildmates, after calling Bae a weirdo, Mumei introduced herself as _Cleopatra Eisenhower Da Vinci The Great III_. Bae shortened it to _Three_, for obvious reasons. Later, at the quest board, Three’s eyes lit up when she saw someone riding a [horse](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=3947). From that moment on, she was all about the horses. She enjoyed herself [way](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?t=4951s) too much, riding around like a knight from some chaotic medieval fair. Unfortunately for everyone else, her idea of fun also included using her steed as a [battering ram](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=5259).

Although they started off rocky, Mumei and Bae ended up sticking together for most of the day. Sure, they bickered and called each other names, but somewhere along the way, a weird little friendship formed (see [Bae-Three: Friends(?)](#edge:bae-moom)).

By the end of the day, Three and her guildmates conquered the _Underworld Dungeon_ and recovered _[Mori Calliope’s](https://www.youtube.com/live/vuij6YTMIzw?feature=shared&t=9831)_ memories. Her start was odd indeed, but throughout the day she had fun nonetheless. Here’s hoping things stay fun—and that her love for trampling people with horses doesn’t get her in too much trouble.
