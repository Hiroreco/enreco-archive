Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame, once the mighty queen of the Bloodflame Kingdom, awoke in the fantastical kingdom of Libestal with no memory of her past life. Confusion was inevitable, but within her burned an unyielding fire—a deep sense of justice and a natural instinct to protect the weak.

It was no surprise, then, that she was placed in the [Jade Sword](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?si=wjA60_hrPgwaKHhO&t=3519), the guild known as the beacon of righteousness and loyalty.

Elizabeth wielded a massive claymore named Thorn, its fiery scarlet hue reflecting her unbreakable spirit. The sheer size of the blade made Shakira feel a tad self-conscious about her own [weapon](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?si=C9BFKwM0cwgfjdSw&t=3987), but Elizabeth, ever the knight, reassured her that size didn’t matter—it’s how you wield it. She was, after all, a symbol of knighthood: diligent, kind, and beloved by all.

Or so it should have been.

Reality painted a different picture. Instead of a tale of a noble knight, Elizabeth's first day became a comedy of errors. She was run over by horses, got [lost](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?si=uOp34AwQFe8CymWf&t=8087) repeatedly (even while searching for her own guild), left by her lonesome after everyone promised her a duel, and was teased endlessly for being mistaken as a member of [Amber Coin](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?si=yttis-Jdo0fiakRM&t=7205).

The cherry on top? She was branded a harlot simply for hushing the gums of the Hot Pink One, albeit it was without consent (see [Elizabeth-Tam: Red and Blue](#edge:liz-kronii)). During all this, her internal music seemed to change with the situation, as if her life were a melodramatic play.

Despite the chaos, Elizabeth found solace in her guildmates, with whom she felt an undeniable connection. Perhaps her nature was to be kind, to stand for the weak, no matter the mishaps. She felt this strongly with the two doggos (see [Elizabeth-Mococo: By Your Side](#edge:mococo-liz)).

By the end of the day, alongside Gonathon G and NinoIna—both members of Cerulean Cup—Elizabeth conquered the _Underworld Dungeon_, reclaiming the lost memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/2qiX7084obE?feature=shared&t=12428). It marked not just the end of her chaotic first day but the beginning of her journey in this strange new world.
