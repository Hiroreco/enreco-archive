The first thing *Fauna* noticed upon waking in the white box was how absurdly [bright](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=8uBOHktGG-Kzh9WB&t=247) it was, following up with a complaint about how loud everyone’s voices were. Complaining seemed like the logical first step when you’ve lost all your memories, right?

Unlike the other heroes, though, Fauna remained calm, collected, and entirely in control. It was as if she had done this before, casually remarking that the world reminded her of ["Minecraft"](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=s__Wo-nNYnk4VH3F&t=1682). Which explained her immediate urge to chop down a lone tree when she spotted one; it wasn’t just nostalgia—it was fueled by her OCD.

During the battle with the *Stain King*, Fauna’s weapon made its debut: a wand topped with a [golden apple](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=c8218mEL2pzXTcr2&t=3173). Its *Revelation*—*"Instant Tipi,"* as she named it—summoned a magical tipi-like dome that trapped enemies. More importantly, the wand also functioned as a healing tool, making Fauna the only one capable of providing support.

In a brief exchange with the guildmasters, she mimicked the *Amber Coin* guildmaster’s accent, calling it "British," and, knowing how "good" Fauna is at her accents, the voices in her head went into an immediate state of [panic](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=0_DR3pQaTV-Eefyw&t=3234). She was eventually sorted into the *Scarlet Wand* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=-WFwPJ36yVIN8B7Z&t=3441).

After entering the new world, Fauna began familiarizing herself with her surroundings. While completing a quest to slay Stains, Fauna discovered something intriguing—she earned money for each Stain defeated. The realization amused her, sparking a newfound joy.

The Stains were no longer just enemies to vanquish for the greater good—they were a source of [income](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=Ewua3iV9CrElQap3&t=5008). With dollar signs in her eyes, Fauna’s motivation shifted ever so slightly as she continued questing with her guildmates.

Continuing on, in a memorable moment involving *Shakira*, the lady in orange challenged *Gura* to float on water, given that she had a shark tail. Gura gave it a go and promptly drowned. Fauna, observing the entire fiasco, didn’t lift a finger to help (she did, but only after Gura drowned). She did feel pretty guilty about her guildmate, however, because right after Gura cried out, *"HEALER? WHERE’S MY HEAL?"* Holding the support title, Fauna felt it was her responsibility to provide a sincere apology, and so she replied:

Later, Fauna teamed up with her guildmates, Gura and Cecilia, to conquer the *Underworld Dungeon*, where they recovered memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=-eUxCKiyxKEaV8hA&t=9484). The trio then explored the world further, buying "gacha boxes" along the way. Gura pulled a ridiculously long, pointy hat, prompting Fauna to quip that she looked like a [garden gnome](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=k2bJ5eR6M8O7z9M6&t=10304).

The two later dueled, with Fauna emerging victorious—and promptly extorting Gura for some loot, as any good guildmate [would](https://www.youtube.com/live/VrLNA0SjYN8?si=xCvDCmma03qWhWhk&t=11073). Their next adventure led them to a casino, where Fauna’s love of money truly shone. Betting everything on the color green—the color of money—she won a few rounds but lost just as many. Still, the thrill of the gamble fueled her, and despite her questionable behavior for a hero, she couldn’t get enough.

After a long day of questing and gambling her life away, Fauna decided to call it a night. But something had awoken within her. It wasn’t the thrill of saving the world or helping people—it was the joy of money. Who knows where this newfound passion will lead her? Perhaps… a business empire?
