_The maiden in blue_ woke up in a peculiar white box, her first thought fixated on why everything—her hands, the world, even the people—appeared so square and pixelated. She roamed around asking anyone and everyone a barrage of questions: _"Is your name Kiara? What are you doing in the corner? The server closed? What does that mean?"_ Her confusion was palpable, and it became evident that she couldn’t even recall her own name.

This changed when she crossed paths with Gonathon G, who suggested the title _'The Azure Maiden'_ because of her fondness for blue. While Kronii found it poetic, she thought it was a bit too long. Gonathon shortened it to _'Tam,'_ and Kronii, in her own flair, appended _Gandr_. Thus, her new identity was born—_Tam Gandr_.

When summoned by the King alongside the other heroes, Tam felt a unique sense of destiny. Unlike the rest, she was convinced that the King’s fateful words, "Will you—" were the prelude to a royal proposal. Naturally, this meant she was destined to be his _Queen_ (see [Tam-King: Guess I'm Queen now](#edge:kronii-king-of-libestal)).

Brimming with this belief, she shared her newfound 'truth' with _Peasant the Bae_, who became awestruck at the honor of standing in the presence of [royalty](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=1333).

During the battle with the _Stain King_, Tam unsheathed her weapons: a pair of dual-wielding blades shaped like [clock hands](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=2968), which, upon activation, unleashed a relentless flurry of attacks. She was then sorted into the _Cerulean Cup_ guild.

Tam’s presence in Cerulean Cup quickly established her as a dominant figure, with her charisma and aura of confidence naturally earning her respect as the guild leader. This was evident during the first major conflict in the kingdom, a heated recruitment battle between _Cerulean Cup and Amber Coin_ over _the Hot Pink One_.

Tam’s empathetic nature shone as she leveraged her remarkable power of persuasion—a skill she had already demonstrated while inspiring a [Libestan child](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=5140). It was no surprise when the Hot Pink One eventually succumbed to her words, sealed with Tam’s unforgettable declaration:

["Nobody wants you except us"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=6213)

As the day progressed, Tam found herself caught in various shenanigans. Yet, she always managed to handle situations with an air of maturity. When Gonathon was interrogated by Elizabeth, Tam intervened, _calmly_ defusing the tension (see [Elizabeth-Tam: Red and Blue](#edge:liz-kronii)).

By the day's end, Tam joined the Hot Pink One and Mori Calliope in the _Underworld Dungeon_, where they recovered fragments of their lost [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/zgioohaY0m4?feature=shared&t=11965). It was a chaotic, exhausting day for Tam, filled with triumphs, conflicts, and laughter. She gained devoted followers who pledged their unwavering loyalty (see [Gonathon-Tam: You're the Queen!](#edge:gigi-kronii)).

But above all, she found solace in the simple yet profound comfort of having a name—_Tam_. Though it was given impulsively by Gonathon, it resonated with her, becoming a cherished part of her identity. To Tam, that name was more than just a label; it was a symbol of her newfound self, one she would carry and treasure throughout the rest of her journey.

As the kingdom settled into quiet, Tam yearned for a peaceful night’s sleep. Surely, nothing else would trouble her now. Surely... (see [Raora-Tam: Say my name](#edge:raora-kronii)).
