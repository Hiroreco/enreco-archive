The lady in pink's introduction to the fantasy world was, well, a little different from the others. She awoke in the mysterious white box by herself, spoke with the king by herself, and even faced the Stain King... [by herself.](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rk7nZ91vme4?si=SR-vjc02WKIL4nUb&t=1084)

An odd and grueling start it was, but the isolation didn’t last long. Once she entered the Kingdom of Libestal, her presence made an immediate impact, transforming her lonely beginning into something much more dynamic.

After her exhausting and painful battle with the Stain King, she was officially sorted into the Cerulean Cup. Shortly after, she had her first encounter with the lively members of Amber Coin. That’s when _Shakira_, ever the opportunist, swooped in and attempted to recruit the pink one to her guild instead.

Little did Shakira know, the pink one was no simpleton. She was someone loyal to her friends and true to the ideals of empathy, someone who would never betray her guild, no matter what. It was her destiny to be of the Cerulean Cup, and no forces could ever change that... She accepted Shakira's invitation without a second thought.

This betrayal was short-lived, however. When the rest of Cerulean Cup arrived to retrieve their wayward guildmate, she eventually returned to her proper guild, albeit reluctantly. After showcasing her unique Revelation, _Light and Darkness_, which some dubbed similar to a [fart](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rk7nZ91vme4?si=uFnTUFLfBm36VZS-&t=2668), she threw herself into the day’s activities. Completing quests, enduring [hushed gums](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rk7nZ91vme4?si=5AhwIkLOBX3MgfA2&t=4480), and earning her fair share of [eyebrow-raising](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rk7nZ91vme4?si=5jr_c9OW9ds8maMQ&t=5777) remarks.

Her journey culminated in the group’s venture into the _Underworld Dungeon_, where she recovered the memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rk7nZ91vme4?feature=shared&t=8690), and also where she was first nicknamed [Hot Pink One](https://www.youtube.com/live/Rk7nZ91vme4?si=PZSB2R7NaSzFRo_b&t=7601).

It was a whirlwind of a day for the maiden, filled with ups, downs, and plenty of chaos. But through it all, she had fun, marking the vibrant beginning of the Hot Pink One’s journey.
