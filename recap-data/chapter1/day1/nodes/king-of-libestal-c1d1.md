<!-- title: King of Libestal -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

The King of Libestal was the one who had summoned all the adventurers to this kingdom. He described it as a desperate act, a final hope, for his kingdom and its people stood on the brink of ruin. A calamity known as the Stains—a corrupted force threatening to consume the world—was closing in. And so, he summoned these nineteen heroes, placing his faith in them as the kingdom’s saviors, holding great hopes that they would rise to the occasion and fend off the terrible fate looming ahead.

After the heroes successfully defended the kingdom from the first wave of corruption, the King took notice of the strange power they possessed—Revelation.

It was unlike anything he had seen before, and he believed it to be the key to defeating the Stains once and for all. With this newfound hope, he called upon the heroes, asking them to lend their strength, to embark on a long and arduous journey, and ultimately, to save the world. He entrusted the four guild leaders with guiding them, allowing them to explain their purpose and direction. And in doing so, he provided the heroes with a place to call home—where they would forge bonds, grow stronger, and prepare for the enigmatic journey ahead.
