There are many different ways a person may get transported to another world. They might get hit by a truck, get hit by a train, or basically get hit by any moving vehicle. While many heroes claimed to have arrived through these methods, _Koseki Bijou's_ tale stood out. She was crushed by a giant Moai statue, accompanied by multiple _vine boom sound effects_.

Odd as it was, Bijou managed to arrive in the same mysterious white box as the others—that was what mattered.

Thanks to something many referred to as a 'stream overlay,' she knew her name was [Koseki Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=381). Being the curious little gem she is, she wasted no time running around asking the important questions—like whether Nerissa laid eggs, if Fauna was her mom, or if _Shiori_ was her [lover](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=972). You know, totally normal, first-day-in-another-world stuff. She also kept asking people to comment on her [feet](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=2669).

During the fight with the Stain King, Bijou showed off her weapon of choice: [two dazzling gems](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=3377) that launched an endless array of radiant gemstones at their foes. After that, she got sorted into the _Cerulean Cup_ guild, joining the ranks of other not-so-normal heroes.

Her journey officially began in classic Bijou fashion—with a mix-up. She somehow—though not deliberately—joined the [wrong](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=4058) party at first, but it was quickly resolved. While working on a quest outside the kingdom, she discovered a [sheep](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=4470) she grew strangely attached to and also developed an odd fondness for the world’s [rocks](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=5204). She hesitated to mine them, even though it was part of her task as she felt an emotional connection to them.

Bijou later played a key role in the _Hot Pink One_ incident, being the first to find her and calling in the rest of the guild for [support](https://www.youtube.com/live/OTmQwttr1Aw?feature=shared&t=5851). Despite her contributions, Bijou secretly claimed to be an _undercover agent of evil_, plotting to overthrow the system someday. She even went so far as to offer her assistance to Jyon Watson in assassinating the King, proving she’s more unpredictable than the King might have anticipated.

As her day continued, Bijou eventually teamed up with Nerissa, the two doggos, and later, Raora, to take on the _Underworld Dungeon_. Amidst plenty of chaos and [screaming](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fr6yMByDTIs?feature=shared&t=3318v), they managed to recover [Mori Calliope’s](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fr6yMByDTIs?feature=shared&t=4986) memories. But Bijou’s day didn’t end there.

True to her adventurous spirit—or questionable priorities—she decided to gamble all her money. Unsurprisingly, she lost [60%](https://www.youtube.com/live/Fr6yMByDTIs?feature=shared&t=7354) of it, but in her words, "99% of gamblers quit before they lose (?)," she persevered. Eventually, her luck turned around, and she won it all back.

Her actions, however, may have raised some eyebrows among the voices in her head. After all, one of the supposed heroes of the realm turned out to be a gambling enthusiast who openly planned to overthrow the King who trusted them so.

But despite her chaotic tendencies, Bijou’s day was eventful, and whatever lies ahead, her journey is sure to be as unpredictable as she is. Whether her mischievous tendencies would lead to any kind of _corruption_ remained to be seen.

Oh, and one more thing, wooden shovel.
