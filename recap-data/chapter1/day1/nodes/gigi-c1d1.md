Only minutes after waking up in the mysterious white box, the individual clad in orange proclaimed a new identity: _Gonathon with a G_, or simply Gonathon G, a knight with medieval flair, speaking in a manner that added a peculiar charm to the group's already chaotic dynamic. Like everyone else, they were completely clueless about the strange fantasy world they had been summoned to.

An important detail about Gonathon: _he_ (at least at the time) identified as a knight, and his weapon of choice was a pair of metal fists, or the [Gremlin Grenade](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?feature=shared&t=3085), which unleashed devastating explosions when activated.

Gonathon was sorted into the Cerulean Cup guild, known for its spirit of empathy, along with four other members. However, the harmonious image didn’t last long. Tensions flared when their rival guild, the Amber Coin, attempted to [kidnap](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?si=xE2vDkSE0e1yKT_w&t=5565) one of Cerulean Cup’s own, the so-called Hot Pink One. This act of aggression led the Cerulean Cup members to unanimously declare Amber Coin as their worst enemy. Fortunately, our empaths eventually managed to retrieve their guildmate.

Gonathon G, though brave, wore his heart on his sleeve. His emotions ran high, and he was easily affected by the words and actions of others. For instance, he couldn’t help but cause a commotion every time he encountered Jyon Watson, the accused King Killer (see [Gonathon-Jyon: King Killer](#edge:gigi-ame)).

He also grew visibly agitated when Elizabeth, one of Jade Sword's members, referred to him as ["the loud one"](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?si=xoXIP9Ni9qdFv1mJ&t=9070). And crying? Well, Gonathon did that often, for just about any reason. Whether it was Liz ["hushing the gums"](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?si=uOA9eA5-H_wGz8oT&t=7910) of the Hot Pink One, insulting his [long-forgotten mother](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?si=m_ePVuEIKMxJr459&t=6031), or even refusing to share her melons, Gonathon’s tears flowed freely.

Gonathon's first day wasn’t entirely marked by screams and tears. Many of the people he encountered treated him kindly, especially his guildmates. One person, however, stood out above all the rest. She wasn’t just any ordinary individual—she was destined to become the next Queen of this new kingdom. Moved by a sense of honor and purpose, Gonathon vowed his loyalty to her (see [Gonathon-Tam: You're the Queen!](#edge:gigi-kronii)).

Eventually, alongside Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame and NinoIna, he ventured into the _Underworld Dungeon_. Together, they recovered memories tied to [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/y9KKa_k2VTU?feature=shared&t=12343), taking their first steps in unraveling the mysteries of their fragmented pasts.
