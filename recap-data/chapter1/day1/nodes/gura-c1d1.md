_"I want to punch this one. I don't know why, I just have an urge,"_ was one of the first things _Gura_ said after waking up in the white room. The target? A blonde maiden named [Jyon Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=Y5cIDsVzAWQ_KLyt&t=535). It felt like there was unresolved tension between them—despite Gura not remembering anything about her past. Or maybe she was just feeling extra sassy, later casually calling Tam a dumbass when addressing her [name](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=DZTu5_2xTqaUWn3X&t=2562).

During the battle with the Stain King, Gura’s weapon—[a trident](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=iOr1m3bizOsFkBs6&t=3078)—was revealed. When she activated its Revelation, it summoned a wave of water that pushed back enemies. After the battle, she was sorted into the _Scarlet Wand_ [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=0VHccAIdMWhD0QQf&t=3413).

And so, Gura’s journey began. Like everyone else, her first task was figuring out this strange new world. She started doing quests with her guildmates but was confused most of the time—thanks to her [shork brain](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=6UmKNJggTOPF7KXR&t=5172). All sass, zero intelligence. Luckily, her guildmates included _Nerissa, Fauna, Shiori, and Cecilia_, who lived up to the Scarlet Wand's reputation for being smart. They carried her through most challenges.

Not everything went smoothly, though. She got involved in a [hit-and-run](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=SyZDDDTLhI0pvuNb&t=5252) incident with _Cleopatra Eisenhower Da Vinci The Great III_ and, in another instance, drowned after accepting Shakira’s challenge to float on water. Yes, despite her shark-like features and literal tail, she somehow managed to drown.

Later, Gura teamed up with Fauna and Cecilia to tackle the _Underworld Dungeon_. During their conquest, Gura got an unexpected call from [Jyon Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=Zjtfn-It4RAxI-V-&t=7423), claiming to represent the 'Libestonian Charity.' Predictably, Gura saw through the scam and shut it down immediately. The trio conquered the dungeon, recovering memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=Jtp8XzHA_FLV9Wi9&t=9383), though not without some [screaming](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=Zst9EdhSWxT2Oh3-&t=7627) along the way.

Their day didn’t end there. The group continued exploring the world, with one highlight being the _gacha boxes_. Gura scored a ridiculous, long, pointy red velvet hat and proudly declared herself _The Appointed Point_.

The almighty Appointed Point didn’t stay mighty for long, as Fauna promptly beat her up and extorted some [loot](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJtapc2_7ok?si=YkwgWZsNZ_jUp72e&t=10970). Turns out, the hat didn’t boost her strength—or intelligence.

Finally, the three of them wrapped up their day at the casino. While Fauna and Cecilia made decent profits, Gura went bankrupt—she lost so much money she couldn't feel her legs anymore. Again, the hat offered no perks. Despite that, she had a blast and was excited for whatever adventures lay ahead.
