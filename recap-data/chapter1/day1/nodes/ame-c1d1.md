_The blonde maiden_ awoke in the mysterious white box, completely disoriented. Questions flooded her mind:

> Am I dead? Am I in limbo? Why do these people have buttons floating over their heads?

But those concerns were secondary. The real issue? She had no memory of anything, not even her own name. Her first interaction was with a sharky girl, who, to her observation, had a questionable [smell](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=552). The people around her seemed equally bizarre. Confused and overwhelmed, the blonde tried to break out, but escape was impossible.

She soon discovered that she had been summoned by a king to save the kingdom. Save it? Not her style. Instead, she had a different plan: take over the kingdom. Revelation? No thanks—she was more about [revolution](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=2486). Despite overhearing murmurs from others, including _Gonathon_, about her rebellious plans, the blonde was undeterred. Her determination to overthrow the King was clear, evident in how she brushed off any explanations from the guild masters and focused on her singular goal.

During the battle with the Stain King, Ame—who introduced herself as [Jyon Watson](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=2554)—revealed her weapon: a [magnifying glass](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=3055). Its Revelation is a bonk on the enemy’s head. Cute, but not exactly earth-shattering. After the battle, she was sorted into the _Jade Sword_ [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=3328)—a group dedicated to protecting the King. Oh, the irony.

Jyon's journey to overthrow the kingdom officially began. True to her rebellious nature, she quickly made a name for herself by riding her horse into random [bystanders](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=3966). Still, even revolutionaries need to learn the ropes. Jyon begrudgingly completed quests and figured out how the world worked, all while having chaotic run-ins with [others](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUCfCWOj-1w?feature=shared&t=5214). One notable incident involved Gonathon making a scene after spotting her—but, thanks to her guildmates, she was able to slither out of trouble.

Then came the moment Jyon had been waiting for: her attempt to assassinate the King. She sneaked her way into the kingdom's castle, stealthily approached the King, and carefully lined up her strike.

With a dramatic flourish, she activated her Revelation, bonking the King on the head with her magnifying glass. She followed up with a flurry of attacks using her stone sword and even dug a hole beneath him with a pickaxe. The King was surely gone now...

Actually, none of her attacks worked. Defeated but undeterred, she vowed to return for vengeance.

Later, Gonathon confronted her again. This time, Jyon managed to persuade him, spinning a tale that convinced him to let her go (see [Gonathon-Jyon: King Killer](#edge:gigi-ame)). With that hurdle cleared, she capped off her day with a prank call to Gura, claiming to represent the "Libestonian Charity." Unsurprisingly, Gura wasn’t fooled and rejected her scam.

Satisfied with the chaos she’d caused, Jyon called it a day.
