_Cecilia_, the very durable _automaton_, was minding her own business when, out of nowhere, a grand piano fell on her, knocking her out instantly. Don’t you just hate it when random pianos fall from the sky—indoors, no less?

Anyway, upon waking up in the mysterious white box, Cecilia was immediately greeted by Shakira, who asked if she spoke _German_, in German: "Ach san Sie auch Deitsch?" To her surprise, Cecilia did, and the two struck up a hearty [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=781). It was a strange way to start, but oddly comforting amid the chaos. Like everyone else, Cecilia had no memory of her past—aside from knowing she liked [pizza](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=1090).

During the battle with the _Stain King_, Cecilia’s role was... questionable. She didn’t actually fight but justified her idleness by claiming to be "standing by as medic." Shiori also opted out of fighting; the difference? She didn't even have an excuse.

For heroes summoned to save a kingdom, their approach was, well, unconventional. Eventually, Cecilia revealed her weapon: [a spear](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=3060). Upon activating its _Revelation_, it unleashed a flurry of rapid jabs against the enemy. She, like her 'watchmate' Shiori, was sorted into the _Scarlet Wand_ [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared&t=3347).

Cecilia’s adventure officially began with great enthusiasm, especially after donning the [Libestal Cloak](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=3483). She started tackling quests with her guildmates, learning the basics of the world: communication devices, forming parties, and more.

Later, Cecilia teamed up with _Gura and Fauna_ to take on the _Underworld Dungeon_. She was the most animated, reacting dramatically to every [twist and turn](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=8277) on their journey. Together, they conquered the dungeon and unlocked the memories of _[Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/SAdndMvNK98?feature=shared&t=9328)_. Afterward, the trio decided to hang out in the kingdom, exploring buildings, dueling, and purchasing "gacha boxes." Gura’s prize—a ridiculously long hat—left Cecilia in fits of laughter.

Their day didn’t end there. They ventured into a casino to test their luck. Cecilia and Fauna both bet on green (naturally, as green ladies). Cecilia faced some losses but managed to win back her money in the end—unlike Gura, who lost everything. Despite the ups and downs, Cecilia wrapped up her day feeling fulfilled, looking forward to more adventures with her guildmates, and hoping the fun would continue.
