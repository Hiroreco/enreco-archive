*Raora* awoke in the white box and, true to her nature, did what any self-respecting big cat might do: she [lashed out](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=847) at a few unfortunate souls and, oddly enough, offered comfort to a lost dog.

The image of a fearsome panther only lasted for a moment, though, as not too long after, she was very content being doted on, purring as others [pet her](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=1645). Like everyone else summoned into this world, she had no recollection of her past. When *Bijou* introduced herself, Raora followed suit, though Bijou struggled to pronounce her name, instead calling her [Waowa](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=2777).

During the confrontation with the Stain King, Raora’s prowess came to light. Her weapon of choice was a pair of sleek [white claws](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=3272). Upon activating their Revelation, she moved with the swiftness and agility of a panther, teleporting around her enemy and delivering a flurry of slashes. After the battle, Raora was assigned to the *Amber Coin* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=3543).

Within the guild, Raora was treated much like a cherished pet. Her guildmates found her endearing, caring for her attentively and often searching for her when she [wandered off](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=3929). *Shakira*, in particular, took it upon herself to ensure Raora’s comfort and well-being (see [Shakira-Raora: Big Pink Cat](#edge:kiara-raora)). Raora was not one to talk but rather she remained quiet and [passive](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=5774) during most interactions, preferring to listen and occasionally offer a chuckle (wheeze) or a nod.

[She's just laughing](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?t=5854)

Throughout the day, she participated in various quests, often relying on her guildmates' assistance. Together, they successfully conquered the *Underworld Dungeon* and recovered the memories of *[Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=9964)*. While many would have taken a moment to rest, Raora chose to continue exploring the world.

Her adventures led to several memorable encounters. She met new faces, laughed at their antics, and at one point, suggested trading *Gura’s* life for her [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=10513). Raora's fondness for building soon became apparent as she gathered materials and began [constructing](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=12337) a base for her guild alongside Shakira. In doing so, she was among the first heroes to focus on such tasks, finding great satisfaction in the process.

One of the more entertaining moments of her adventure involved *Tam Gandr*. Tam made repeated efforts to teach Raora the correct pronunciation of her name, but Raora consistently mispronounced it, much to Tam’s frustration. Their conversation took an interesting turn when Tam declared her destiny to become the *Queen of Libestal*. Raora, however, countered with a confident assertion that she was destined for that role (see [Raora-Tam: Say my name](#edge:raora-kronii)).

Her interactions with others were just as unpredictable. She accidentally hurt *Nerissa’s* feelings by bluntly saying they weren’t [friends](https://www.youtube.com/live/8ybUOw9NhMc?feature=shared\&t=13860), she also tried to charm *Gonathon* with some suggestive gestures, only to casually mention that she planned to overthrow the king.

Later on, deciding that earning the trust of her "future subjects" was important, Raora volunteered to help Nerissa, Bijou, and the dog-like twins in the Underworld Dungeon, as she was to be the next queen after all. Although it's debatable whether her bursting into laughter when Fuwawa and Bijou fell into a pool of lava would be considered queenly behavior.

After helping them complete the dungeon, Raora finally called it a day. It had been a fun and eventful one, and perhaps the first steps toward her self-proclaimed destiny as the next queen of Libestal.
