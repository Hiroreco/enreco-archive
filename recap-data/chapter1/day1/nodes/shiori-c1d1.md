*Shiori* woke up in the white box with no memories, full of questions: *Who’s this? What’s that? Where’s Waldo?* As she wandered around, inspecting (and judging) the [others](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared\&t=97), she frequently conversed with the 'guardian angels' in her head, affectionately calling them *"Chat"*.

Every time she tried something new, she’d ask, *"Chat, am I cookin’?"*. She also faintly recalled an image of a truck heading toward her in a place called "New York," hinting at how she might have ended up here.

Her first interactions with the group were, predictably, odd. She called Bijou "rock hard" and demanded money from [Calli](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared\&t=840), just because she could. Then she met Nerissa, who claimed to be her [wife](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared\&t=2562). Shiori, unconvinced, pointed out the lack of a ring and refused a kiss, noting Nerissa seemed like she’d kiss anyone.

Shiori’s unpredictability was, well, unpredictablle, she floated around to wherever she found interseting, and said the most absurd things one can [think of](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared\&t=2519).

When the *Stain King* was about to appear, Shiori tried to [run](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared\&t=2774) from her responsibilities but was stopped by an invisible barrier. Resigned to her fate, she fought..or not. Instead of assiting her comrades, she stood by the side, and just watched, for the entirety of the fight.

It wasn't until she was forced into a 'cutscene' did she finally start to act. Her weapon, a [feather](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared\&t=3110), revealed its *Revelation*: shooting magical beams at enemies, but she liked to refered to it as "tickling them to death". After the battle, she was sorted into the *Scarlet Wand* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared\&t=3347).

As her journey began, Shiori embarked on quests with her guildmates, spending much of her time with her "goth" comrade Fauna, whom she affectionately called her wonderful majestic [green lady](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared\&t=4218). In return, Fauna referred to Shiori as her wonderful majestic Oreo. Their conversations meandered through topics like dentists and places like 'hot topics', a prime example of what some might call ["yapping"](https://www.youtube.com/live/KSaC99K4IF8?feature=shared\&t=4528).

Unlike the others, Shiori didn’t tackle the *Underworld Dungeon* on the first day, as she had other matters to attend to. Left alone with her thoughts, she began to question everything. She didn’t believe the town was real, suspecting it was part of a complex scheme to keep her memoryless because she was "too dangerous". Shiori didn’t trust the King—or, as she put it, "this suspicious place". Her skepticism ran deep, and her unpredictable mind continued to wander as her journey unfolded.
