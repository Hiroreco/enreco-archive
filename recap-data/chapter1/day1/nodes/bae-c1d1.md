<!-- title: Peasant The Bae -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

When she suddenly found herself in a mysterious white box surrounded by strangers, her immediate reaction was to [panic](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=281). Huh, whuh, where am I? Who are all these folks? Crikey, what’s happenin’? Let me out! That was the rat's entrance into the fantasy world; it was... understandable, to say the least.

She claimed a corner to herself, staying put like a feral animal, ranting as a crazed old man would about the end of the world. Anyone who dared approach was met with a wild-eyed glare and threatening [babbling](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=343). She was not having it. She made it clear to everyone that she was a rat—a very weak one, in fact—and had no interest in playing hero, or whatever it was that she was summoned for.

Her first real interaction was with Tam Gandr, who casually mentioned she was destined to become the next _Queen of Libestal_ (or so she claimed). Bae, starstruck by the revelation, saw an opportunity. If Tam became queen, maybe she could convince the King to send Bae back to her old life. Introducing herself as _Peasant The Bae_, she swore to protect Tam in hopes of earning that favor.

During the battle with the Stain King, Bae briefly entertained the idea that she might actually be destined for a heroic title. That hopeful thought vanished the moment a laser beam hit her square in the [face](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8bcLA6BQsw&t=3059s). Her weapon of choice, a [die](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=3171), mirrored her unpredictable nature. Its Revelation? Rolling a number between 1 and 6, with the resulting explosions matching the roll.

Despite her paranoia, she made it through the fight and was sorted into the [Amber Coin](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=3446) guild alongside three others.

Once in the kingdom, Bae’s adventures continued. She immediately clashed with _Cleopatra Eisenhower Da Vinci III the Great_, known as Three, who was also part of Amber Coin. Three wasted no time calling Bae a [weirdo](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=3510). Three did make fun of Bae before when someone tried to claim her [precious corner](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=2482), but this solidified the fact that her guildmate was not someone she could get along with.

The two developed a love-hate relationship that leaned heavily on the hate. (see [Bae-Three: Friends](#edge:bae-moom))

Despite her grumbling and reluctance, Bae completed her quests diligently. She hated the King for dragging her away from her comfortable life but went along with the tasks nonetheless. Toward the end of the day, she and her guildmates tackled the _Underworld Dungeon_ and recovered memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/y8bcLA6BQsw?feature=shared&t=9842).

For a moment, Bae considered the possibility that life here might not be so bad. Maybe she could make friends, build relationships, and fulfill her role as a hero... yeah, no. One dungeon was more than enough. After that, she disappeared, retreating to what she hoped would be an eternal nap, leaving her guildmates to handle the rest of the journey without her. A true hero’s exit.
