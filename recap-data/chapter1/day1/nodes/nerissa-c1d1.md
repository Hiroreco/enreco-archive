<!-- title: Nerissa Juliet Ravencroft -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

_Nerissa_, like everyone else, woke up in a white box with no memories of her past. Although overwhelmed, she tried her best to start conversations with those around her, having small chats here and there.

However, her longest initial conversation was with a maiden in red, _Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame_. Their chat consisted of simple introductions, but there was an undeniable sense of familiarity, like a deeper connection existed between [them](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=l3socXPAD6ViAdz6&t=1654).

The voices in Nerissa’s head complicated things further by claiming Shiori was her [wife](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=IrdKxeAeyiGiGTRo&t=2831). Hold on a minute, as if that wasn’t confusing enough, Nerissa also believed Shakira was her [wife?](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=OQzUggvD5b5qEPR-&t=2858) She had two wives?? And that they were destined to save the lesbians??? Wasn't this supposed to be a heroic tale about saving a kingdom invaded by dark forces?

A-anyway, during the battle with the Stain King, Nerissa’s weapon—a large [tuning fork](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=YUlEKwX4-40_5Ozy&t=3378)—was revealed. Upon activating its _Revelation_, she struck the fork against the enemy’s head, creating a shockwave that dealt damage to the enemy. After the battle, she was sorted into the Scarlet Wand [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=bBVH8rYcn0cL0hzO&t=3533).

Venturing into the new kingdom with her guildmates, Nerissa began adjusting to her new life. It was anything but smooth. She was baffled by the quest system, randomly earned [100 coins](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=Y5p-IBZHw__yD9o1&t=4842) without doing anything, got ambushed by [Stains](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=ee1ikNmeMoYdUCkA&t=5226) while trying to gather wood, and "soft locked" Gura in a [trade](https://www.youtube.com/live/PJSd7DYlGNo?si=cGT81Dci8yieBCmn&t=5619). She was very confused, and the voices in her head described her as having _"wet cat energy"_—whatever that meant.

Despite the chaos, Nerissa persevered, accompanied by the support and adoration of her guildmates, who found her quirks endearing.

While exploring the kingdom, she overheard a peculiar conversation between [Tam and Raora](https://www.youtube.com/live/DDwNcYCtAXw?si=HEyqQCWXDnTaUrnB&t=474), watching in silent bewilderment as Raora laughed hysterically and Tam spiraled into frustration. "I feel like I just experienced something I wasn’t supposed to," Nerissa muttered as she walked away.

Later, Nerissa teamed up with Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, and Raora to tackle the _Underworld Dungeon_. The experience was more amusing than frightening, especially when Nerissa watched her friends fall into a bottomless lava [pit](https://www.youtube.com/live/DDwNcYCtAXw?si=mGSwx70XvMtulrqg&t=3511). Despite the mishaps, they conquered the dungeon and recovered _[Mori Calliope’s](https://www.youtube.com/live/DDwNcYCtAXw?si=ceD6NIenRuYSxQYk&t=5176)_ memories.

After a bit more wandering, Nerissa called it a day. It had been confusing, chaotic, and a little painful at times, but ultimately fun—and that was all that mattered.
