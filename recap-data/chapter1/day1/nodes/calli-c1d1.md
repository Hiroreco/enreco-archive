<!-- title: Mori Calliope -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

_Calli_ had been working tirelessly—deadlines, projects, you name it. She decided it was time for a well-deserved break, going for a stroll with her beloved Deadbeats. But just as she was enjoying her walk, a truck crashed into her, knocking her out and sending her to the mysterious white box. How did a truck manage to take down the literal incarnation of Death? No clue, but here we are.

When Calli opened her eyes, confusion hit her like a second truck. She couldn't remember anything; everything looked boxy, voices were everywhere, and a chaotic, red figure was [shouting](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=2575). Overwhelmed and disoriented, Calli managed to find a bit of solace after a brief, calming exchange with _Shakira_, whom she quickly took a [liking to](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=893). Calli soon learned her name was _Mori Calliope_, thanks to the "floating text" above her head that everyone could [see](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=1658).

During the battle with the _Stain King_, Calli revealed her weapon: a [scythe](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=3259). Its Revelation? A deadly slash that cut through enemies with ease. After the battle, she was sorted into the _Jade Sword_ [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=3639), fitting her strong will and courage.

As her journey began, Calli stumbled her way through learning the ropes: tackling quests, forming parties, and figuring out how to use the telekinesis device. Adapting wasn’t easy; she even struggled just to enter and leave the [kingdom](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=4875). But Calli’s resolve was unbreakable. When Frieda and some others kept riding their horses into her and Liz, Calli didn’t hesitate to declare she’d duel them to set things right.

Calli eventually began building her own small [home](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=7457) in the kingdom. Later, she joined the Cerulean Cup members to take on the _Underworld Dungeon_. Before that, however, there was a bit of chaos when Liz, trying to pass as an Amber Coin member, accidentally got exposed by Calli, much to Liz’s dismay. Calli, blissfully unaware of the drama, observed the scene like a lost [child](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=8063).

Once inside the Underworld Dungeon with Tam and the "Hot Pink One," Calli felt something familiar. The bony, eerie atmosphere resonated deeply within her. When she saw a giant skull statue, she instinctively called it ["Father"](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=11570). It wasn’t until they conquered the dungeon that her memories returned. She was _Mori Calliope_, a Grim Reaper who had rejected the traditional role of taking lives. Instead, she sought a higher purpose—finding beauty and joy in human emotion as a replacement for souls.

The return of her memories filled Calli with fear and guilt. She felt like a traitor for abandoning her duties and leaving her people behind. But Tam and her fellow adventurers reassured her, accepting her [unconditionally](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=12438). Afterward, Calli had another chat with Shakira and spent more time exploring the kingdom, preparing for the next dungeon with the Cerulean Cup members. She even got called "Dad" by Koseki Bijou, much to her [surprise](https://www.youtube.com/live/xE3JQ1R2DdU?feature=shared&t=14424).

At the end of the day—a day that included being hit by a truck, losing her memories, navigating chaos, and rediscovering herself—Calli took a moment to reflect. It had been wild, but it wasn’t the end. Her enigmatic journey was only just beginning, with many more adventures yet to come.
