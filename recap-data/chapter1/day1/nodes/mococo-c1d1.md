_Mococo_ woke up in a strange white room, completely confuzzled and on edge, with everyone around her appearing suspicious.

Backed into a corner and overwhelmed, she let out a series of nervous "Haeh" sounds, her usual response when she didn’t know what was going on. Thankfully, the tension eased as she got to know the others. They were weird but friendly. She also occasionally let out "Bau Bau" as a way to express her emotions.

During the battle with the _Stain King_, Mococo didn’t have the best start—being the [first to fall](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=3153). She didn’t stay down long though, and that’s when her true weapon made its debut: a pair of [sharp pink claws](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=3184). When their _Revelation_ activated, Mococo unleashed a wild flurry of slashes, her movements filled with raw fury. After the battle, she found herself sorted into the _Jade Sword_ [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=3462).

Her first encounter in the guild was with _Fuwawa Abyssguard_, who looked so similar to her it was almost uncanny.

Just when Mococo thought she’d gotten over her initial fear of this new world, a different fear crept in: loneliness. When checking out the Jade Sword arena, she wandered off alone and, realizing she was left behind, began to panic. Luckily, her guildmates found her in time and promised they’d always stick by her side (see [Elizabeth-Mococo: By your side](#edge:mococo-liz)).

With her fears calmed, Mococo dove into learning about this strange world. She lit up with joy when she figured out how to ride a [horse](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared&t=4345) and couldn’t stop laughing as she repeatedly destroyed a berry bush for fun. Though she was often confused, it didn’t stop her from having a blast.

Later, Mococo teamed up with _Bijou, Nerissa, Fuwawa, and Raora_ to tackle the _Underworld Dungeon_. Let’s just say it was chaos—filled with shrieks and yelps, mostly from [Mococo and Fuwawa](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared&t=2143). Despite her best efforts to be brave, she looked more like a frightened pup than a fierce guard dog.

Through many screams, screeches, and numerous plunges to their doom, the five of them managed to conquer the dungeon and recover memories of _[Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared&t=3463)_. Afterwards, she hung out with the four girls for a bit, getting very frustrated when she got [lost](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared&t=3688), got escorted by _Mysterious Hero I_ to the [shore](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared&t=4152), and finally decided to call it a day.

It was a day full of confusion and excitement for Mococo. Her pure, innocent nature made her stand out, and everyone appreciated her for it. Hopefully, she’d stay that way—untouched by greed or temptation, especially when things like, say, a lottery came into play.
