*Mococo* woke up in a strange white room, completely confuzzled and on edge, with everyone around her appearing suspicious.

Backed into a corner and overwhelmed, she let out a series of nervous "Haeh" sounds, her usual response when she doesn’t know what’s going on. Thankfully, the tension eased as she got to know the others. They were weird but friendly. She also ocasionally let out "Bau Bau" as a way to express her emotions.

During the battle with the *Stain King*, Mococo didn’t have the best start—being the [first to fall](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared\&t=3153). She didn’t stay down long, though, and that’s when her true weapon made its debut: a pair of [sharp pink claws](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared\&t=3184). When their *Revelation* activated, Mococo unleashed a wild flurry of slashes, her movements filled with raw fury. After the battle, she found herself sorted into the *Jade Sword* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared\&t=3462).

Her first encounter in the guild was with *Fuwawa Abyssguard*, who looked so similar it was almost uncanny.

Just when Mococo thought she’d gotten over her initial fear of this new world, a different fear crept in: loneliness. When checking out the Jade Sword arena, she wandered off alone and, realizing she was left behind, began to panic. Luckily, her guildmates found her in time and promised they’d always stick by her (see [Elizabeth-Mococo: By your side](#edge:mococo-liz-left-3-right-2)).

With her fears calmed, Mococo dove into learning about this strange world. She lit up with joy when she figured out how to ride a [horse](https://www.youtube.com/live/OSjlqA0FS9Q?feature=shared\&t=4345) and couldn’t stop laughing as she repeatedly destroyed a berry bush for fun. Though she was often confused, it didn’t stop her from having a blast.

Later, Mococo teamed up with *Bijou, Nerissa, Fuwawa, and Raora* to tackle the *Underworld Dungeon*. Let’s just say it was chaos—filled with shrieks and yelps, mostly from [Mococo and Fuwawa](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared\&t=2143). Despite her best efforts to be brave, she looked more like a frightened pup than a fierce guard dog.

Through many screams, screeches, and the many times falling into their doom, the five of them did manage to conquer the dungeon, and recovered memories of *[Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared\&t=3463)*. She hung out with the four girls for a bit afterwards, getting very frusrated when she got [lost](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared\&t=3688), got escorted by *Mysterious Hero I* to the [shore](https://www.youtube.com/live/ASF0b50sKM0?feature=shared\&t=4152), and finally dedcided to call it a day.

It was a day full of confusion and excitement for Mococo. Her pure, innocent nature made her stand out, and everyone appreciated her for it. Hopefully, she’d stay that way—untouched by greed or temptation, especially when things like, say, a lottery came into play.
