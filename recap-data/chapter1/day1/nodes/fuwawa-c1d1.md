A soft, timid *"Bau bau"* escaped from *Fuwawa* as she woke up in the white box. Everything was unfamiliar. Someone seemed oddly familiar to her—Mococo Abyssguard—but like Mococo, Fuwawa was completely lost and confused.

As she moved around, sniffing those around her, she couldn’t shake the feeling that Nerissa was [trouble](https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?feature=shared&t=572), much like Mococo had sensed. When talking to Raora, Fuwawa introduced herself as a demon dog, though her gentle demeanor and iconic "Ehehehe" giggle made it hard to imagine anything demonic about her. She radiated warmth, more fluffy than fearsome.

During the battle with the *Stain King*, Fuwawa revealed her weapon: a pair of [sharp blue claws](https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?feature=shared&t=3181). When she activated their *Revelation*, a whirlwind of slashes tore through the enemy. After the battle, she was sorted into the *Jade Sword* [guild](https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?feature=shared&t=3471), ready to begin her journey.

Fuwawa’s adventure in the kingdom was off to a calm start. She explored the new world, took on quests, and like always found herself adorably [confused](https://www.youtube.com/live/3s_pVYBEax0?feature=shared&t=4981) most of the time. But that was part of her charm, and everyone around her found it endearing. Oddly, Mococo’s voice would occasionally echo around Fuwawa, even when Mococo wasn’t nearby, as if the two were in the same room.

To avoid further confusion when filling out tasks, Fuwawa tried her best to stay focused when reading the requirements. She was so focused that she completely ignored the Hot Pink One's attempt to greet her.

Later, Fuwawa joined forces with Nerissa, Bijou, Mococo, and Raora to tackle the *Underworld Dungeon*. The conquest, though chaotic, ended successfully with the group recovering memories of [Mori Calliope](https://www.youtube.com/live/uIHK81QMI24?feature=shared&t=3462). Afterward, Fuwawa spent time with the group before calling it a day.
