<!-- title: Safe Journey -->

Out of all the so-called "followers" Queen Tam Gandr had gathered, Gonathon was probably the most normal and level-headed of them all—and, surprisingly, one of the few who was actually loyal to her. He diligently reported on matters in the kingdom, had her back whenever she was puzzled or in need of assistance, and remained composed even when the rest of their guildmates were far less cooperative.

But more than just her reliable right-hand man, Tam found that her relationship with Gonathon was solid. She could trust him. Sure, he had his silly moments, but he had never turned his back on her. Whenever she called, he would appear immediately—like the time when Raora was annoying her again, and without hesitation, Gonathon stepped in to shield his Queen from the pink cat’s antics.

And despite the many ways he could have looked down on her—being richer, knowing more about the kingdom, and generally having more while Tam had less—Gonathon never once overstepped his bounds. He knew his place and stayed loyal through everything.

A knight for his Queen, through and through. And Tam? She appreciated it.
