<!-- title: Impromptu Adoption -->

Elizabeth had already taken on quite a few roles throughout her journey—protector of two pups, the king’s loyal knight, a steadfast guardian to those in need—all in the spirit of bringing happiness to others. But now, she was about to gain yet another title: mother.

It all happened so suddenly. She had been casually conversing with Bijou and Cecilia when, out of nowhere, the gem maiden brought up the idea of becoming Elizabeth’s adopted daughter. Why? Simply because she wanted to add the Bloodflame surname to her own.

Elizabeth was understandably baffled, completely taken aback, but Bijou’s sparkling, expectant eyes gave Elizabeth no time to process. The sheer weight of her enthusiasm was overwhelming.

Besides, wasn’t making people happy exactly what Elizabeth strived for? It aligned with her ideals. And so, flustered but resolute, she accepted.

Surprisingly, Elizabeth fit the role well. She encouraged Bijou when she accomplished something impressive, shielded her from danger, and even stood up for her daughter when her daughter's wife was cheating on her. And in return, Bijou played the part of a real daughter—by pushing her mother to pursue the person she herself was in love with. The same person who was already married to Bijou's own wife.

...Yeah, okay, that part was a bit complicated, but the sentiment was there.

Even when Elizabeth felt a tinge of [disapproval](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared\&t=9716) upon learning that her new daughter supported Tam Gandr as Queen, it didn’t change the fact that she cared for her.

She may not have been a real mother, but she was still a real knight—one with a kind and caring heart.
