Elizabeth was never one to let a perceived wrongdoing go unchecked. So when the newly opened _FaunaMart_, managed by Ceres Fauna, came onto the scene, she was immediately wary.

From the moment Fauna used what Elizabeth could only describe as "witchcraft" to advertise FaunaMart directly into her mind the day before, distrust took root. The Scarlet Knight believed Fauna's enticing lottery tickets for so-called "big jackpots" were nothing more than a ploy to corrupt her guildmates and strip them of their hard-earned property.

The tension between them only escalated during their first one-on-one interaction while completing quests.

Fauna claimed that her efforts, including running FaunaMart, were all for the library—a noble endeavor, she said, meant for the betterment of the people. But Elizabeth remained skeptical. Her doubts deepened when, upon requesting Fauna's help with a dungeon quest, Fauna demanded compensation—1,000 coins, no less.

Perhaps there was some truth to Fauna's words, but for now, Elizabeth saw her as a witch—a cunning and greedy one—whose true motives seemed firmly rooted in the pursuit of profit. Only time would reveal whether Fauna's actions were as selfless as she claimed.
