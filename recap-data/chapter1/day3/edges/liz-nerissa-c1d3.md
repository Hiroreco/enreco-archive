<!-- title: Beautiful Maiden -->

Elizabeth had never thought she’d feel anything beyond her unwavering sense of duty—to fulfill her tasks, protect the king, and safeguard those around her. But whenever she crossed paths with Nerissa, a strange sensation stirred within her. It was a feeling she couldn’t quite identify—like butterflies fluttering in her stomach. This day was no exception—in fact, it turned out to be one where they could finally spend some time alone together.

Their interaction was brief, but Elizabeth cherished every moment of it. She found herself captivated by Nerissa’s charm and effortless presence, a stark contrast to her own disciplined demeanor.

However, her lofty expectations of the blue maiden were tempered when Nerissa revealed her true motivations for slaying Stains and completing the kingdom’s quests. It wasn’t out of duty or goodwill, but simply to earn money—for purchases and, most notably, _gambling_.

Despite this revelation, Elizabeth didn’t hold it against her. Not everyone needed to share her rigid sense of morality. After all, what mattered most was the connection they’d shared, however fleeting.

Truth be told, Elizabeth was a [fumbling mess](https://www.youtube.com/live/oVguNTPnDww?feature=shared&t=2740) whenever the blue maiden appeared. And every time they parted ways, Elizabeth quietly hoped for more moments with Nerissa in the days to come.
