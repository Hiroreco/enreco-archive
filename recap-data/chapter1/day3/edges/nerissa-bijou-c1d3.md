<!-- title: Fake Honkers -->

Only a day after her marriage, Bijou found herself facing unexpected obstacles in her sweet, sugarcoated life. As she greeted her wife, Shiori, upon waking, Bijou discovered some shocking news: Shiori had somehow acquired another wife. That wife was none other than Nerissa Juliet Ravencroft.

The moment Bijou heard the name, she knew she had a new rival. Her disdain for Nerissa was fueled not only by jealousy but also by insecurity—Nerissa’s hourglass figure stood in stark contrast to Bijou’s own petite, plywood-like frame.

The blue maiden caused Bijou to become convinced that Shiori no longer cared about their marriage and wanted to be with Nerissa instead. Overcome with heartbreak, she ran off in tears. How the situation was resolved remains unclear—it simply seemed to work itself out (see [Bijou-Shiori: Soap Opera](#edge:shiori-bijou)).

But the emotional wound lingered for Bijou, and she couldn't forgive Nerissa for the pain she caused. From that day forward, Bijou took every opportunity to jab at her rival, even going so far as to claim that Nerissa’s enviable figure was fake.
