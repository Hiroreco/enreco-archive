<!-- title: Annoying Cat -->

Tam had never messed with Raora—ever. In fact, if she had it her way, she wouldn’t have anything to do with the sassy pink cat at all. She just wanted to go about her business in peace. But Raora? Oh, she had other plans. For her, it wasn’t just about annoying Tam (though that was a nice bonus). No, it was about sending a message—a declaration of war. A reminder that she, and not Tam, was the true Queen of the kingdom.

So when Raora caught wind that Tam was building a base of her own, she wasted no time in doing what she did best—getting all up in the blue lady’s business and annoying the absolute heck out of her.
