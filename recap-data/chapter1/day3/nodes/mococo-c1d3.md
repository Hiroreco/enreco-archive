_"I won... I won!"_ the doggo excitedly whispered to herself as she began her fourth day in the kingdom. The day had only just started, but Mococo's mind was already fixated on one thing: winning the lottery. She was ecstatic—the most excited she had been since the start of her journey—so she wasted no time rushing to FaunaMart to claim her prize.

Upon arriving at FaunaMart, Fauna herself was surprised that someone had actually won. She congratulated Mococo and handed over her prize money. Mococo had won a total of _710 coins_, which seemed like a lot... until you considered that she had spent 680 coins the day before buying all the tickets. In the end, she made a grand profit of _30 coins_—not much, but what mattered to her was the thrill of winning.

Naturally, being the responsible adult she was, she decided to reinvest all her money back into the lottery. She purchased a total of [71 tickets](https://www.youtube.com/live/zh0satM3cEs?feature=shared&t=515), despite warnings from others that this might not be the smartest idea.

As she went about her day, she proudly boasted about her win to everyone she met, including Elizabeth and Nerissa. While they congratulated her, their concern grew upon learning that she had spent all her money on lottery tickets [again](https://www.youtube.com/live/zh0satM3cEs?feature=shared&t=1395).

Later, Mococo joined Raora, Fuwawa, Elizabeth, and Calli to tackle the _Eldritch Horror Dungeon_. True to her easily frightened nature, there were countless moments when she got startled, much like a small puppy encountering the unknown. Despite her fears, the group succeeded in their mission and recovered the [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/zh0satM3cEs?feature=shared&t=3965) of _Ninomae Ina'nis_.
