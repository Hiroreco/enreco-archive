Bijou's objective for the third day was simple: make lots of money. But unlike Gonathon, who was making money to pay his dowry, help the community and his queen, or Nerissa who was supporting her guildmate with their business, Bijou's goal for riches was much grander. It was for... *a hat*.

She had been yearning for one ever since she stepped foot in this kingdom. Every day up until now, she had lived in shame, watching others with their long red hats, blue square hats, and green L-shaped hats, while she possessed no hat of her own. This was going to change today. But, of course, like always, there were plenty of shenanigans along the way.

At the start of her day, Bijou decided to check out FaunaMart. She was surprised to learn that, despite hearing rumors about the business being a scam, someone had actually won the lottery—and it was Mococo, no less. Hearing about the massive prize pool, Bijou wasted no time buying some tickets of [her own](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared\&t=616).

Knowing that Bijou needed *Stain Bones* for her quest, Fauna advertised that she was selling them—though at very high prices. Bijou declined, confident she could get them herself.

However, while struggling to slay the Stains for the bones, Bijou received an [ad call](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared\&t=2340) from Fauna, reminding her that she could purchase the bones at her store instead. She continued struggling and received yet another [ad call](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared\&t=2565). Eventually, having great difficulty acquiring the bones on her own, she yielded and returned to FaunaMart to [buy them](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared\&t=3325).

Continuing her day, Bijou noticed that her wife, Shiori, was awake and went to greet her. However, during their conversation, she couldn’t help but notice Shiori referring to her as *"my other wife"*, hinting at a relationship with another woman (see [Bijou-Shiori: Soap Opera](#edge:shiori-bijou)).

After this, they turned their attention to one of the primary tasks for the day: tackling the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*. Joining Bijou were Shiori, Tam, and Gonathon. Together, they conquered the dungeon and recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/Tl7rUzJyc_0?feature=shared\&t=12019) of *Ninomae Ina'nis*.

With all the "unimportant stuff" out of the way, it was finally time for Bijou to focus on her ultimate goal: getting her much coveted a hat.

Desperate for this hat, she spent every last coin trying to obtain it. She completed quests to earn money, but failed to get a hat. She gambled for more money, but failed to get a hat. She asked others for money but still failed. Even when she found an exploit to earn a ridiculous amount of money, it didn’t work out. As others were getting hats left and right, Bijou could only hold in her jealousy for so long.

Failure after failure, Bijou was starting to lose hope. Perhaps it wasn’t meant to be, for her to don a hat of her own.

But just when despair was setting in, it finally happened. After many, many gacha pulls, she finally got a hat. And it wasn’t just any hat—it was a hat in the shape of a Stain, which she thought was very cool. It only took her *forty-two* tries and cost her *12,600 coins*. Not exactly the most efficient way to spend money, but it was worth it nonetheless.

Bijou could now go to sleep happily, donning the hat she had yearned for so long.
