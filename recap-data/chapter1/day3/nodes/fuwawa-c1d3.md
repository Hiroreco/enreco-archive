The fluffy one began her fourth day with a calm start, engaging in a small [chat](https://www.youtube.com/live/BehFIHehD_Y?feature=shared&t=439) with Nerissa about hats and various topics. True to her nature, Fuwawa's perspective remained serene and, well, fluffy. In stark contrast, her counterpart, the ever-fuzzy Mococo, was rushing by her side to FaunaMart to claim her lottery winnings. Fuwawa was surprised to learn that Mococo had won, but her surprise quickly turned to concern as she watched her not-sister buy 71 more tickets, transforming into a money-hungry adventurer.

Fuwawa then visited the newly established diner built by Calli. She had her eyes set on an Ultimate Fruit Milkshake, but lacking the funds, she resolved to work harder and save up to buy one [someday](https://www.youtube.com/live/BehFIHehD_Y?feature=shared&t=639) (unlike a certain someone who had recklessly spent all her savings on lottery tickets).

Venturing further, Fuwawa completed quests and crossed paths with Elizabeth, who became her [breadlady](https://www.youtube.com/live/BehFIHehD_Y?feature=shared&t=1194), like, in a literal sense. Finally, it was time to prepare for the _Eldritch Horror Dungeon_. Joining her were Elizabeth, Mococo, Raora, and Calli. Together, they bravely conquered the dungeon and recovered the [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/BehFIHehD_Y?feature=shared&t=4357) of _Ninomae Ina'nis_.
