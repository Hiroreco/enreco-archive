Gonathon's third day's objective was simple: make lots of money. The reason was twofold: first, he needed to pay Calli 500 coins a day as promised on day two, when Calli demanded a daily dowry for Gonathon to maintain his marriage to Jyon Watson. Second, he wanted to purchase as much building material as possible for his queen, Tam Gandr, to assist her in constructing the Cerulean Cup guild base.

Though his goal was as clear as day, the journey was anything but smooth.At the very start of his day, Gonathon found himself ambushed—not by monsters, but by Raora. The mischievous big pink cat wasted no time [teasing](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared\&t=1395) him relentlessly. Knowing that Gonathon's unwavering loyalty was to Tam, Raora used her charms and beauty to exploit his one weakness.

Yet, her antics didn’t stop there. Throughout the day, she seemed to [stalk](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared\&t=2160) him, appearing around every corner, much to Gonathon's growing frustration. To vent it out, she hit Elizabeth with his horse.

Despite being distracted by the ever-persistent Raora, Gonathon stayed focused on his objective. He worked diligently and effectively, earning more money than he had anticipated. Being the humble and loyal knight that he was, he didn’t hoard his wealth but instead used it to help others.

When his guildmate Bijou ran out of money after spending everything trying to obtain a hat, Gonathon gave her a portion of his [earnings](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared\&t=1567). He also offered Cecilia some coin—not to aid her in any noble endeavor, but simply to stop her from incessantly pestering him about her latest conspiracy theory involving the [king](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared\&t=2891). Even FaunaMart benefited from his [generosity](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared\&t=3346), as he donated a substantial amount toward their library-building project, though it wasn't entirely sure the library was a legitimate venture.

Later, Gonathon was invited by Calli to visit her newly opened *diner*, which boasted a unique menu of diverse meals paired with free divorce services. Coincidentally, he crossed paths with his queen, Tam, at the diner. Eager to report his progress, Gonathon proudly told her about all the building materials he had been gathering for her. Tam, surprised and overjoyed, rewarded everyone by treating them to a meal using her ["eight thousand coins"](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared\&t=9637) that she claimed to possess. Nevertheless, the gesture was appreciated by all.

After a fulfilling meal, Gonathon moved on to the next major task of the day: conquering the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*. His party included Tam, Shiori, and Bijou. While his bravery and energy were well-known in the kingdom, his fear of horror was a closely guarded secret.However, in the dark and eerie depths of the dungeon, that fear was laid bare. He flinched at sudden noises, froze when left alone in the dark, and struggled to keep his composure throughout the journey. It was a stark contrast to his usual persona, but despite his trepidation, Gonathon pressed on.

Through teamwork and perseverance, the group emerged victorious, recovering the [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/6exWVCmzA9I?feature=shared\&t=10803) of *Ninomae Ina’nis*. With their mission complete, Gonathon returned to the kingdom to assist Tam in building the guild base. He poured the remainder of his energy into the task, dedicating himself entirely to helping her realize her vision (see [Gonathon-Tam: Knight and Queen](#edge:gigi-kronii-bottom-2-left-2)).
