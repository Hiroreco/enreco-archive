Calli was thrilled for day three, not because of any grand adventure or remarkable event, but because her long-awaited tavern was finally complete. Her business, named *"Death Do Us Part,"* was officially open for business. A diner that not only served delicious food but also offered free divorce services alongside every meal. She was immensely proud and couldn’t wait to see her first customers.

Calli gave a quick tour of the tavern. Painted in shades of green to match her guild, the building was accented with white quartz for a bright and inviting diner-like vibe. The establishment had two floors. The first floor housed the main dining area. Upon entering, customers were greeted by a wall-mounted menu that listed a variety of dishes, including the prized *"Ultimate Fruit Milkshake."*

Next to the menu was the divorce board, where all divorces—offered free with a meal—would be recorded on a sign and displayed. The corner of the room held the kitchen, bustling with activity. Upstairs, the second floor was a "special room" designed for adventuring pairs or couples to rent for private moments. While the window view was meant to showcase the coliseum across the street, it was unfortunately blocked by the towering [FaunaMart](https://www.youtube.com/live/efqkfe_5O0s?feature=shared\&t=753). Still, the promise of excellent eats was what truly mattered.

Excited, Calli ventured into the kingdom to announce her grand opening. She encountered Gonathon and collected his daily dowry of [500 coins](https://www.youtube.com/live/efqkfe_5O0s?feature=shared\&t=2608), then crossed paths with Cecilia, who was desperate to obtain a Scarlet Wand hat. The green maiden saw Calli donning the coveted hat, and so they struck a deal: Cecilia would buy food from the tavern and play Calli a special song in exchange for the hat.

However, Cecilia was flat broke and had made the promise out of desperation. Calli, pitying her, decided to gift her the hat anyway, marking her first unofficial customer.

Later, Fuwawa expressed interest in visiting the diner. Calli enthusiastically showed her around and tried to sell her the Ultimate Fruit Milkshake, but, like Cecilia, Fuwawa had [no money](https://www.youtube.com/live/efqkfe_5O0s?feature=shared\&t=3995). Disheartened, Calli had no choice but to kick her out. It seemed the kingdom’s citizens were not as financially stable as she had hoped.

Despite the setbacks, Calli prepared for the main event of the day: tackling the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*. Her new kitchen allowed her to cook meals for herself and her teammates. Joining her on the quest were Fuwawa, Mococo, Raora, and Elizabeth. Together, they successfully conquered the dungeon and recovered the memories of [Ninomae Ina’nis](https://www.youtube.com/live/efqkfe_5O0s?feature=shared\&t=7707).

On her way back to the tavern, Calli ran into Tam Gandr. Calli eagerly invited her to dine at the tavern, and to her delight, Tam agreed, bringing along Gonathon, Bijou, and Shiori as additional customers. Calli was ecstatic—this was her chance to finally make some profit! Tam, as the self-proclaimed queen, surely had plenty of wealth to cover the meals.

Everyone placed their orders, and Tam volunteered (or was forced) to pay. However, after Calli prepared and served the food, she discovered that Tam was even more broke than her previous customers. Reluctantly, and not wanting to embarrass the queen in front of her followers, Calli gave the food in what she considered an unfair trade.

By the end of the day, Calli realized her business had made zero profit—worse, she had gone into the negatives. Nevertheless, she remained optimistic. While the food might not have been the highlight of her tavern, the divorces surely would be, and she was confident her unique service would gain traction soon enough.
