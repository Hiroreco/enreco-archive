More flashes of memory surfaced as Elizabeth awoke for the day. This time, she recalled her interaction with Shakira from the day before.

Memories, eh. Upon joining the kingdom, Elizabeth reflected on her journey thus far.

Thrown into this journey, devoid of memories, she had made new comrades and forged new connections. Over the first two days, she had managed to recover the memories of Mori Calliope and Gawr Gura. Yet, she couldn’t help but wonder: when would she regain her own memories? She felt as though a part of her was missing—something precious, or perhaps someone.

This inner thought lingered for a moment, but Elizabeth quickly shook it off, pumping herself up for the fourth day of her adventure.

Elizabeth made her way to the quest board in search of more tasks. There, she was greeted by Nerissa, and to her dismay, she became a complete mess in front of the raven-haired lady. Elizabeth had been feeling "weird" whenever she was around Nerissa, but she couldn’t quite figure out what the feeling was (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Beautiful Maiden](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

Moving on, Elizabeth wandered around and met Cecilia and Bijou, who were engrossed in a conversation about various questionable topics. Liz was left dumbfounded throughout the exchange. To her surprise, Bijou suddenly asked Liz to be her mother. Though confused, Liz accepted. Her bewilderment only deepened further when she learned that her newly adopted daughter was already married (see [Elizabeth-Bijou: Impromptu Adoption](#edge:liz-bijou)).

As many friends as Elizabeth made, she also had her skepticism toward a few—specifically, those she suspected of being witches. And at the top of that list? The mastermind behind the latest lottery craze, Ceres Fauna. Something about this green lady just didn’t sit right with Elizabeth, and she wasn’t about to let her guard down (see [Elizabeth-Fauna: She's a Witch](#edge:liz-fauna)).

Later in the day, she was invited by Raora to tackle the dungeon of the day: the _Eldritch Horror Dungeon_. Joining them were Calli and the two doggos. During the conquest, while trying to help Mococo, who accidentally found herself stuck in a ditch, Elizabeth clumsily fell and shared the same situation as the fuzzy one.

Nonetheless, they managed to free themselves. Together, they conquered the dungeon and successfully recovered the memories of [Ninomae Ina'nis](https://www.youtube.com/live/oVguNTPnDww?feature=shared&t=7815).
