Shiori began her third day with a greeting from Bijou, her so-called wife. Not really sure if it's usual to say "Hello there, my other wife" to your beloved when you greet them, but the statement by Shiori left Bijou visibly puzzled, and it set the tone for the day—a mix of confusion and drama (see [Shiori-Bijou: Soap Opera](#edge:shiori-bijou-right-2-left-2)).

Later, Shiori ran into Nerissa, her alleged bird wife. Nerissa invited Shiori to assist her with the second dungeon, a task Nerissa had been unable to complete previously. Shiori declined the invitation outright, leaving Nerissa disappointed. To twist the knife, Shiori made a snarky comment about Nerissa’s hat before sending her on her way.

The refusals didn’t end there. Cecilia later invited Shiori to join her in tackling the Eldritch Horror dungeon. Once again, Shiori declined, citing plans with her wife (her rock wife, to be more specific).

After navigating the day’s chaos, Shiori finally found some time to focus on herself. She completed her quests, gathered funds, and continued building her humble abode. She also took a break to visit the "Death Do Us Part" tavern for a [meal](https://www.youtube.com/live/BnpLALzUzD4?feature=shared\&t=6718).

As the day drew to a close, Shiori teamed up with Bijou, Gonathon, and Tam Gandr to conquer the *Eldritch Horror dungeon*. Together, they successfully recovered fragments of *Ninomae Ina'nis’* [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/BnpLALzUzD4?feature=shared\&t=8370).
