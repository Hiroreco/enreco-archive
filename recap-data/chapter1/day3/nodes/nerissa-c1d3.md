Day three marked a turning point for Nerissa, as she discovered a new passion: the relentless pursuit of wealth. Unlike Fauna, who needed money to fuel her thriving business, or Gonathon, who used it to help others, Nerissa's goal was simple—she just liked being rich.

Her day began with a brief chat with Fauna, during which Nerissa declared her mission to amass as much money as [possible](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared\&t=313). Wasting no time, she dived into quests to build her fortune. It was during these quests that she stumbled upon a game-changing revelation: a "glitch" in the kingdom's system that allowed her to infinitely exploit a particular quest for its rewards.

For over thirty minutes, Nerissa abused this loophole, amassing thousands of coins in record time. The sheer speed and scale of her earnings left her feeling invincible. She shared her discovery only with those she trusted—namely, Bijou and Fauna—and explicitly warned the voices in her head to keep the glitch [a secret](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared\&t=5386).

Unfortunately for Nerissa, the voices [betrayed](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared\&t=7603) her. Word of the glitch spread quickly, prompting the kingdom’s gods to patch it. But not before Nerissa secured over 5,000 coins, cementing her status as one of the kingdom’s wealthiest individuals.

The rest of her day was less financially groundbreaking but still eventful. After [failing](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared\&t=7986) to recruit Shiori to accompany her to the second dungeon and inadvertently stirring up relationship [drama](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared\&t=9661) between Shiori and Bijou (see [Bijou-Shiori: Soap Opera](#edge:shiori-bijou-right-2-left-2)), Nerissa joined Fauna and Cecilia for the *Eldritch Horror Dungeon*. The team emerged victorious, recovering fragments of *Ninomae Ina'nis’* [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared\&t=11348).

After some lighthearted banter with Bijou, who was making fun of the bird woman's [fake chest](https://www.youtube.com/live/LH_8d-8gZow?feature=shared\&t=12326), Nerissa decided to end her day on a high note, satisfied with her newfound riches and ready for whatever the next day might bring.
