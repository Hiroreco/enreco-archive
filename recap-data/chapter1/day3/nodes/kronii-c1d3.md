The third day dawned for Tam, the blue, self-proclaimed Queen of Libestal. Upon entering the kingdom, she was greeted by Calli, who eagerly announced the opening of her new diner and promptly invited Tam to buy a meal. Tam was soon joined by Gonathon, Bijou, and Shiori, the latter being Bijou’s wife.

Despite the diner's variety of offerings, Tam was a picky eater and made an elaborate request: a meal free of sodium, dairy, gluten, and fruit. She made all those requests as she was looking at an item literally called the _Ultimate Fruit Milkshake_.

She then asked for something evocative of loneliness, and Calli recommended the Breakfast Toast, modestly priced at 50 coins. Tam, however, had only _58 coins_—an amount far too meager for a queen to admit. When questioned about her wealth, with dramatic flair, she claimed she had a fortune of _[8,000 coins](https://www.youtube.com/live/JcRcTRedS_8?feature=shared&t=945)_, gifted by the King himself.

The others believed her without question, impressed by her apparent riches. With that much wealth, Shiori suggested Tam buy everyone food to prove her generosity. The Queen reluctantly agreed and discreetly bargained with the diner owner for alternative payment methods.

Through wit and sheer determination, Tam managed to treat the group, concealing her near-emptied coin purse. With their meal concluded, they turned their focus to the day’s main quest: the _Eldritch Horror Dungeon_. Tam’s team, consisting of Bijou, Gonathon, and Shiori, together triumphed and recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/JcRcTRedS_8?feature=shared&t=2670) of _Ninomae Ina’nis_.

With the conquest completed, Tam returned to her construction of the Cerulean Cup guild base, a project she approached with dedication. Yet peace eluded her. The exaggerated tales of her supposed wealth spiraled out of control—what began as a boast of 8,000 coins became 8 million, then 8 billion, and ultimately 800 trillion. Her guildmates teased her endlessly, and Tam couldn’t help but regret the single lie that had snowballed into such absurdity.

Her work was interrupted further by Raora, the pink cat, whose mere presence sparked the usual verbal sparring. Tam, upon learning that Raora was from Amber Coin—a guild she despised—called for Bijou and Gonathon to help her eject Raora, dramatically claiming she was "being harmed" (see [Raora-Tam: Queens Standoff](#edge:raora-kronii)).

Afterwards, as the day waned, Tam finally found peace. After all, true to her nature, she found comfort in solitude. Tam turned her attention to the guild base—a project she was determined to finish because this was her last day in the kingdom. She was to attend to urgent business in a [faraway land](https://www.youtube.com/live/JcRcTRedS_8?feature=shared&t=12460).

But more important than the kingdom itself, this was her last day to spend with everyone—her guildmates.

As much as they caused her head wrinkles, she still cared for their well-being. Her goodwill had been shown from time to time again, like how she defended Gonathon and the Hot Pink One when they were interrogated by Elizabeth on the first day, or when she reminded Bijou to spend less money on gambling and gacha. She even fought to buy food for everyone despite having little to her name. And now, she was constructing a home for them all—a roof under which they could gather and reside.

The lady in blue was often cruel in her words, but deep inside, her heart was kind, empathetic, and full of care. The guild base was her way of showing this, a gift to the people she had grown to cherish (see [Gonathon-Tam: Safe Journey](#edge:gigi-kronii)).

After many hours of hard labor and frustration, the Cerulean Cup guild base was done.

The wooden structure stood as a testament to her dedication and creativity, adorned with cherry blossoms whose delicate petals danced in the breeze. The hallways were lit by the warm glow of torches, while sea lanterns illuminated the floors. Paintings decorated the walls, and each room was uniquely designed to reflect the guild members’ personalities. Bijou’s room featured her beloved pet rock, while Ina and the Hot Pink One had connected rooms to symbolize their bond. The second floor housed a spacious, cozy common area—a perfect gathering place for the friends she was leaving behind.

This was more than just a building; it was a piece of her soul, left in a place that had become a home, however briefly. She hoped they would use it well, filling its halls with laughter and the kind of memories she now carried with her.

And with that, Tam departed from Libestal, leaving behind a kingdom she had entered as a stranger but left as a cherished friend.
