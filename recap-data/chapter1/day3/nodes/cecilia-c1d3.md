Cecilia woke up on her third day feeling dizzy, as if she had hit her head. Her memories were hazy—something felt missing. Did something happen the day before? She couldn’t say for sure.

To make things stranger, she discovered a piece of paper tucked inside her shoe. Written in elegant green cursive were the words "find it...!" How did it get there? Who wrote it? And what did it mean? Confused but intrigued, Cecilia resolved to uncover the mystery.

However, before she could dive into this enigma, the usual chaos of her daily adventures unfolded.

At the start of the day, she ran into Bijou. The two shared their Revelations and somehow ended up having a bizarre conversation about detaching and reattaching Cecilia’s [limbs](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=1764). Cecilia, casually claiming she was an automaton—a living doll—assured Bijou it was perfectly normal. The encounter didn’t stop there. Cecilia found herself unofficially officiating Bijou’s adoption as Elizabeth’s daughter, claiming she was a certified [contractor](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=1910).

Later, at the quest board, Cecilia encountered Calli wearing the Scarlet Wand hat she had been coveting for days. Overcome with desire, she begged to trade for it. They struck a deal: Cecilia could have the hat if she purchased food from Calli’s tavern. But being broke, Cecilia had to scrounge together whatever useless trinkets she had to barter with. Somehow, it [worked](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=3020).

Along with the trade, Cecilia sang a song as part of her "payment," earning the hat she’d been dreaming of. Elated, she paraded it around to show off her prize to anyone willing to look.

Continuing her day, Cecilia bumped into Gonathon. Their conversation spiraled into her spouting wild conspiracy theories about the kingdom and its citizens. Gonathon listened with a mix of confusion and disbelief, silently wondering if she was entirely sane.

Amused or perhaps out of pity, he offered her 500 coins and declared her an honorary member of the Cerulean Cup.

During one of her quests, Cecilia found herself caught in the middle of a scandal. She had run into Shiori, only to discover she was embroiled in a marriage drama with Bijou. Cecilia couldn’t resist watching the chaos unfold as Bijou caught Shiori red-handed in a compromising situation. Cecilia was left [marveling](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=5886) at the drama, entertained by the tension between the wedded pair.

Eventually, it was time for Cecilia to face the _Eldritch Horror Dungeon_. Joining her on this journey were Nerissa and Fauna. Together, they navigated the dungeon’s dark corridors, defeating its challenges and recovering fragments of Ninomae Ina'nis’ [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/-QKg8Fau9GM?feature=shared&t=7361).

As with her previous days, Cecilia chose to wind down with some gambling. The day’s events had completely distracted her from the mysterious note she found that morning. But as she started to lose money again—her usual outcome—something strange happened. Red, ominous text flashed in her mind, reading, "Come find me."
"You mustn’t forget."

At first, Cecilia brushed it off, too engrossed in her gambling to give it much thought. But after emptying her pockets once again, the urgency of the messages finally sank in. She began asking others if they had experienced anything similar. With the strange paper in the morning and now these eerie messages, it was clear something—or someone—was calling to her.

Before she could investigate further, the key on her head abruptly stopped spinning. Her vision darkened, and the world around her faded into black.
