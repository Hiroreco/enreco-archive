FaunaMart was already under fire—despite being open for just one day, rumors swirled accusing the business of being a scam. Fauna couldn’t pinpoint the origin of these claims, but one thing was clear: she needed to save her company’s reputation. Thus, the green *CEO* devised a bold PR campaign to turn things around.

Her plan was straightforward yet effective: she would boost the jackpot prize with her own funds, start selling hats and other sought-after items, and recruit her Scarlet Wand guildmates to help manage sales in her absence. Fauna assured everyone that her lottery wasn’t gambling—because, according to her, it didn’t count, or if it did, it was the only form of it that should be [endorsed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc\&t=571s).

Fauna’s first order of business was to gather materials. Along the way, she quickly conquered the *Ocean Temple* [dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/menSag1VKTc?feature=shared\&t=5846), which she hadn’t had the chance to tackle the previous day. With plenty of resources in hand, Fauna returned to her shop, setting prices just exorbitant enough to not discourage sales and still make her plenty of profit.

Later, it was time to announce the day’s lottery winner. The winning number was 734, and much to Fauna’s shock, Mococo won the jackpot of 707 coins—unsurprising, given the doggo had purchased 68 tickets.

However, the rumors about FaunaMart’s illegitimacy persisted. Gonathon confronted Fauna, asking if her business was indeed a [scam](https://www.youtube.com/live/menSag1VKTc?feature=shared\&t=9225). With her smooth-talking charm, Fauna reassured him of her noble intentions to serve the community. Whether genuine or not, her words [worked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc\&t=9680s). Gonathon bought 130 tickets—30 of which were for Nerissa. The customers kept rolling in, with Bijou purchasing 10 tickets and even her former accuser, Raora, begrudgingly buying one as well.

As business boomed, Nerissa approached Fauna to share an alarming discovery: a "glitch" that allowed infinite money generation. While Nerissa’s intentions were pure, Fauna saw the devastating impact this could have on her business. Without hesitation, she reported it to the gods, who patched it immediately.

True to her expansion goals, Fauna focused on selling high-demand goods. When she found Bijou struggling to acquire Stain Bones for a quest, Fauna seized the opportunity to [advertise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc\&t=13038s) her wares. Relentlessly, she pitched her products until the rock maiden caved and made a [purchase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc\&t=14030s).

Despite her entrepreneurial ambitions, Fauna still had duties to fulfill. She joined Nerissa and Cecilia to take on the *Eldritch Horror dungeon*. Together, they triumphed, recovering fragments of *Ninomae Ina'nis’* [memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc\&t=17971s).

Returning to her store, Fauna was greeted by Mococo, who came to collect her lottery winnings—only to spend it all immediately on 71 more [tickets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menSag1VKTc\&t=14536s). Business was booming like never before. From lottery sales to rare goods and even her healing services, the capitalist queen in green had solidified her path to wealth.
