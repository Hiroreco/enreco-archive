## Day 3: Getting To Building

If marriages weren’t enough to tangle the kingdom’s relationship chart into a convoluted web, adoption has now entered the mix.

Day three proved to be an eventful one for Bijou—first, she was adopted by Elizabeth as her daughter, adding yet another layer to her ever-complicated existence. As if that weren’t enough, she also caught her wife in the midst of an affair with another woman, leading to a whirlwind of confusion, confrontation, and attempts at resolution. And amidst all this chaos, Bijou remained steadfast in her pursuit of something truly important: a hat.

Meanwhile, the ongoing rivalry between the self-proclaimed queens, Tam Gandr and Raora, continued to escalate—though at this point, it seemed to be more about Raora getting under Tam’s skin for her own amusement. This was also Tam's last day in the kingdom.

On a broader scale, the kingdom saw a shift as more heroes set aside their usual adventuring to focus on something more permanent—building. With foundations being laid and walls rising, new homes and businesses began to take shape. Among them, Shiori constructed a quaint pink abode to call her own, Raora erected a grand castle fitting for her self-proclaimed queenly status, Tam established a guild base for her guildmates, and Bijou created her rocky masterpiece.

Perhaps the most notable addition, however, was the grand opening of Mori’s Tavern, fittingly named _Death Do Us Part_. Beyond serving food and drinks to weary travelers, this establishment came with a unique selling point—_divorce services_. With relationships forming (and hopefully crumbling) at an alarming rate, Mori saw an opportunity and seized it, offering an easy way out for those entangled in the kingdom’s ever-expanding web of bonds.

Finally, returning to the main task of the day—the dungeon challenge. This time, our adventurers were sent into the ominous depths of the [_Eldritch Horror Dungeon_](https://x.com/hololive_En/status/1830787800968638636), a place shrouded in eerie whispers and creeping dread. The challenge? To complete a series of designated tasks within a reasonable timeframe before their sanity levels plummeted beyond salvation. Upon completion, the heroes were granted the recovered memories of [_Ninomae Ina’nis_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE5Ow4L1Zt8).
