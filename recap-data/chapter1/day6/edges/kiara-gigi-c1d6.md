<!-- title: The Oranges -->

Kiara was completely fixated on finding herself a marriage. Specifically, she had her eyes set on Gonathon, and to her, it made perfect sense—they were both orange, after all. However, knowing that Gonathon already had a beloved, she couldn't act on her desires—at least, not until the tournament began.

Unexpectedly, Kiara made it to the finals, and she secretly wished that Gonathon would make it there [as well](https://www.youtube.com/live/3cr3DLpyB60?feature=shared\&t=21430). She had a plan—a deal to propose. If Gonathon won, he would claim her title as the "True Orange." But here was the sweet part: if Kiara won, she would take his name, claiming Gonathon as her spouse. And Kiara was confident.

Adrenaline rushed through her veins—she was locked in. In fact, she won the first match, putting her one step closer to victory. But Gonathon wasn’t one to falter; he quickly took the second match, forcing a tiebreaker.

It was tense. The final match would decide everything. Winner takes all.

But as much as Kiara longed for Gonathon, his loyalty to his Pearl—the one he had spent the longest time with—was far stronger. With unwavering determination, Gonathon secured the final victory.

Kiara had lost. Her dream of claiming him as her own was shattered, and she would have to continue… without anyone by her side.
