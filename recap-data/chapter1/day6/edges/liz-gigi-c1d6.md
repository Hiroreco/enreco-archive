<!-- title: Unexpected Alliance -->

Gonathon was determined to find the culprit that had defaced the queen's statue, but seeing how it might be difficult to do alone, he decided to ask for help. He reached out to someone whom he didn't have a good impression of, considering the various mental damage she'd caused him on the first day, as well as her spitefulness for his queen Tam Gandr, but she was the only person he saw capable and trustworthy for something like this.

At first, she didn’t pick up (and left quite a funny [voicemail](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared\&t=2527)), but a little later, the red maiden, Elizabeth, called him [back](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared\&t=1092). They met up at Mori’s Tavern, where Gonathon explained his situation and proposed setting their differences aside to uncover the truth. Elizabeth wanted more details, and when she was shown an image of the defacement, she was baffled.

Seeing how bad it was, Elizabeth agreed to [assist](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared\&t=1407) Gonathon. Their primary suspect was Koseki Bijou, and so the two brought her to the tavern for interrogation. Their reasoning was simple—only those within Gonathon’s guild could have modified the statue, and Bijou was his guildmate.

Elizabeth, being the strict knight and motherly figure that she was, didn’t relent in her questioning.

The princess, however, rejected the accusation outright, and Elizabeth even turned her interrogation on Gonathon [himself](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared\&t=2011). Of course, why would he do such a thing?

Then, an offhand remark was made about Elizabeth possibly being hexed by Nerissa, the "witch," hinting that she wasn’t as uptight as she let on. Gonathon’s trust in the knight wavered, and, feeling betrayed, he stormed out of the [tavern](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared\&t=2066). Well, so much for alliances.

It was mostly an overreaction, though. The two of them did, in fact, trust each other—Gonathon respected Elizabeth’s willingness to help others, and Elizabeth, in return, respected the orange knight for his unwavering loyalty to his beloveds.

Later, when Elizabeth learned that Gonathon’s wife had forgotten about him, she approached him, asking if he was okay and offering her [condolences](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared\&t=9171).

Truly an unexpected alliance.
