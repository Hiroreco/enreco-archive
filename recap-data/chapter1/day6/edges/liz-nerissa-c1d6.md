<!-- title: I'm Pregnant! -->

Nerissa got cooked. Literally. How it happened wasn’t all that important—what mattered was the ridiculous series of events leading up to it.

Nerissa had long been accused of being a witch, mostly by Elizabeth, and everyone knew it. But when the blue maiden somehow knew details about conversations Elizabeth had with others without even being there, the red knight’s suspicions only grew stronger. Their usual back-and-forth escalated, as it often did, until things took a very bizarre turn.

Somehow, Nerissa ended up "pregnant" with Elizabeth’s child. To prove it, she cracked open a chicken egg, and, sure enough, a chick popped out. She used this as undeniable evidence, insisting that Elizabeth had to take responsibility. She clung to the scarlet knight, pestering her nonstop just to grab her attention.

Kiara, who had been standing by, watching the absurdity unfold, clearly wasn’t having any of it. Tired of Nerissa’s nonsense, she simply unsheathed her sword, swung it down, and cooked the "child" on the spot.

Horrified, Nerissa ran off to report the heinous crime to the others, accusing Kiara of murder. She argued that, as a bird, of course, she would lay eggs, and therefore, her child was legitimate. She demanded that Kiara be put on trial, that justice be served, and that reparations be made.

So, Kiara cooked Nerissa [too](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared\&t=2898).

Elizabeth, for her part, didn’t think much of it. That was until she got a call from [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared\&t=4894). "Nerissa’s dead," he told her. "She’s a ghost now." Startled, she immediately dialed Nerissa’s number, and sure enough, the blue maiden—now ghostly—answered.

"Elizabeth," said Ghost Nerissa solemnly, "avenge me. Slay Kiara in my name." (slightly overdramatized)

Elizabeth hesitated. For a moment, she actually considered it. Kiara had quite literally roasted someone alive—justice seemed warranted.

But then she saw Kiara, absolutely glowing with excitement about her upcoming tournament. And just like that, she abandoned the whole vengeance idea entirely.
