<!-- title: Sisters -->

Ina found the slow spread of corruption increasingly unsettling. At first, she brushed it off as a minor nuisance, but as it grew more rampant, she could no longer ignore it. She wanted to find its source, to put an end to it before it got out of hand—but she didn’t have to search for long. The source came to her.

Koseki Bijou, Ina’s sister, approached her with a confession. It was she who had been spreading the corruption, and in doing so, she had come to the realization that she was the Stain Princess. With unwavering conviction, Bijou urged Ina to join her, to stand by her side, and together, they would plunge the kingdom into darkness.

Ina was stunned. Shocked that her own sister—her sweet, innocent Bijou—would say such things. No, this wasn’t her sister speaking. It couldn’t be. Something—no, someone—must have tainted her, twisted her mind, and made her believe such nonsense. But whether she was being controlled or not, the corruption had to be stopped before it was too late. And if it came down to it, if there was no other way… Ina swore she would not hesitate to bring her own sister down.

She took out her anger on the creeping [Stains](https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared&t=5066), destroying them as if doing so would somehow free Bijou from their grasp. But no amount of venting could bring her sister back. Ina needed a plan.

She sought counsel from two of her fellow heroes, Gonathon and Kiara, explaining the dire [situation](https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared&t=7676). Their primary goal would be to sever the connection between Bijou and the Stain. Kiara, ever direct, suggested a drastic measure—beheading Bijou outright. But Ina refused to believe that was the only way.

Then, she remembered something—a tale of a legendary golden apple, said to possess the power to purge corruption. If she could obtain it, she could disguise its effects in a drink and trick Bijou into consuming it. A milkshake, perhaps. After all, Ina had learned that Bijou loved milkshakes.

With a newfound sense of determination, Ina steeled herself for the coming days. A battle lay ahead—not just against the corruption, but for the very soul of her sister.
