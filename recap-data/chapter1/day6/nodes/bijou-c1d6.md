<!-- title: Koseki Bijou -->

Corruption. It was all Bijou could think about. This sinister side of her hadn’t surfaced since she joined the kingdom—until she donned the hat. A seemingly innocuous accessory, the hat resembled a Stain, but this resemblance was no coincidence. It wasn’t just a symbol; it was alive. The Stain atop her head began to take over her mind and actions.

Unconsciously, Bijou started placing [corrupted blocks](https://www.youtube.com/live/8frv4avuyl8?feature=shared&t=456) within her guild's area. Each time, she gasped in shock, as though unaware of her actions. The corruption seemed to act on its own, spreading without her conscious intent.

She claimed she was no longer Raora’s daughter nor a subject of Tam Gandr. She was the Stain Princess, the harbinger of ruin. With [Joe](https://www.youtube.com/live/8frv4avuyl8?feature=shared&t=519)’s influence, she vowed to set the kingdom ablaze and bring chaos to the lands.

For now, her influence was too weak. She had to stay under the radar to avoid detection until she grew stronger. Bijou joined Kiara, Raora, Gonathon, and Nerissa in the Ancient Sewer Dungeon, masking her true intentions. However, her guildmate Gonathon, ever observant, noticed something was [amiss](https://www.youtube.com/live/8frv4avuyl8?feature=shared&t=4630). He confronted Bijou, asking her to remove her hat. Bijou deflected, blaming a "full inventory" for her refusal. Her clever evasion only deepened Gonathon's suspicions.

Later, Bijou faced interrogation by Elizabeth and Gonathon regarding the defacing of the queen's statue. As the primary suspect—and rightly so—Bijou used her cunning to feign innocence. With tears and an air of vulnerability, she convinced them she wasn’t responsible.

However, the corruption’s presence was becoming harder to ignore. It occupied a corner of the Cerulean Cup area, its muddy blocks, withered trees, and ominous aura making it stand out. Signs with foreboding phrases like "Darkness is approaching" heightened the unease. As suspicions grew, Bijou made a bold move: she abruptly removed her hat. With a snap, her memories of the day vanished, leaving her seemingly innocent. Her clever gambit erased any doubt from the minds of her accusers.

Consumed by evil—or perhaps just mischief—Bijou decided to [torment](https://www.youtube.com/live/8frv4avuyl8?feature=shared&t=11633) her sister Ina. She blasted Ina’s song, Violet, right next to her. Whether it was an act of malice or simply a prank, it unnerved the purple priestess. Later, Bijou and Ina had a heart-to-heart conversation. It was then that Bijou revealed the truth of her corruption (see [Bijou-Ina: Sisters](#edge:bijou-ina)).

Toward the end of the day, after participating in the tournament, Bijou confided in Frieda Adams Antoinette Senior. She unveiled her identity as the Stain Princess and shared her plans to take over the kingdom. To her delight, Frieda knelt before her, pledging loyalty and offering to aid in her conquest... but Bijou’s excitement was short-lived; Frieda quickly revealed she was tricking her. The owl lady declared her intention to defeat Bijou and become a hero herself.

Nonetheless, the seeds of chaos had been sown, and she would see her plans to fruition—no matter the cost.
