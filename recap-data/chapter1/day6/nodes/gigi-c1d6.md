Gonathon awoke to his sixth day, only to be greeted by a sight that filled him with rage and despair—his queen’s statue, the one he had painstakingly worked on for days, had been defaced. This wasn’t just vandalism; it was blasphemy against his guiding light, Queen Tam Gandr. Determined to uncover the culprit, Gonathon vowed to bring them to justice.

Before he could delve into the mystery, Gonathon joined Kiara, Raora, Nerissa, and Bijou to aid their expedition into the Ancient Sewer Dungeon. Along the way, most members expressed their loyalty and reverence for [Queen Tam](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=442), though Nerissa made a cheeky comment about how the statue’s depiction of Tam lacked a bit of "cake."

Returning to the kingdom, Gonathon resumed his investigation. Within his guild’s territory, he discovered something alarming—corrupted blocks had appeared in a corner of the land, accompanied by a sinister sign that read: [_"May chaos take the world."_](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=1759) This discovery only deepened the mystery, and Gonathon began to piece together the puzzle.

Given that only guild members could build on his land, suspicion naturally fell on his peers. Queen Tam was above reproach, and Ina wasn’t the type for such antics. This left two potential suspects: the Hot Pink One and Koseki Bijou. The latter’s behavior had been peculiar lately, and her hat—a strange, Stain-like accessory—only added to Gonathon’s unease.

Seeking answers, Gonathon confronted Bijou and requested that she remove the hat to prove it was merely an accessory. To his frustration, Bijou refused, offering a litany of excuses that only fueled his suspicions.

Realizing he couldn’t solve this alone, Gonathon reluctantly sought help from Elizabeth. Despite their occasional clashes, he knew she was resourceful and could aid in uncovering the truth (see [Gonathon-Elizabeth: Unexpected Alliance](#edge:liz-gigi)).

The day was far from uneventful. Gonathon found himself embroiled in various occurrences, from witnessing the peculiar romance between Elizabeth and Nerissa to participating in an impromptu dueling tournament. Yet through it all, two traits of Gonathon shone brightly: his unwavering loyalty and his readiness to assist others.

He helped Kiara [enchant](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=5674) her tools and mediated between Nerissa and Kiara after a dramatic incident involving the alleged "death" of Nerissa’s [child](https://www.youtube.com/live/oygFzGlMT28?feature=shared&t=4296).

But his most profound devotion was reserved for two figures: his queen, Tam Gandr, whom he would gladly defend against naysayers, and his wife, Jyonathan—the pearl of his life. Gonathon’s love for Jyonathan was so deep that he dreamt of erecting a statue in her honor beside Tam’s, a testament to his devotion and desire to make her happy. Yes, anything to make his beloved happy.

......

Back on his fourth day, Gonathon had feared that when his wife regained her memories as Amelia Watson, she would forget their shared life and love.

That fear became reality.

When he greeted her later on, the blonde maiden had no recollection of her dear husband.

With his queen on an expedition, his guildmate under suspicion of corruption, and his beloved lost to memory, Gonathon’s burdens were heavy.

Yet, he resolved to press on, undeterred by the challenges before him (see [Gonathon-Amelia Watson: A Knight's Tale](#edge:gigi-ame)).
