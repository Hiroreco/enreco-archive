The words of the king echoed in Elizabeth's mind as she began her sixth day in the kingdom: "Tis the calm before the storm, and something more terrible is brewing as we speak," "Train your combat skills, and stock up any items you might need," "This may be your last chance, so make the most of it."

[*"The calm before the storm"*](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/embed/5R01-igo4sM?si=4btPS_yE7In0DRPe&start=324)

From what Elizabeth knew, they had one day left before *"the end."* A final battle against some great force loomed ahead, and the aftermath was uncertain. But for Elizabeth, the focus was on the present—making the most of their time and preparing for what was to come.

Upon joining the kingdom, Elizabeth noticed a missed call from Gonathon. She called him back, and he requested a private conversation. Given how rare one-on-one interactions with the knight were, Elizabeth couldn’t resist teasing him a little.

Yet as she listened, Elizabeth saw something in Gonathon she hadn’t fully appreciated before. His unwavering loyalty to his queen and his dedication moved her, and she made a surprising decision: she offered him her blade (see [Elizabeth-Gonathon: Unexpected Alliance](#edge:liz-gigi)).

Of course, a serious moment with Elizabeth wouldn’t be complete without her usual shenanigans with Nerissa. Today’s antics somehow managed to outshine even the chaos of the fifth day. They involved hexing, marriages, and… childbirth? (See [Elizabeth-Nerissa: I'm Pregnant!](#edge:liz-nerissa))

After their mischief, Elizabeth refocused on the king’s words about preparation. Inspired, she came up with the idea to organize a tournament. It would be a chance for everyone to train, test, and hone their swordsmanship.

She reached out to those who weren’t present for the announcement. Her most amusing call was to Ina, which started as a [prank call](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=4264) but ended with Elizabeth being pranked in return.

With about an hour left before the tournament, Elizabeth spent her time completing quests, gathering coins, and, naturally, poking fun at the "worm queen" [statue](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=3219). She also tried nudging Gonathon and his pearl’s relationship forward, at the same time getting hit by [horses](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=5545) during her escapades. For Elizabeth, this day felt like a "filler episode"—a break after completing all the dungeons.

The tournament proceeded, with Gonathon emerging as the champion. Frieda made it far, but her loss to Kiara left her [fuming](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=10272). Elizabeth, ever the instigator, awarded Frieda a [booby prize](https://www.youtube.com/live/5R01-igo4sM?feature=shared&t=10304)—a small consolation for her defeat (not that kind of booby, get your head out of the gutter).

As the day came to an end, Elizabeth reflected on what felt like a lighthearted interlude in the grand scheme of things. Little did she know, beneath the surface of their actions and laughter, something terrible was brewing—a storm unlike anything they’d faced before.
