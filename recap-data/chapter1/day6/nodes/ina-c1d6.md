Ina’s sixth day in the kingdom started with an unusual wake-up call—a prank from Elizabeth about horse and cart insurance. Elizabeth spun a story that would trick most, but Ina wasn’t just any listener; she was five steps ahead. Using her quick wit, she turned the tables on Elizabeth, diffusing the prank with ease.

The call wasn’t entirely frivolous, though. Elizabeth also informed Ina of a tournament set to take place in a few hours, giving her time to prepare. Before that, however, Ina joined Jyonathan, Kiara, and Frieda Adams Antoinette Senior for an expedition into the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon*. There, they recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared\&t=3719) of *Amelia Watson*, revealing that Jyonathan had been Amelia all along.

Upon returning to the kingdom, Ina encountered Gonathon, who sought her insight regarding his wife. He asked if Amelia, after regaining her memories, had mentioned him. Just as Ina began to respond, a tune filled the air—a familiar one emanating from the Moai statue. It was her voice from the past, and the sound was too much for the purple priestess, and she fled the scene.

Later, Ina’s mischievous streak resurfaced as she stumbled upon a conversation between Elizabeth and Bijou. Bijou had been acting strangely, and though Ina was concerned for her sister, the moment was too tempting to resist. Channeling her inner cicada, Ina began making noises to prank the duo.

Afterward, Ina confronted Bijou directly. What she discovered was chilling: Bijou wasn’t just acting odd; she had become corrupted (see Ina-Bijou: Corrupted for details). This revelation weighed heavily on Ina’s heart. She knew she needed to act but decided to hold off until she could investigate further (see [Bijou-Ina: Sisters](#edge:bijou-ina)).

The tournament awaited, and Ina participated in the duels. Though she was defeated by Gonathon, she remained proud of her guildmate, who advanced to [victory](https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared\&t=7150). Still, her joy was tempered by the somber reality of Gonathon’s struggles. His wife, Amelia, had [forgotten him](https://www.youtube.com/live/3zaM1QIff9U?feature=shared\&t=7730). Despite this, Gonathon focused on a greater threat—Bijou, or as she now called herself, the *Stain Princess*, who was believed to be possessed by a sinister force.

Ina knew she couldn’t stand idly by. Though she resolved to stop her sister if it came to that, she also recalled an ancient tale of a golden apple said to cure corruption. It was a faint glimmer of hope, but Ina clung to it. She would do whatever it took to find the apple and save her sister.
