The sixth day was shaping up to be as chaotic as ever, and Jyonathan mostly stood on the sidelines, witnessing the madness: Nerissa hexing Elizabeth, talk of the Stain Princess, a discussion about Nerissa’s child being "murdered," and then a tournament being announced. It was overwhelming, but she found herself enjoying the energy of it all.

As someone who enjoyed a bit of mischief, she decided to add her own flair to the chaos. She investigated Bijou, suspecting her of [corruption](https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?feature=shared\&t=1496), tried her luck at [gambling](https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?feature=shared\&t=2378), and even stood atop the king's throne, roleplaying as the new ruler of the kingdom.

Through all of this, her husband, Gonathon, was always by her side, ensuring her safety and happiness. Jyonathan couldn’t help but feel grateful for having such a devoted companion.

Later, she teamed up with Kiara, Ina, and Frieda Adams Antoinette Senior to explore the Ancient Sewer Dungeon. The setting—a sewer—was unusual, but the adventurers were motivated by the promise of recovering more pieces of their lost memories at the end of the quest.

The dungeon’s challenges were unique, focusing on trivia and riddles about their journey so far. Questions revolved around previous dungeons, the memories recovered, and individuals like Mori Calliope, Gawr Gura, Ninomae Ina’nis, and Takanashi Kiara. Correct answers allowed them to proceed, while wrong answers brought [punishment](https://www.youtube.com/live/i7g-HJMqZ_E?feature=shared\&t=4148).

There was lore about the four girls and a tease of the fifth, described through multiple iterations: a blonde girl building machines in one account and playing video games in another. As they reached the dungeon’s end, the truth revealed itself.

Jyonathan remembered everything now. Her name wasn’t Jyonathan—it was Amelia Watson, the brilliant detective and close friend of the four girls. The revelation felt like a burden lifted off her shoulders. Amelia had always been herself: mischievous, friendly, and curious. The rediscovery of her identity didn’t diminish her joy or the fun persona she’d embraced in this kingdom—it amplified it.

Returning to the kingdom, Amelia was greeted warmly by her companions, who congratulated her on reclaiming her memories. She resolved to continue being the lively, mischievous person she had grown into, cherishing her journey so far.

However, something nagged at her. Her "chatterbox" kept mentioning odd words: *"Husband," "Gonathon," "Pearl".* The terms were foreign to her, but they seemed significant.

Before she could make sense of it, a knight clad in orange approached her, congratulating her like the others. Amelia, likewise, thanked the knight for his generosity.

But she didn't know who this knight was.

She smiled at the knight, and asked,

*"And you are?"*
