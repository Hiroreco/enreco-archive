Fauna began her day with fantastic news: Nerissa, her reliable employee (and also the one who had initially landed her business in trouble), had resolved the Mococo lawsuit [fiasco](https://www.youtube.com/live/j4AxXzluEWE?feature=shared\&t=88). A heavy burden was lifted off her shoulders, leaving her free to focus on her primary objective: building her dream library.

Her vision for the library was clear. It would follow the theme of the Scarlet Wand, radiating elegance and mystique. Inspired by the impressive buildings in the kingdom—especially the monumental Tam Gandr statue Gonathon was constructing—Fauna decided to relocate her library to a more central and grand location. She wanted it to be a hub for knowledge and creativity, a place that stood out in the bustling kingdom.

Construction began with Nerissa as her trusted assistant. Nerissa proved invaluable, tirelessly collecting materials, managing sales, and delivering the results back to Fauna. Despite her earlier missteps as an employee, Nerissa had always been there for Fauna, and her dedication didn’t go unnoticed. Fauna appreciated her efforts and companionship.

After a productive building session, it was time for the daily lottery pull! The winning number was [639](https://www.youtube.com/live/j4AxXzluEWE?feature=shared\&t=7232), but, to everyone’s surprise, there were no winners this time. The jackpot rolled over, growing even larger and adding to the excitement for the next draw.

Returning to her project, Fauna laid out her plans for the library. It would be open to all books, including a special corner dedicated to fanfics. She envisioned it as a place where creativity could thrive, no matter the genre or style.

The red-hued library stood tall, its three floors connected by an elegant spiral staircase, mirroring the distinctive shape of the Scarlet Wand’s hat from the outside. The ground floor housed an extensive collection of books, neatly arranged on towering mahogany shelves. The flooring, made of polished quartz, gleamed under the gentle glow of warm ambient lighting, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere—the perfect space for reading and quiet contemplation.

Unlike the others in the kingdom, Fauna’s day was relatively quiet and focused. While others dove into chaotic and often absurd shenanigans, Fauna regretted not getting involved in the action. However, she held onto the hope that more exciting adventures and interactions would come her way soon.

For now, her library was her priority, and she poured her heart into every brick and shelf, confident that her vision would soon come to life.
