Shakira had been absent for some time and was behind on the kingdom’s adventures. Determined to catch up, she dove straight into the Eldritch Horror Dungeon with Nerissa and Raora, recovering fragments of Ninomae Ina’nis’ [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/3cr3DLpyB60?feature=shared\&t=2640) along the way. Still energized, the trio pressed on to the Volcanic Dungeon, ready to face its fiery trials.

The Volcanic Dungeon lived up to its name. Lava flowed freely, fire burned everywhere, and each step seemed to trigger traps, sending the adventurers plummeting into the molten pools below. While frustrating, the dungeon held deeper meaning for Shakira. Every fall was followed by a rise, symbolizing rebirth and an unyielding will to persevere.

Yet, the dungeon’s theme didn’t match the tone of its lore. The story unfolded around a knight with an obsession for burgers at a certain fast-food joint. It was oddly comedic amid the danger. At the dungeon’s climax, the group encountered a massive goddess-like statue surrounded by orbiting orbs that fired beams of fire. To defeat it, the adventurers had to leap across treacherous platforms to destroy the statue. It was a trial of patience and determination, but Shakira succeeded.

The truth was revealed: Shakira wasn’t her real name. She was *Takanashi Kiara*, the mighty phoenix knight. A leader of armies, a being of rebirth, and, oddly enough, a fast-food restaurant owner who once resurrected a failing burger chain. Kiara found the latter detail amusingly absurd compared to her grandeur but accepted it with grace.

With the dungeons behind her, Kiara returned to the kingdom, eager to dive into its chaos. When she noticed Nerissa pushing an unwanted marriage onto Elizabeth, someone Kiara deeply cared for, she decided to intervene. Nerissa’s claim of being pregnant with Elizabeth’s child led Kiara to propose an utterly bizarre solution: having Nerissa [*"pee on redstone to see if it turned green."*](https://www.youtube.com/live/3cr3DLpyB60?feature=shared\&t=13378) It was nonsensical but effectively confused Nerissa.

The absurdity didn’t stop there. Nerissa claimed a baby chicken as proof of her and Elizabeth’s child. At this, Kiara decided to end the charade. Drawing her sword, she cooked the baby chicken, literally, firmly putting an end to Nerissa’s antics. For good measure, Kiara also slayed Nerissa herself, brushing off the events as if nothing had happened (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: I'm Pregnant!](#edge:liz-nerissa))

Later, Kiara joined Jyonathan, Ina, and Frieda Adams Antoinette Senior in their conquest of the *Ancient Sewer Dungeon* and recovered [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/3cr3DLpyB60?feature=shared\&t=10767) of someone she held near and dear—*Amelia Watson* (though Kiara couldn't help but express her disappointment when her entire mythical existence had been reduced to a *borgur lady*).

To cap off the day, she participated in Elizabeth’s tournament. The competition was fierce, with the final battle between her and Gonathon becoming an epic showdown. The stakes were high, and the outcome would determine the ultimate champion. However, winning was only part of the story, as Kiara's true intention for wanting victory was much more special (see [Kiara-Gonathon: The Oranges](#edge:kiara-gigi)).
