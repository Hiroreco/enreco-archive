## Day 6: The Filler Episode

The day kicked off with Gonathon launching an investigation to uncover the culprit behind the defacement of his queen’s statue.

Meanwhile, Nerissa and Elizabeth were back at it again—flirting, bickering, and generally causing a ruckus. This time, however, things escalated just a bit further. Nerissa boldly claimed she was pregnant with Elizabeth’s child, though neither she nor her so-called "child" lasted long. Kiara swiftly took matters into her own hands, disposing of both, straight-up cooking them.

Later in the day, Elizabeth took charge by organizing a tournament for everyone to participate in. It was a chance to sharpen their swordsmanship and prepare for the inevitable final showdown.

Fauna also finally completed the long-promised library her business had pledged to build since opening. A long-overdue promise fulfilled at last.

But on the darker side of things, Bijou made a chilling revelation. The hat she always wore—the Stain Hat—wasn’t just for decoration. The Stain was alive. It had been controlling her all along, and with this newfound awareness, she declared herself The Stain Princess and began plotting her takeover of the kingdom.

Adding to angsty atmosphere was the most heartbreaking moment since the start of this journey. The ever-strong bond between Gonathon and Jyonathan was shattered—not out of hatred, but something far worse. Jyonathan regained the memories of her past self, but in doing so, she lost the memories of her current one—forgetting everything about the life she had built and, most painfully, forgetting Gonathon. The love they once shared, now reduced to nothing more than a one-sided tragedy.
