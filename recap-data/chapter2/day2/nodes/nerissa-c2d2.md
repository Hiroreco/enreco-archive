Sometimes, career plans fall through, and cracks begin to form, revealing the grim outlook of the industry we've dedicated our craft to. Competition breeds cutthroat survival tactics, and it's clear that if we keep undercutting each other's prices like this, we'll never turn a profit!

Nerissa's cooking skills had surpassed many within Libestal, and she created nothing but impactful Gourmet cuisine from even the most simple of ingredients. She even built a charming Glowstone path to her establishment, so why was nobody coming?

These downcast thoughts had to be shelved for now — Nerissa's current focus was on readying her arsenal before today's primary assignment. "Are there even any Smiths online at the moment (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: The Fumbler](#edge:liz-nerissa-right-2-left-2))"

In the midst of trying to crash the butter market, Nerissa encountered a fellow struggling Chef. Recognizing the risks of remaining in their roles, they discussed the structures of other local job sectors, leading to an epiphany about disrupting Libestal's food commerce (see [Hot Pink One–Nerissa: Chef Union](#edge:irys-nerissa-bottom-2-top-2)).

One upside to having a shop so close to the local Jewelers' stand is that you always happen to catch wind of their latest NDA schemes. Are they planning to [sell bad Charms](https://youtu.be/5sWjzbacGUY?t=7118s)?

As parties began rallying, the Nibs and Nobs saw a slight uptick in sales, however little revenue it accrued. Nerissa wasn't heavily concerned with profits at that moment, for blessings should be shared with [those you fight alongside](https://youtu.be/5sWjzbacGUY?t=8240s), free of charge!

Enlightenment! Some of Nerissa's lost memories had descended, and she managed to remember fuzzy details about [her past in the future](https://youtu.be/5sWjzbacGUY?t=12122s)? Well, it didn't sound like she could recall her name among all that, what a shame.

With newly-gained knowledge in cookery, Nerissa should've been happy to introduce more variety to her menu, if not for the fact that the new dishes are even more tedious to produce! At least the milkshakes were a charming bargaining chip, no [alcohol](https://youtu.be/5sWjzbacGUY?t=15658s) required.
