Elizabeth didn’t want to forget. With so many of her comrades having lost their memories due to the effects of time travel, even if they couldn't remember her, she at least wanted to remember them—for their sake, and for her own.

In the previous journey, fragments of past adventures would surface in Elizabeth’s mind as fleeting images, but now things were clearer. To preserve the memories of her journey, her feelings, she chose to commit them to paper.

Jade Sword, knight of honor and chivalry—those were still the principles the red-clad knight held close. Even in a new land, under a different ruler, and surrounded by those who might have forgotten her, her sense of duty, her honor, and her role as one of the "Shining Stars" kept her moving forward.

With that resolve, she began her new day, signing her letter as the scarlet knight she was: Elizabeth ~~Romeo~~ Rose Bloodflame (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: The Fumbler](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

She had two goals for the day: actually do her job as a smith, and tackle the Star Site: Elpis Dungeon. The former came easily—she jumped straight into upgrading her weapon, which turned out to be much simpler than she’d anticipated. The latter, though, presented a different challenge—not in difficulty, but in deciding who to enter the dungeon with.

Fortunately, that question was soon answered. While helping Nerissa upgrade her weapon, the songstress invited her—along with Cecilia and Fuwawa—to take on the dungeon together.

In the meantime, Elizabeth took on some quests—because, frankly, she was broke. During this, she shared a... let’s say *interesting* exchange with Cecilia. Friendly? Maybe. Quirky? Definitely. The lady in green was far weirder than Elizabeth remembered (see [Elizabeth-Cecilia: Are You Okay?](#edge:cecilia-liz)).

Later, the team entered the [dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=RswqYsQvMw0bMKm5&t=4650). It was packed with puzzles and demanded teamwork to succeed, but after many—*many many many*—falls, they finally triumphed over the boss and recovered IRyS’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=zwOuOP18N9MN1rsA&t=7953).

Afterward, Elizabeth resumed her smithing duties. And yet, despite all the effort, she somehow remained flat-out poor. So, a bit exhausted and more than a little defeated, she turned to what any righteous knight would do in their downtime: prank people.

Toward the end of the day, she joined Kiara and Shiori to explore the Stronghold of Ruin, capturing cinematic shots of the [stunning scenery](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=P3mmCuJ4ecTixSHu&t=13604)—a peaceful close to a long and eventful day.
