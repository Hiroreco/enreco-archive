Mococo woke up and chose violence.

It was on-brand for her, so no one batted an eye anymore—but it certainly set the tone for a lively day for the money-hungry doggo.

Early in the day, Mococo was given a tour of Bijou’s new [gacha business](https://www.youtube.com/live/xLWZay9gLBY?si=Wkgan2DawciAuI33&t=956), gifting her yet another perfect opportunity to throw her savings into games governed entirely by luck. She then joined the same jewel lady, along with Calli, Kiara, and Roa, to take on the [Star Site: Elpis Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/xLWZay9gLBY?si=m3k-9BurPYq6EIT2&t=1878), where they successfully recovered the memories of a certain alcoholic lady named [IRyS](https://www.youtube.com/live/xLWZay9gLBY?si=3qhJPqxuHOK_tvwQ&t=3990).

Afterward, the jeweler went off to the newly opened mines, full of glittering resources just waiting to be claimed. As for Mococo—money, profits, gains—those were the [only things](https://www.youtube.com/live/xLWZay9gLBY?si=l5QVdYqULsj7TfAH&t=4993) that mattered to her. Unlike her sister, who would do anything for others, Mococo would do anything for herself (and her boss’ store, Gacharm, of course... probably).

The contrast between the two sisters ran deeper than just ideology. While Fuwawa quietly spent the majority of her day working alone, Mococo was constantly surrounded by interaction. She called a random bystander [suspicious](https://www.youtube.com/live/xLWZay9gLBY?si=vAnIIU64NtB2I7xh&t=6183) for no reason, bartered and traded, and got help whenever something was beyond her means.

So, with so many pleasant encounters throughout the day, it made perfect sense that Mococo would journal in her diary... not about heartfelt moments or personal growth, but about how many sales she made and her ambitious plans for economic domination.
