Bae couldn't help but gasp at the shops that now surrounded her; what was an empty lot was now the start of a small bustling town as everyone started to build their shop. The former Princess Bijou from the Gacharms Shop nearby greets Bae, and after a pleasant conversation, opens up the idea of possibly purchasing some of Bae's wares to be included in their gacha. 

Inspired, Bae decides to set up her own—a knickknack shop to sell items she had found whilst being poor to include a double service of sorts: with every purchase, customers can get a free enhancement! With that in mind, Bae quickly used her construction box to gather mud, for it is the best-suited material for a peasant-owned shop, and acacia leaves... of which was vaguely familiar. 

Soon, she is astounded by the gold she now has. Perhaps a hero's life is not a bad one.

She met Nerissa, one of the chefs who opened a restaurant, and is intrigued by the food being sold. The best potato salad? Likewise, Bae advertised her shop, and hopefully, there might be [more business](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=1125) between the two in the future.

Bae ponders about her business—how much lapis lazuli would she need to do a full enhancement? The answer escapes her as, unfortunately, being poor left much to be desired of Bae's math skills, but fortunately, the voices in her head helped her and even suggested a fitting name for the shop: [tHE dUMPSTER!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=1764). The Peasant The Bae's tHE dUMPSTER: Where one man's trash is another's treasure!

Soon after, she meets the Hot Pink One again and begins boasting of her shop that will, one day, have things to sell and with it, a free enhancement. Afterward, Bae seeks Bijou's advice about the emeralds she collected and ultimately manages to sell a stack (plus 5 extra) for 100 gold. Ina too later would be The Bae's first official customer as Bae would upgrade [~~scam~~](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=2714) Ina's pickaxe for 100 gold.

With newfound confidence and more materials gathered for The Dumpster, Bae began filling the empty lot bit by bit. To commemorate the event, she would name her beloved pickaxe and axe PP and PA, respectively, and then... buy more gacha for the [building materials, of course!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=3602). No regrets were had, clearly.

But then, Bae remembers her goal: to recover their memories. With a steady breath, she makes amends with the Hot Pink One and joins her, the Consort, and Shiori to tackle the Elpis Dungeon, where their teamwork and trust are put to the test. [Multiple times](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=6308). As the Elpis dungeon boss falls before our heroes, the Hot Pink One remembers who she was. Soon after the quest was done, they reported back to the Princess and, then Fia learned that the Outlander was indeed a hero and was investigating the Stronghold of Ruins.

Now that Bae has gotten stronger, so have the Stains, and at her current level—defeat is all too common. She goes on a series of quests to improve her equipment, and at last [Bae The Peasant is now Bae The Peasant with GOLD!](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=9443). But, with a price, her beloved PP axe would be mistakenly traded off. However, it was quickly replaced.

Another thing was amiss, in Bae's staying true to her peasant nature, Bae had unknowingly slighted Cecilia Immerkind. Never fear, for in the end drinks were had with celebration, the hatchet was buried, and the two made up—and perhaps, an [attraction](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=10425) was formed. Though the moment was ruined by the Hot Pink One, the two once again had heated words.

Accomplished and now rich, The Bae would write down in her journals the words of Mother echoing in her thoughts and finish the day.
