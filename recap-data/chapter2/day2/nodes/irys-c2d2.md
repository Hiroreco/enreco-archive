The Pink One had been a chef for one day—and in that one day, she worked her butt off, gathering materials and crafting the most delicious chocolate cakes imaginable, only for [not a single soul](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=Hk_cFQIe4t9Hkm8x&t=485) to bat an eye. It was, understandably, frustrating. Especially when her little brother was already employed by what looked like the kingdom’s biggest business chain, raking in coin by selling much-coveted goods through gacha.

She tried confronting the store owner for "corrupting" her brother—not out of jealousy, of course—but the moment she realized the store sold items she needed, she folded on the spot (see [Hot Pink One–Roa: Pink Union](#edge:irys-raora)).

Given how rough her situation was, she decided to potentially team up with another broke chef struggling to make sales (see [Hot Pink One–Nerissa: Chef Union](#edge:irys-nerissa)).

Back on track—today was a big day for the pink lady. A dungeon had opened, and this one _called_ to her. Not because of its funny name, [Star Site: Elpis](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=kiT67P23j1CsC3Zx&t=3512), but because of the secrets it promised to unveil.

She joined forces with Shiori, Ina, and Bae. The dungeon, floating far above the world, was themed around Angels and Devils. It challenged them with puzzles that required cooperation at opposite ends. Many... _descents_ happened, testing the patience of our heroes—mostly due to the pink one’s inability to tell left from right. After navigating three puzzles, they faced the two-headed dragon: Stain King Elpis. But with the combined strength of the four, they emerged victorious.

And then, the pink one finally remembered who she was.

She wasn’t just a struggling chef trying to sell chocolate cakes—she was IRyS, the Nephilim born of war between Angels and Demons. With her voice, she united both factions, a being people called “a goddess”—albeit an alcoholic one.

Though the revelation was profound, she didn’t change all that much. Maybe she had always been this way.

To celebrate the occasion, she joined Immerkind and the others for a drinking party by the creek, where IRyS’s commentary made many question her divine status (see [Immerkind–IRyS: Classists](#edge:cecilia-irys)).

Brimming with empathy and goodwill, the pink one later lent a hand to her somewhat close friend Tammy, helping her through the same dungeon (see [Tam–IRyS: Sapphire and Lappie](#edge:irys-kronii)).
