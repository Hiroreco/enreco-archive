Shiori woke up to the sight of her chickens disappearing, but she couldn’t figure out why.

She was such a tentative owner who just happened to keep a coop of chickens in a remote location so secret that not even the voices in her head could pinpoint it—just so she could carry out entirely non-suspicious activities. So why would something so cruel happen to her poor little chickens?

Still, what’s gone is gone, and Shiori had other things to focus on. After all, she was running a business—ShiorinEats—delivering food to those in need at (not) very reasonable prices. It didn’t take long for her to make her first sales of the day to Peasant da Bae with a couple of loaves of [bread](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=77RXYlj7fMgVBGrw&t=1075), before joining her, along with Ina and the Hot Pink One, to take on the [Star Site: Elpis Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=ms6YkOl_w5irfv65&t=1195)—the first of many. Upon completing it, the gang managed to recover the memories of the Hot Pink One, who turned out to be [IRyS](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=3wlfWnlh0MU4h_do&t=3808).

With that settled, Shiori returned to building her abode. But by now, her name had spread far and wide, and even if she was doing anything remotely normal, those around her remained [wary](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=jwnA-XIXNucAjI44&t=4991). Especially one she had previously tormented—mentally.

But really, why would anyone be suspicious? She was just a humble delivery girl who maybe tried scamming a poor, broke knight with supposedly discounted [pork chops](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=SU4dNnWgXpyefwAL&t=7050). A girl who openly admitted to stirring up an [evil scheme](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=HuUPchNE8myBcl0m&t=7169). A girl who somehow talked her way into getting a 100-coin [discount](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=G5pZmSU5lSlsfHUC&t=8964). Totally normal behavior.

Anyway, toward the end of the day, Shiori journaled her journey on Day 2—a day where she learned about the quirks of others and witnessed various curious events unfold.

She also gave Gonathon beets, again, for completely [non-suspicious reasons](https://www.youtube.com/live/4dgeXH5KKlI?si=OFSnHhwRpTtRCLr_&t=13186).
