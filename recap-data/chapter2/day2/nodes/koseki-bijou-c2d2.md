Between the two days, Bijou finished building the storefront of the Gacharms shop. She’d devised a system to randomize which charm would be dispensed—using letters to pick a random spot on the display board inside the store.

Bijou was among the first to wake up today, ahead of the dungeon’s grand opening. She spent most of that time gathering crafting materials, constructing the shop’s storage area, and knocking out side quests. All for good reason—she wouldn’t be able to stay around for long.

Her hard work didn’t go unnoticed. Her boss, Roa, gave her something to take on her adventures in return: a little Beast Stain hat! [“A friend?! Wait… a friend?”](https://youtu.be/03m4uWAFfQg?t=4938) Somehow, this seemed oddly familiar to Bijou. Thinking about it made her head ache… but hey, it was friend-shaped. Roa said its name was Bob.

Having given a few folks a tour of her new shop, Bijou teamed up with Roa, Mococo, Kiara, and Gordon to take on the dungeon of the day—[Star Site: Elpis](https://www.youtube.com/live/03m4uWAFfQg?si=v8NPjzKF80d-iANM&t=7792). Upon its completion, the group recovered the memories of [IRyS](https://www.youtube.com/live/03m4uWAFfQg?si=dmDDeTDMq-8PzOVB&t=9908).

Apparently, her brother—the hot pink one, or IRyS now—was a goddess. An alcoholic one, at that. Coincidentally, they ran into each other just after Bijou’s group had finished their conquest. And the very next day would be the gem girl's birthday! Naturally, she reminded her brother the moment she got back from the dungeon. And what did she do? [Forgot](https://youtu.be/03m4uWAFfQg?t=11179). Some brother.

Later, Bijou went back to stocking the shop with new items, working hard so she could ~~scam~~ make her boss proud—grinding, bartering, doing all the things a good employee would.

As the day came to a close, she joined her brother's group by the riverside to drink, both to cool down and to celebrate the upcoming occasion. Was Bijou of age? Who knows. But she had fun, and that’s what mattered.

Shortly after that gathering, Bijou got so drunk she nearly drowned in the river. Then she suddenly passed out and vanished, ending her day just like that.
