Fuwawa woke up and went straight to work. She had to be diligent—only through hard work could she create delicious food, fulfill her role as a chef, and ultimately achieve her dream of bringing people together.

She gathered materials, completed quests, slew Stains, and farmed—her entire morning was devoted to labor and nothing else. Later, she was invited by Nerissa to join Cecilia and Elizabeth in tackling the [Star Site: Elpis Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/a940cWsshj4?si=UY5Oz5F1CLczMmM1&t=2686). It was a tough one—she fell, and fell, and fell again—but in the end, the team pulled through and successfully recovered IRyS’s [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/a940cWsshj4?si=65k58U-GsS7g6zhV&t=5966).

After that, Fuwawa... went right back to work. For nearly the entire day, she was rarely seen with anyone else—not even near her counterpart, Mococo. She remained laser-focused on her dream of cooking for others, knowing that it would take real effort to get there. And it paid off. She earned a small fortune, possibly becoming one of the richest in the kingdom with over 6000 coins. With that much capital, she finally laid the foundation for her very own [shop](https://www.youtube.com/live/a940cWsshj4?si=btIhScSR8a7IJhij&t=11706)—her ultimate goal coming into view.

Everything was going well. She was always doing her best... Yet there was a hint of melancholy. Despite her efforts, she wasn’t part of the shenanigans the others were caught up in. Fuwawa couldn't help but wonder—once her shop was finished, would anyone even come?

Still, the fluffy one had to stay optimistic. Only by holding on to that hope could she bring smiles to others’ faces.
