The job of a Lorekeeper was hard as Kiara and Mordan looked over the journals of our heroes but nonetheless rewarding. Some expressed concern but Kiara gave her honour as a Knight that their privacy will kept.

As Kiara began the side quest to set up her own shop, she calls her beloved (not related) cousin Immerkind and shared moments of kindness with her. Though for a moment they doubted their non-blooded relations but reaffirmed it as they out-kind one another with [flowers](https://youtu.be/R23_uw22SK0?t=2779).

The dungeon soon opened as Kiara would join The Gacharms group and Mordan. Puzzles. It surprised Kiara that stain spawned out of nowhere - this dungeon would prove trickier than the past for it challenges our Knights' intellect, teamwork, and might. But, tricky as it was, it did not matter for Kiara and her companions would face the last trial soon. One where they must fight The Stain King Elpis. The battle was fierce but their experience shines through, defeating Elpis without any [lives lost](https://youtu.be/R23_uw22SK0?t=5662) and recovering the Hot Pink One's history and Fia's memory.

They reported their findings to the Princess, and later Fia, and likewise received key information in turn.About the Outlander and The Outsider. A hero who defended the kingdom but at the cost of creating a greater evil. New areas are now available, piquing Kiara's interest. More materials to gather from and new dungeon to crawl. Another chance to grow stronger.

It was harder than expected, for as Kiara's spirit as a Knight remained steadfast, her enemies are eager to match her in strength. Bijou and Roa would recommend new charms to increase her stats.

Kiara would then show her experience as a business woman as she securing [great sales](https://youtu.be/R23_uw22SK0?t=7392) for her upgrade stones. She would gain more customers, and a more humble fortune, as her experience as a smithy grows, crafting better quality upgrade stones soon after. She too would act as a bodyguard for Mordan as the latter mined precious materials from the new Remnant.

Shortly before writing about adventures today, Kiara as the Lorekeeper would go over [Shiori's](https://youtu.be/R23_uw22SK0?t=14775) finding a small surprise at the end. Satisfied, she expects the next day to be a Legendary one.
