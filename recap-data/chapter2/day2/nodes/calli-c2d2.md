The tavern owner continued renovating her tavern—probably one of the biggest establishments around. It wasn’t just a place to grab a bite; it offered a range of wildly concerning services as well. Thus was the proud creation of Mordan Ramsey.

The place was pink. Pink on all four sides, pink from top to bottom. The roof sparkled with sea lanterns, and the inside was—well, still pink, but a warm, welcoming kind of pink. The main dining area was lined with tables, with sakura petals gently falling from above and a single portrait of the owner hung for all to see. Behind it lay the basement, home to a secret fight club, and above were guest suites of varying classes: Peasant, Knight, and Libestalian King—each with a balcony view of the kingdom’s vast green fields. At this point, it was looking more like a motel than a tavern.

It was beautiful—but not finished. Miss Mordan had more ideas. She later established a [therapy stall](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=cLBaeNYSgM9NfhrZ&t=4070) right next to the tavern: 100 coins for solo sessions, 200 for couples. A chef who could cook, run a motel, and now offer therapy? What _couldn’t_ she do at this point?

She had to do it all, though—the economy was tough, and it was a battlefield for folks like her. Of course, collaboration helped, like the one she had going with [Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=-Az4QRmpYlH1g237&t=2062).

Turning back to the main quest, Mordan teamed up with Kiara, Biboo, Roa, and Mococo for a mission to the [Star Site: Elpis Dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=Mcd8vEwgowdvbG3w&t=6353), where they successfully recovered memories of [IRyS](https://www.youtube.com/live/wu7g7fNsXYk?si=8aHIbG2KX1DFLf3y&t=8501).

Toward the end of the day, she went out to gather more ingredients for cooking. Unfortunately, she ran into a slew of monsters, so she hired a bodyguard—who promptly failed at being a bodyguard. Mordan returned home, only to once again be assaulted by the one person who seemed to be determined to mess with her business just for the fun of it (see [Mordan-Shiori: Please Leave Me Alone](#edge:shiori-calli)).
