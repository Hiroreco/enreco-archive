Cecilia Immerkind wanders about in a dream and meets Cecilia Immergreen who tells her that she must be the [kind one](https://www.youtube.com/live/48HSA_GcOZ0?si=BmXYwLW7t-EgDrVB&t=627). Cecilia wakes up inspired and immediately starts sharing flowers with others to spread kindness (see [Cecilia-Kiara: Marillenkn√∂del and Roses](#edge:cecilia-kiara)).

While wandering, Nerissa Juliet Ravencroft calls Cecilia and invites her to a group with Lady Bloodflame and Fuwawa to explore the Star Site: Elpis. The ever so kind Cecilia boosts the morale of the group by giving one free compliment to her fellow travelers.

Through adversity, they complete daunting puzzles, hordes of stains, and arrive at the end of the dungeon. They valiantly slay the Stain King Elpis and retrieve the dreams of the Hot Pink One (Irys) and share an [emotional ending together](https://www.youtube.com/live/48HSA_GcOZ0?si=72AIHtOd67m6mOTT&t=6367).

Upon returning to the castle, Cecilia is torn with how to [profess her feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48HSA_GcOZ0&t=6610s) to the princess and seeks advice from Lady Bloodflame, Irys, and NinoIna. During this, Irys and NinoIna gather and banter while Irys seeks to recruit Cecilia to become their "Above SC" (see [Cecilia-Irys: Classists](#edge:cecilia-irys)). 

Bae finds her way into the group and Cecilia confronts her and reconciles. This new group of Irys, Bijou, Roa, and Bae travel to the Remnants bridge to share a drink where new feelings start to develop (see [Bae-Cecilia: The Knight and The Hobo](#edge:cecilia-bae)). The stress of feelings and the weight of the world were amplified by the drinks and left Immerkind emotionally vulnerable and seeking companionship.

After sobering up with Nerissa's water and discussions with Iphania and Fia, the newly formed party between Cecilia, Shiori, and Lady Bloodflame [depart to the Stronghold Ruins](https://www.youtube.com/live/48HSA_GcOZ0?si=d7A8Eeu8Mggd-qH5&t=10381). Unfortunately, the Azure Screen of Death left Cecilia weak so she must part ways early to rest.
