<!-- title: NinoIna -->

Awakening from slumber, the Hero browsed the shops for breakfast but found no food that rivaled her etenral consort's cooking.

Ill-suited for business talk this early in the day, NinoIna spent little time in the Jewelers' new Charms shop. She found comfort in her personal space, putting her focus on completing daily obligations and culling the relentless hordes of Stains (and cows).

After a period of preparation, NinoIna accepted Shiori's request to reunite their brief adventure party. She formed a team to investigate the first Star Site alongside two other Shining Stars: the Hero's eternal consort and the gear-enchanting Peasant.

[Star Site: Elpis](https://www.youtube.com/live/NSOuyMjCxPI?si=GRnr9rP-JPIfVj1V&t=4512) was designed to deter explorers like them. NinoIna and her betrothed, though forced apart, stood atop contrasting arenas, guiding each other through the mystical mazes of the stronghold. The Hero did what she knew best to aid her allies, using her valiant strength to protect them from the Stain King's malice.

Learning of her consort's drinking patterns did not waver NinoIna's affection for her, nor the patronage of her baked goods. Wait, did they sign a prenup back in the previous world?

The victory over Stain King Elpis granted NinoIna's party a renewed fighting spirit, and the limits of their potential expanded. With greater expectations though come greater risks; thus an excursion to procure a new gem led to [the Hero's first defeat](https://youtu.be/NSOuyMjCxPI?t=7920s) in ancient Libestan history.

Having overcome many trials, NinoIna painstakingly crafted a special wedding charm for her consort in the image of the Hero's [big red heart](https://youtu.be/NSOuyMjCxPI?t=9590s). Cecilia Immerkind yearned for the closeness they shared with each other, so of course, the Hot Pink One-offered her a trial period as their "Above SC" (Super cute? Super CC?), and she was already cashing in on the therapy benefits.
