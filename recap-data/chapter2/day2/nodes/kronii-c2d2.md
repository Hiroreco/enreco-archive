<!-- title: Tam Gandr -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Tam joined in late, already resigned to her fate. Alone, lonely, all lonesome—no one to go with her, no one to help, no one by her side. She would have to do everything herself: the dungeon, which _required_ multiple people? She'd brave it solo. It was fine. It was her fate—to be alone, to never have company, to suffer for all eterni— Oh, never mind.

Pinky was here (see [Tam–IRyS: Sapphire and Sappie](#edge:irys-kronii)).
