The work of a CEO is never done as Roa, Not Rao or Raora, Pandora made it a point to start her days early to ensure that she and her employees are prepared for success. And truly, Pandora is proud of her employees as she marvels at newly constructed The Gacharms shop [Bijou built](https://youtu.be/i54lsw-XjDA?t=692) and the gacha system they implemented. 

Pandora called Mordan Ramsey for a butter she needed for a quest and is quite pleased by the fair price. Later on, Mordan would advertise her tavern but a potato path would catch Pandora's eyes spies Nerissa's shop at the end. Recalling her shop has the best potato salad, Pandora inquires about it but then found herself caught between the two chefs trying to [out-chef](https://youtu.be/i54lsw-XjDA?t=4654) the other.

Satisifed with the food, Pandora was compelled to give free samples, to both Mordan and Nerissa. Luckily, the voices in her head saved her and she realised  discounts and freebies would be the downfall of her business.

As she ventured out, Pandora noticed how her Revelation is stronger and would only get stronger from here on out. She would be put to the test as she, Mococo, Kiara, Bijou, and Mordan go forth to find their memories in the Elpis Dungeon. Confident at first, Pandora found the puzzles easy but perplexed as they got progressively harder. But the end is simpler for their last trial was the Stain King Elpis themselves! A fierce fight was had but Pandora and her group [clawed](https://youtu.be/i54lsw-XjDA?t=11045) victory from the dragon's jaws of defeat recovered some of their memories - and The Hot Pink One's history.

They reported back to the Princess, then Fia, and discovered key information: The Outlander protected Libestal but also triggered the birth of The Outsider. Newer areas to explore opened, more materials for the shops perhaps, and a Stronghold of Ruin to later explore.

A good work done, Roa shares in the comradery with her fellow heroes as they drank in the castle, under a bridge, and a drink to celebrate Bijou's birthday. [Perhaps a bit too much to drink](https://youtu.be/i54lsw-XjDA?t=15299).

After selling a few charms to Nerissa and Shiori, and ensuring her employees are settled, Pandora marvelled how far she's come and before writing down her profitable adventures and sales to end her day.
