<!-- title: Two Steps Forward, One Drunk Leap Off The Cliff -->

A new day begins but once again Peasant The Bae finds herself in another banter with the Hot Pink One. Small quips about the other's profession to the pink one briefly interrerupting Bae's commission for the Hot Purple One. But perhaps, they got on the wrong foot. Bae would make [ammends](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=3779) and see if both of them could work together in the new dungeon. The Hot Pink One too would confess to Bae that she may change jobs in the future.

There were some [missteps](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=5125) on the way but ultimately, with surprsing teamwork between them (and others) the dungeon was conquered! And their relationship mended and well.

... Until the Hot Pink One relapsed and Bae herself was too poor to experience being drunk. Perhaps it was also due to Cecilia Immerkind falling for the now richer Peasant that the Hot Pink One would wrongly call Bae 'of the Hobo class' that caued [another spat](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=10523).
