<!-- title: Two Steps Forward, One Drunk Leap Off The Cliff -->

A new day begins, but once again, Peasant The Bae finds herself bantering with the Hot Pink One. Small quips about the other's profession to the pink one briefly interrupting Bae's commission for the Hot Purple One. But perhaps they got off on the wrong foot. Bae decides to make [amends](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=3779) and see if both of them could work together in the new dungeon. The Hot Pink One, too, confesses to Bae that she may consider changing jobs in the future.

There are some [missteps](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=5125) on the way, but ultimately, with surprising teamwork between them (and others) the dungeon was conqueredâ€”and their relationship, mended.

... Until the Hot Pink One relapses, and Bae herself was too poor to experience being drunk. Perhaps it was also due to Cecilia Immerkind falling for the now richer Peasant that the Hot Pink One wrongfully calls Bae 'of the Hobo class' that caused [another spat](https://youtu.be/Tiq2wmF-NfQ?t=10523).
