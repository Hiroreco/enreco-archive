<!-- title: Marillenknödel and Roses -->

Upon arriving in the world, Cecilia gave Karia a flower and told a joke about being cousins, [zweiten grades meiner Mutter, dessen Vater, dessen Tochter, dessen Sohn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48HSA_GcOZ0&t=1204s).

Karia asked Cecilia if she had ever had marillenknödel, and Cecilia admitted she had never tasted sweet knödel. Immerkind noted that their ancestry might stem from distant lands, so she proposed a [knödel party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48HSA_GcOZ0&t=734s) to train in the art of making various knödel.

Karia returned and presented Cecilia with a bouquet of [roses, where they shared a sniff](https://www.youtube.com/live/48HSA_GcOZ0?si=sq2yFL6C3s6Xtlga&t=1440) atop the gryphon roost.

...That's a lot of German bonding moments. At the very least, these moments were normal for siblings to have, because although giving a bouquet of roses usually represented a proposal of love, these were cousins; no way one would fall for another... right?
