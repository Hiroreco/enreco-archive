<!-- title: Marillenknödel and Roses -->

Upon arriving in the world, Cecilia gives Karia a flower and tells a joke about being [cousin zweiten grades meiner Mutter, dessen Vater, dessen Tochter, dessen Sohn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48HSA_GcOZ0&t=1204s).

Karia asks Cecilia whether she has had marillenknödel, and Cecilia states that she has never had sweet knödel. Immerkind notes that their ancestry may be from distant lands... so she proposes to have a [knödel party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48HSA_GcOZ0&t=734s) to train in the art of making different knödel.

Karia returns and gives Cecilia a bouquet of [roses, where they share a sniff](https://www.youtube.com/live/48HSA_GcOZ0?si=sq2yFL6C3s6Xtlga&t=1440) on the top of the gryphon roost.
