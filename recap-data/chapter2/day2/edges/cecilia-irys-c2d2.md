<!-- title: Classists -->

Miss Kindest of Kind, Immerkind, was indeed a very kind woman—and also a world-class enabler. Upon learning about IRyS’s growing [alcohol problem](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=pUq6lA_E5OP_5Hkn&t=8066) and how her wife had supposedly put her on a path to rehabilitation, Immerkind, in her infinite wisdom as the pink one’s bestest of friends, made the most _reasonable_ decision: invite her to a drinking party by the creek.

The gathering went just about as you'd expect. Five girls—Bae, Bijou, Roa, Cecilia, and IRyS—each hailing from vastly different corners of society, sat around tipsy and chattering about vital topics such as classism and narcolepsy. You know, typical girl talk.

As time passed and the bottles emptied, the group began to disperse, until only Roa and the two besties remained—completely and utterly drunk.

At this point, Roa, with the full confidence of someone ten drinks deep, decided to walk on water. Like Jesus Christ, if Jesus were a furry.

And, as with the Son of Man himself, the world just wasn’t ready. The two besties—green and pink—banished her on the spot. Immerkind claimed Roa was far too dangerous to remain. As for IRyS? Her reasoning was... well, _questionable_ at best.
