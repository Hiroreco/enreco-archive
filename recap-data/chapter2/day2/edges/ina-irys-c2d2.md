<!-- title: Married, Again -->

Hot Pink was lucky to have Hot Purple.

Hot Purple bought her gifts. Hot Purple showed her love and care. Hot Purple was dependable. Hot Purple gave everything. Meanwhile, Hot Pink... well, she was just on the receiving end—but that didn’t matter. They were in love.

The two had already been married once, and now? They were getting remarried, because why not? One was the brother of Koseki Bijou, the other was the sister of Koseki Bijou, so the two tying the knot again was... well, one important detail: they weren’t blood-related, so it’s [totally fine](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=Fgy4X9B4QkwIu_R2&t=7200).

To seal their eternal bond, the purple one gave her consort a gift—a ring, something like a wedding ring—and then immediately tried to rope in a third party for their SC circle.
