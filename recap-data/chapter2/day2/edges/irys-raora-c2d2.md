<!-- title: Pink Union -->

The pink one was not pleased. Her cakes weren’t selling; they never sold to begin with, and to make things worse, her brother had found employment under what seemed like a shady enterprise, one possibly built on the backs of child labor. Of course, her outrage had _nothing_ to do with jealousy. Not at all. Absolutely not. She just needed to have a stern, civil, and totally not passive-aggressive word with the owner of this “Gacharm” business.

But then she saw the goods being sold. Gacha, but make it _actually_ good? The pink one folded immediately. Her “cheapest cake in town” couldn’t even compete with this well-oiled, sparkly gambling machine. It was a blow to her pride, and her wallet.

Fast forward a bit, and somehow—after a drunken riverside celebration—two pink ladies found themselves welcoming a certain pink dog into their fold. A dog who just happened to be jogging by and got swept up into their nonsense. And thus, the "Pink Union" was born.

Don’t ask how. It just happened.
