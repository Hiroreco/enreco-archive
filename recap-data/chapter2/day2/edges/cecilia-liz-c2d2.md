<!-- title: Are you okay? -->

The green one Elizabeth had once known was smart, composed, and reserved. But the one now? A completely different story. Immerkind... what kind of "kind" are we even talking about here? Would a truly kind person be sniffing around the ruler of the kingdom’s bed? Love their cousins in... [questionable ways](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=CHriNMsPTDxnzLRI&t=3384)? Randomly call Elizabeth a “good girl” and then launch into an impromptu lecture on classism? Yeah—this one’s definitely the weird kind.

Though peculiar in many ways, Elizabeth found herself oddly at ease around Cecilia. There was something in her presence—steady, grounded, warm in an unspoken way. Something about the way she carried herself, the quiet strength behind her words, and the strange, invisible thread that seemed to link them. Not romantically, no—but as comrades. Kindred souls bound by trust, shaped by battles fought side by side, by truths exchanged in silence more than speech.

Elizabeth couldn’t quite explain it, but she trusted Cecilia—fully.

If only Cecilia could feel the same, and not lash out at, you know, the simplest of misunderstandings.
