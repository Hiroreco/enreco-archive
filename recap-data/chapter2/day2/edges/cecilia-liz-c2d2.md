The green one Elizabeth had once known was smart, composed, and reserved. But the one now? A completely different story. Immerkind... what kind of "kind" are we even talking about here? Would a truly kind person be sniffing around the ruler of the kingdom’s bed? Love their cousins in... [questionable ways](https://www.youtube.com/live/wnQuawM-3Jc?si=CHriNMsPTDxnzLRI&t=3384)? Randomly call Elizabeth a “good girl” and then launch into an impromptu lecture on classism? Yeah—this one’s definitely the weird kind.
