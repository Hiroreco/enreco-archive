<!-- title: Sapphire and Lappie -->

Tam—sorry, *Tammy*—had just asked the pink one for help, and already the flirting had begun. *Pinky Pie?* Really? Just because they were the only two people awake in the kingdom at the time didn’t mean they had to be so [*public*](https://www.youtube.com/live/k9ZejRHvNV0?si=5oTVa93vxXbkNRNy&t=719) about it.

The two ventured together into the Star Site: Elpis (after spending a good chunk of time talking about the most random topics imaginable). With Pinky already having cleared the dungeon, she was able to guide Tammy all the way to the end—though not without throwing in eyebrow-raising comments every chance she got. Then came the moment Tammy recovered her [memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/k9ZejRHvNV0?si=dDevj4c-e0YI9T3z&t=4099)—memories of the woman she supposedly had a crush on—and of course, she immediately teased her about it.

The flirty duo later attempted to give each other [nicknames](https://www.youtube.com/live/k9ZejRHvNV0?si=bugka1vug9q7A9yD&t=5020), as if “Tammy” and “Pinky” weren’t already embarrassing enough. Eventually, they landed on “Sapphire” for the blue one and “Sappie” for the pink one.

Were they in love? Well... at least one of them was. As for the pink one, she was—how do we put this—just *weird*. And somehow, Tam found herself head over heels for this eccentric woman who may or may not have a severe case of schizophrenia. But hey, love rarely makes sense.

Later, the two settled down in the library to document their journey. Tam wrote in her journal—[six pages](https://www.youtube.com/live/k9ZejRHvNV0?si=3AKlEPdidPRmd0_z&t=9419), short and concise—about her day with the pink one: the help she received, the quirky antics, the enchanting voice that sang “Lava Chicken,” and the bittersweet feelings she held for someone who was technically already married.

Meanwhile, on the other end of the table... [14 pages](https://www.youtube.com/live/axlJjQQ_rzU?si=0Q2ZcIVH52OhsBcQ&t=26063). A detailed rundown of financial woes, drunken escapades, plans to fatten a cat into a perfectly round loaf, chocolate cakes, egg hunts, chicken scouting—oh, and *one single page* about Tam. 

They ended their day in true chaotic fashion by bullying a fat, talking cat. Naturally.
