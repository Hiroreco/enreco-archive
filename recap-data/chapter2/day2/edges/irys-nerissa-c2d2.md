<!-- title: Chef Union -->

Two chefs, two very different backgrounds—but the same tragic outcome: not a single sale to their names. Dozens of chocolate cakes and vats of potato salad made with love and desperation, only to end up in the trash instead of someone’s stomach. The kingdom’s economy was ruthless, and it hit the culinary world the hardest.

If the world won’t buy from them individually, maybe it would listen to a united front.

And so, the seeds of a chef union were sown—an alliance forged in flour, tears, and fiscal despair. A movement not just to make money, but to prove that their food *deserved* to be eaten.
