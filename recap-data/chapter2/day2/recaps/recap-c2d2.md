## Day 2: Hope, Despair, Hot Pink One

Having settled into their new lives in ancient Libestal, and with their jobs now underway, our heroes quickly got into the swing of things.

That's right—summoned to save the universe from impending calamity, what everyone actually ended up doing was bracing themselves for an all-out simulation of capitalism. A brutal game of market survival, where any tactic, no matter how underhanded, was fair play in the war of commerce. Sabotage, unionization, market manipulation—everything was on the table. From booming startups to lonely chefs tossing out yet another unsold chocolate cake, it was cutthroat, chaotic, and kind of impressive.

Resources were abundant and waiting, as new lands opened up for exploration—offering not just fresh adventures, but also valuable materials ripe for profit.

But beyond the economic battleground, the main quest of the day loomed: the opening of the first dungeon—**Star Site: Elpis**. A place that demanded cooperation to conquer and, in return, would restore the memories of a certain woman clad in hot pink.

And speaking of hot pink, that one was *everywhere* today. Whichever direction you looked, there she was, entangled in yet another wild, unhinged, and somehow meaningful interaction. The web of relationships spun around her only grew more chaotic and expansive by the hour—fitting for a day centered around memories, mishaps, and maybe just a bit of madness.
