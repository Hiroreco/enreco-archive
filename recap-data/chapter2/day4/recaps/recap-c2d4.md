## Day 4: Where Love Waits Between the Hours

Second day in a row where the side event takes the spotlight before the real meat and grit of the main show. At this point, that’s just tradition. Day Four delivered two things: a time lord and a Korean soap opera. Two wildly different beasts—yet somehow, both showed up to the same dinner party.

Early in the day, our heroes zeroed in on the main objective: investigating the second major dungeon, the **Star Site: Chronos**. Here, time reigned supreme—each challenge shackled by ticking timers, counting down as the adventurers scrambled for answers. The theme wasn’t just surface-level either. This dungeon was deeply tied to the memories of a key figure. One that many thought was just a broke, self-declared queen—only to discover she was, in fact, the *Warden of Time* herself.

Alongside that came a game-changing revelation about the mystery of the Outlander, flipping the narrative on its head and solidifying the heroes' purpose: save the world.

But let’s be real.

No one cared about such a frivolous responsibility.

The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy only increases—and if you’ve been following this story, you’d know that law hasn’t missed a single day. Things have only gotten messier since day one.

Gonathon with a G—a knight known for his humility, his generosity, his unwavering care—somehow managed to steal Elizabeth’s crown for the biggest fumble of the season. His performance in today’s love drama was so generational, so chaotic, that comparisons were made. To what? *"A goat being washed."* That's how bad it got.

The knight in orange cooked up a love story so convoluted that most around him either gave up entirely or begged not to be involved. Those unlucky enough to be roped in—yes, even the queen he once served loyally—became collateral damage. Gonathon G? More like *onathon*, because no **G**irls would dare take this person's hands.

Yet, in the eye of the storm, peace still existed.

Elizabeth spent quiet time in her forge, chatting with the voices in her head. Nerissa kept grinding, forever in pursuit of her beloved potato salad. And right in the middle of all the chaos, tucked humbly into the heart of the build zone, there stood a cozy little cafe. A cafe that didn’t chase profit but offered delicious food, handmade with love and fluff. Waiting. Always waiting. Not for gold or fame—but just to make someone smile.
