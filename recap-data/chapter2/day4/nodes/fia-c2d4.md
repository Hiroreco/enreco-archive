Another fragment of memories unfolded before Fia—and with it, a revelation that shook everything to its core.

[The truth about the Outsider](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/wCysZh57Hcc?si=yZOPqpzRsa6KSL3D&t=11331)

The Outlander, the nameless swordsman once hailed as the “hero” destined to save the world, was in truth the one who would bring about the end of the universe. He _was_ the great evil. He _was_ the Outsider.

Fia explained that his original role had never been to save anyone. He was the Watcher—an entity created solely to observe, to remain distant and uninvolved. But when the world teetered on the edge of destruction, the Watcher couldn’t bear to stand idly by. And so, he broke the only rule that bound him, stepping in as the anonymous swordsman in a desperate attempt to help.

The Higher Being, enraged by this defiance, cast the Watcher into eternal imprisonment. The shame. The betrayal. The unjust punishment. All of it festered—until it twisted him into something else entirely. The Watcher became the Outsider, the very force that would one day end the world.

Now, the only hope to change this grim fate is for the heroes—not the nameless swordsman—to rise and take up the burden of saving the world in his place.
