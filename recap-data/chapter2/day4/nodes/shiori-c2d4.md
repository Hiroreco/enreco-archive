Perhaps today would be the day Shiori chose to be forward with her feelings. She had been eyeing one humble knight ever since their first encounter during a past journey, and it seemed those feelings were starting to solidify. Despite her original intentions—manipulating him for her own gain—things had changed. Somewhere along the way, she might’ve actually fallen for him.

So naturally, she started her day by infiltrating a therapy session and eavesdropping on her crush.

Gotta show you care, right?

Outside of all that, Shiori had a proper mission today like everyone else: to investigate the [Star Site: Chronos dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=lhZpQ8N-1lD_eYDy&t=2014). Teaming up with Bae, Fuwawa, and Mococo, the group overcame the conquest and recovered long-lost memories of [Ouro Kronii](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=IaJKKnb-D4y6qJfY&t=5814).

And right as she stepped out of the dungeon, Gonathon—who was on a different team—emerged around the same time. Shiori, seizing the moment, dragged him off for a little one-on-one time.

He was kind, honest, and pure—everything she admired. And she knew that if she didn’t make a move soon, her chance might slip away. So, upon learning that Shakira had arranged a [blind date](https://www.youtube.com/live/l9VpZ0kmpeY?si=I8E4D1s69cbSEPwP&t=6398) for Gonathon, she approached the phoenix and, in her classic tsundere manner, asked to take the mystery slot.

But that seat was already filled. Due to a major misunderstanding, Shakira had placed Mordon in the date slot, believing she had feelings for Gonathon.

Still, Shiori wasn’t one to give up so easily. She had a plan: crash the date and steal Gonathon’s heart.

But things didn’t go how she’d hoped. Even after laying her heart bare, it all unraveled quickly (see [Shiori-Gonathon: The Witch’s Trials](#edge:gigi-shiori)).

Then, as if fate herself had taken pity on the heartbroken maiden, an old acquaintance—someone once dear—approached to help ease the pain. The two shared a long, heartfelt conversation, reflecting on the bond they once shared (see [Shiori-Bijou: Severed, but still there](#edge:shiori-bijou)).

Shiori closed out her day by journaling everything: her hopes, her heartbreak, and her thoughts on what might lie ahead.
