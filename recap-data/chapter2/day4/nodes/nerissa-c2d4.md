<!-- title: Nerissa (Juliet Bloodflame) Ravencroft -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Horses were little more than a means to an end in the strange, fantastical realm of Libestal—tools of travel, never the same twice, never familiar enough to name. Why pretend otherwise? Why act like each steed was a loyal companion when, clearly, they were replaced as often as socks?

And yet, Nerissa’s day began quite horsey indeed, eavesdropping on a conversation that was all about them. Fitting, considering the number of errands she had to gallop through before the big event of the day. These included arranging service negotiations with [Immerkind](https://youtu.be/zVWvu3ozXKM?t=2258s), ignoring spam mail like a responsible adult, restocking her humble shop (with a side of battle rations), and, most importantly—finding the perfect spot to hang her portrait. Not in her own home, no, but somewhere far more meaningful. Someone else's place. Someone special (see [Elizabeth–Nerissa](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

With all that done, it was time to prepare for the dungeon ahead. That meant food. That meant materials. That meant working the mines _and_ the farms just to supply her own ingredients. Was this really the life of a world-class chef? Apparently so.

But before she could get too deep into that grind, something... strange happened.

A crowd. Noise. Awooing. Why were people coming to her house? What were they doing? Why were they awooing?! And just like that, Nerissa had inadvertently joined a wolf pack. Yeah.

Anyway! Back to business.

For the day’s main event, Nerissa teamed up with Gonathon, Tam, and Mordan to tackle the Star Site: Chronos. It was no easy feat—slow progress, tough fights—but they pulled through and successfully recovered the lost memories of Tam, revealing her true identity as the Warden of Time: Ouro Kronii. A name that apparently instilled fear in some, given the rumors of [dictatorship](https://youtu.be/zVWvu3ozXKM?t=12798s)... which, of course, _couldn’t_ be true. Probably.

She also made a habit of barging into people’s homes—purely for fun, of course. Well... mostly just Elizabeth’s place, really. There, she stumbled upon some rather _interesting_ discoveries.

Specifically? “Fanfics.”

Yep. Hidden among the shelves and papers was Elizabeth’s personal collection of stories, if you could call them that. Were they romantic? Maybe. Dramatic? Guess so. Did Nerissa read them? Absolutely.

The rest of the day was spent exploring the newly revealed lands and diving deep into the [lore](https://www.youtube.com/live/zVWvu3ozXKM?si=1z93z1yY4ce4TH9M&t=16144) of the kingdom. Curious as ever, Nerissa couldn’t help but theorize and investigate, much like she had in her first journey. Always chasing answers, always wondering.

After all, even in a world of fleeting horses and forgotten pasts, some instincts—like curiosity—never fade.
