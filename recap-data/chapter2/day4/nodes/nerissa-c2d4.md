Horses were a mere instrument of efficient travel back in the fictitious Libestal, and no two steeds of yours would ever be the same creature, somehow. What logic was there to give them a single name — to pretend that they were the same companion, to form an attachment to it? [Womp womp](https://youtu.be/zVWvu3ozXKM?t=1257s).

There were many errands to square away before today's big event — negotiating services with Immerkind ([you're welcome for the hat](https://youtu.be/zVWvu3ozXKM?t=2258s)), ignoring spam mail, stocking up on her shop's offerings (plus some battle rations on the side), and finding the perfect place to display her portrait (see: [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Frame By Frame](#edge:liz-nerissa-right-2-left-2)).

Some of these recipes were simply ridiculous to reproduce in meaningful amounts. Having to work both the farms *and* the mines to supply your own ingredients seems a peculiar job description for a distinguished Chef- wait, [what are they talking about](https://youtu.be/zVWvu3ozXKM?t=4962s)? (see: [Calli-Nerissa: New Awoo No.2](#edge:nerissa-calli-right-2-left-2))

Experiencing the a day's worth of time in ten seconds, over, and over, and over again, did not bode well for our champions' psyche. Such was the price to pay to liberate the memories of Libestal's Queen (see: [Kronii](#node:kronii)).

Nerissa had seemingly been disillusioned with her OTP overnight, and she was right to have dropped it. With the revelation of the Outlander's eventual fate as the Outsider (shocker), she also recovered a pretty [traumatic fragment of her memory](https://youtu.be/Ydpggr1sBGs).

As if triggering a natural ability of preserving her sanity, Nerissa swiftly escaped from the brewing conflict and unrest over Tam Gandr's regal identity and personality. Make no mistake, though, for she would not withdraw support from a fellow Wolf based on [clear misunderstandings](https://youtu.be/zVWvu3ozXKM?t=12798s). Long live the Queen, AWOOOOO!!

Today was a productive day — She made good work of collating most of the Library's lost records of Libestan anecdotes and Prophecies, and she dabbled into the practical knowledge on exotic Stain dishes. Alas, her wish to get ahold of a decorative rose bush continued to escape her.
