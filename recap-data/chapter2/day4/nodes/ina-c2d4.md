Perhaps Bijou was not truly immune to the effects of the Stain (see [Ina-Bijou: Wooden Potato](#edge:bijou-ina)). All that hat was good for at this point was [building pity](https://youtu.be/l9HKSDG50HM?t=4659s)—you could also just pretend it was a handheld plush toy instead.

The time was finally due for NinoIna, donning her big jeweler hat, to finish building her humble abode. And humble it was, but it's really not that funny; it just needed some greenery—[warau na! :(](https://youtu.be/l9HKSDG50HM?t=4659s)

The Hero only managed to get around to defeating Stain King Pro*tato* today and was [blissfully ignorant](https://youtu.be/l9HKSDG50HM?t=7182s) of the gossip around the Princess and the Outlander's relationship and/or alleged familial status. Good for her.

[Man, was she cool](https://youtu.be/qV7dgz75tVo). NinoIna was overjoyed to see Queen Tammy's spirit return in full form. Her loyalty to this Time God entity was palpable, surely a sentiment shared by those of a "Cerulean" alignment (see [Gonathon](#node:gigi)), but this whole reveal came with some complications in the details; is Tam Gandr the Hero's stepmom? (See [Bijou-Kronii: Not Again...](#edge:bijou-kronii))

All things considered, NinoIna was really privileged in how she was living her life. Free of controversy, always on the grind, set on the straight and narrow to elevate herself to her strongest. She literally has [the strongest pickaxe in Libestal](https://youtu.be/l9HKSDG50HM?t=15902s).
