The fuzzy one kicked off her day at Gacharm—dutiful, as always. A model employee, yes, but more importantly, she had her eyes on the prize. Cold, hard cash. And with dreams of swimming in gold already sparkling in her mind, it made perfect sense why she was so eager to clock in.

But before cashing out, she had some catching up to do. The investigation of the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=mlKGQ7NhgMZ73vBu&t=1871) was still a blank in her itinerary, so she called in reinforcements. With the help of Immerkind, Bijou, Gonathon, and Ina, she powered through and got herself up to speed with the rest of the kingdom.

While waddling about afterwards, she happened upon a _very_ public therapy session between Mordan and Gonathon. And by “happened upon,” we mean she straight-up eavesdropped, with no shame in sight. Though one might question whether it even _was_ therapy, considering the kind of advice being handed out.

That’s when the lightbulb hit.

Why not become a therapist [herself](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=FdwTk8KAoS3pt2ch&t=3721)? Offer budget sessions with bargain-bin pricing and declare herself the most qualified while she’s at it—despite having no actual license or experience. None of that mattered.

After planting her flag in the mental health business, she joined up with Shiori, Bae, and Fuwawa to tackle the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=zHdcA0uQyy3zuFUw&t=4759). They fought through the trials and uncovered memories of [Ouro Kronii](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=GU5gPfrsUDdQPFUk&t=8555).

Then, the miracle happened.

While out gathering materials in the newly unlocked zones, she got her first call as a _licensed-in-spirit_ therapist. Her client? Shakira.

Shakira poured her heart out, detailing the mess she’d created by accidentally setting up a blind date between Mordan and Gonathon—based on a complete misunderstanding—and triggering a love triangle that caught Shiori in the emotional crossfire. It was a web of drama spiraling out of control, and she was at a loss on what to do.

Enter Mococo: therapist extraordinaire. She listened carefully, took in the drama, and then dropped her sage wisdom: _“Follow your heart.”_ Short. Vague. Possibly meaningful.

Then she asked for her payment. Then she hung up.

And that, folks, was therapy.

She closed her day with pride, documenting everything she’d accomplished—highlighting, of course, the mountain of money she raked in from [shop sales](https://www.youtube.com/live/T2StVW1kSxw?si=ngAzUQ4nmccPecin&t=10939), her paycheck, and her very first therapy gig. Not bad for a day’s work.
