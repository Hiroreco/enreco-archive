Our Knight's day started earlier than usual as she helped fellow knight Elizabeth conquer the previous day's dungeon. She worried that 2 knights would not be enough but, despite the difficulty, they prevailed.

She would return to an interesting scene as howls could be heard just outside of [Mordan Ramsay's Tavern](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=653). It seemed the Pack is bonding quite well despite the moon not out.

A newly built house in the distance that sent Kiara quite a [tickle](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=782). It reminded her fondly of one she had previously built and though Ina was a bit crossed, both would laugh and parted ways merrily. Kiara appreciated her own forge, marvelling the paintings Elizabeth put up and the improvements made. She was astounded by the [Shrine of Love](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=1038) and wondered if the Elizabeth and Nerissa had progressed their relationship in Kiara's short absence. The basement was another wonderful addition to the forge along with amusing journals framed on the wall.

Kiara saw her very dear cousin Immerkind (questionably related?) and complimented Cecilia's new hat but also expressed the she missed seeing Cecilia's head. The conversation would turn to Cecilia's plight yesterday and her woes and Kiara gently scolded her for the [alcoholism](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=1665). Kiara would offer her protection for the dungeon and Cecilia will inform her if there is a spot on her party later.

Kiara's love was put to the test when she stumbled on Gonathan's therapy session with Mordan. Her fellow orange knight told her that, unfortunately, Cecilia was against cousin romances. Despite this, Kiara would persevere! She will find a way to win Cecilia over. With that in the back of hermind, Kiara whisphered in turn about the blind date she set up for Gonathan.

But it seemed there is more to worry about Cecilia. First was Cecilia's loan from Bae that had a 100% interest rate. Second, the special "interest" Bae might have towards her cousin (now apparently blood-related) and... Cecilia's own flattery to the Peasant's advances? Is this another barrier for Kiara to win Cecilia's heart? Only *time* can tell.

But speaking of Time! It is Time for Kiara to enter The Chronos Dungeon. Here, their grasp of timing was put to the test. Conquering through their confusion, they soon defeated Stain King Chronos and found another treasured disc in the meanwhile. Soon another memory unfolds before them: Tammy's.

A Queen she was and regal she still is. Kiara couldn't help but admire her with the rest. But there are more important matters:  The Blind Date. The responsibility felt heavy on Kiara's shoulders, she promised Gonathan and she would see the date to its hopefully successful conclusion.

Ah. The Knight was so consumed by the date that she forgot to report matters to the Princess! But before Kiara could finish her report, Shiori interrupted with a small concern. She spoke of the blind date between Gonathan and Calli... but Shiori was interested in Gonathan. It seems matters are [complicated](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8573).

[Turmoil stirred in Kiara's noble heart.](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8832)

Confounded. Concerned. Fear of ruining an already blossoming love. She called Mococo for therapy but the advice 'follow your heart' could not simply solve the dilemma Kiara inadvertently created. How could she follow her heart when its path is unclear? She would ask Mordan if she was still interested in Gonathan and... [Mordan is ready for the date](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=9226). This is the best day of my life, Mordan exclaimed, to Kiara's growing horror.

As the date began, Kiara asked Shiori to watch the blind date with her, in case the love between the other Knight and Chef was not meant to be. Was it a bright idea to invite Shiori, who was clearly interested Gonathan, to the event? The short answer is 'no'. The longer answer: Shiori would dramatically pretend to drown, interrupting the date which would led *Mordan* to dive in to save her. [It got complicated](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=9745). The Good Knight is too popular for his own good.

Kiara fretted as everything around her burnt. Mordan proposed to Gonathan. Shiori rescued Gonathan from the dreaded **berry bush**. The silence from Gonathan was astounding as he cried to Tammy about [his woes](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10281). In the meanwhile, Shiori and Mordan would have a [simple non-blind date](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10111) but there is no 'spark' to be found between them.

But then, it seemed well. Gonathan seemed to have made a [choice](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10733). For a moment, all is right. A ring is given to Shiori. Then, without a shred of awareness and the naivete the size of Kronii's ego, [Gonathan took the trophy and threw it on the ground](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10733). Kiara would not be privy to more as the couple decided to resolve it privately.

So caught Kiara was with the drama that she forgot to do her jobs as a hero and as a smithy, quickly selling her wares and finishing her reports to Fia. *The Outlander and The Outsider* were the same! An ill-fated hero, punished by the gods. The news broke Iphania's own heart as well. Today is a terrible day for love.

But still, Kiara went through her day. Exploring the new area and soon acquring a diamond pickaxe which was soon upgraded by Cecilia. She herself would be selling the new legendary upgrade stones at a [very affordable price](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=13082).

Kiara traded her legendary upgrade stones for Bijou's legendary charms, Kiara couldn't help but pour her out to a friendly ear [and, accidentally, within hearing range of the couple in question](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14507). But it seemed they did not truly hear what Kiara said as they're having a dispute of their own.

Again, mesmerised by the flames of shattering love, Kiara watched it all [unfold](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14970) and heart-wrenched that her own hand, by which she swore to defend others with, had no small part in creating this drama that ultimately ended in Gonathan's broken heart. Even after burning herself at the campfire and turning into a ghostly phoenix for a moment, Kiara agonised the course of day. Her own failed endeavors towards kind cousin, the fumbled date between Gonathan and Mordan. Perhaps, Kiara's love was to be an appreciation for life.

All this she wrote on her journal. But, even if her goals were not met, it doesn't mean that others should suffer an equally miserable day. She paid her dues to Mococo, expressed to Shiori how Kiara had misunderstood her at first and now sees the kindness in her, and [buying a significant amount of food from Fuwawa's shop](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=18238). Unperfect Kiara may be, let it be known that her kindess is unfaltering.
