IRyS didn’t hold the spotlight today—no active POV—but that didn’t stop her from moving forward alongside the others. Determined not to fall behind, she joined Tam, Nerissa, and the Peasant in tackling the day’s major objective: the investigation of the Star Site: Chronos dungeon (see [Ina](#node:nino-ina-the-hot-purple-one)).

Together, they braved the challenges, unraveled its time-twisted puzzles, and emerged victorious. And in doing so, she recovered something unexpected—memories of someone very near and dear to her (see [Kronii-IRyS: Tyrannical Ruler](#edge:hot-pink-one-tam-gandr-right-2-left-2)).
