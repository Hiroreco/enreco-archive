The start of Bijou’s day felt… strange. Only through her vision did some things about the world before her look [strange.](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=237) All the charms turned into golden nuggets, and all the characters looked like disembodied stacks of horse armor—even Fia! This would last for several minutes.

This was the least of her troubles today. Far from it. In fact, the little princess was intertwined with a lot of the day’s drama. She even reconnected with a few people along the way.

NinoIna returned after being absent the day before. Blissfully unaware of what happened yesterday, she tried roping her sister to become one with the potato. Bijou agreed but, in turn, tried to get her to become one with the bread… to no avail. Bijou would stay in-bread though! (See [Ina-Bijou: Wooden Potato](#edge:bijou-ina))

Returning from the slaying session, Bijou comes across the Peasant and checks up on her mental state with that Stain hat on… [It doesn’t look too good for her.](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=4287)

Were the Peasant’s memories failing her? Is the Corruption at risk of spreading here too? She felt the need to speak with someone about this. Having discussed this matter with Gonathan earlier, she immediately called him up. She discovered that he was in the middle of a therapy session with Mordan Ramsey; she didn’t care, so she butted in like a kid getting an adult’s attention.

Mordan offered to give her two cents, but only after Bijou paid 100 coins (which she agreed upon as long as she got a snack from her—again, very childlike). The reaper suggests they try tricking the Peasant into giving up that cursed hat somehow in a trade. If that doesn’t work, Mordan would gladly take her into The Basement to forcibly take it off.

Speaking of The Basement, Bijou wanted to finally see it for herself as part of her therapy. She would NEARLY get inducted into The Wolf Pack… if only she wasn’t an in-bread. Regardless, Gonathan agreed to fight the corruption alongside her, should the need arise.

She would later join IRyS, Immerkind, Kiara, and Ina to investigate the day’s dungeon, Star Site: Chronos. It was there where they would recover the memories of Tam Gandr, or Ouro Kronii. With her memories restored, everyone returned from the dungeon worshipping her. In the midst of it all, Princess Bijou blurted, “Does that make you my mom?” (See [Bijou-Kronii: Not Again...](#edge:bijou-kronii))

Back at Gacharms, Kiara would visit to fulfill their trade relationship, patiently waiting in line for Bae to finish her pulls. She would end up [spilling tea](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=18313) to Bijou about a blind date he put Gonathan and Mordan on. It fell apart after she realized at the last moment that Gonathon had fallen for Shiori instead, who _appeared during said date…_ causing a chain reaction.

They suddenly started hearing voices above them… It was Gonathan and Shiori on the roof. Unbeknownst to Kiara and Bijou, there was _already_ an update to Kiara’s gossip that had transpired during her entire talk. The interaction that ensued on the roof set off a chain reaction caused by a misunderstanding, and eventually… a divorce (see [Gigi-Shiori: The Witch’s Trials](#edge:gigi-shiori)).

Several people watched the breakup happen before their eyes, behind the glass windows of Shiori’s house. Bijou couldn’t help feeling sad seeing Shiori cry, so she came to her side soon after. She took this opportunity to reconcile with her past and get back with Shiori. She wanted to mend Shiori’s twice-broken heart. She also felt bad about abandoning their child, Khaos, and vowed to bring him back (see [Bijou-Shiori: Severed, but still there](#edge:shiori-bijou)).

Now Bijou has double the motivation for what she vented about to Mordan and Gonathan. There was a moral need to get the Peasant to give up that Stain hat. This would ultimately be for everyone’s sake… but especially her own, to fix her relationship with Shiori. It was not just a (cursed) hat; it was her child. Their child. How she’ll do it… is a problem for another time.

She spent the rest of the day gathering materials, all the while pondering if she should confess to Gonathan her feelings towards Shiori. He had forgotten all about their previous adventure in the illusory version of Libestal. She figured that she didn’t want Gonathan to feel bad about taking her girl, so she had to say _something_ about it.

They both agreed to meet back at Gacharm, and it’s there that Bijou confessed about her rekindled love for Shiori. The entire truth came out, and Gonathan seemed to be understanding, despite looking troubled and pacing around in place.
