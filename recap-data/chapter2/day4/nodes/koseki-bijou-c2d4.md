The start of Bijou’s day felt… strange. Only through her vision, some things about the world before her looked [strange.](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=237) All the charms turned into golden nuggets, and all the characters looked like disembodied stacks of horse armor—even [Fia](#node:fia)! This would last for several minutes.

This was the least of her troubles today. Far from it. In fact, the little princess was intertwined with a lot of the day’s drama. She even reconnected with a few people along the way. Especially with one she thought she wouldn’t get a chance to reconcile with.

NinoIna returned after being absent from the day before. Blissfully unaware of what happened yesterday, she tried roping her sister to become one with the potato. Bijou agreed, but in turn tried to get her to become one with the bread. …To no avail. Bijou could stay in-bread though! (See [Ina-Bijou: Wooden Potato](#edge:koseki-bijou-nino-ina-the-hot-purple-one-right-2-left-2)) 
Seems like not many people bought into the bread cult thing, and her sister was no exception.

Before going to Star Site: Chronos, Immerkind and Bijou went exploring to kill Stains in the second area. It’s at this point where she started calling Bijou “Chibi-hime”.

Returning from the slaying session, Bijou comes across the Peasant and checks up on her mental state with that Stain hat on… [It doesn’t look too good for her.](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=4287)

The Peasant’s memories were failing her? Is the Corruption at risk of spreading here too? She felt the need to speak with someone about this. Having discussed this matter with Gonathan earlier, she immediately called him up. She discovered that she was in the middle of a therapy session with Mordan Ramsey; she didn’t care and butted in like a kid getting an adult’s attention.

Mordan offered to give her two cents, but only after Bijou paid 100 coins (which she agreed upon as long as she got a snack from her—again, very child-like). The reaper suggests they try tricking the Peasant into giving up that cursed hat somehow in a trade. If that doesn’t work, Calli would gladly take her into The Basement to forcibly take it off.

Speaking of The Basement, Bijou wanted to finally see it for herself, as part of her therapy. She would NEARLY get inducted into The Wolf Pack… if only she wasn’t an in-bread. Regardless, Gonathan agreed to fight the corruption alongside her, should the need arise.

As if nothing happened preceding, Gonathan joined forces with Bijou to revisit the Stronghold of Ruin, helping Ina, Fuwawa, and Mococo out going through it for the first time. 

She would later join IRyS, Immerkind, Kiara, and Ina to investigate the day’s dungeon, Star Site: Chronos. It was there where they would recover the memories of Tam Gandr, or Ouro Kronii. With her memories restored, everyone returned from the dungeon worshipping her. In the midst of it all, Princess Bijou blurted, “Does that make you my mom?” (see [Bijou-Kronii: Not Again...](#edge:koseki-bijou-tam-gandr-top-2-top-2))

Following the dungeon, Bijou immediately sets out to find new materials for the best charms—Legendary Charms using Enigmatic Stones that kind of look like the gem on her chest. Perhaps it was fate that she became a Jeweler after all. 

Back at Gacharms, Kiara would visit to fulfil their trade relationship, patiently waiting in line for Bae to finish her pulls. She would end up [spilling tea](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=18313) to Bijou about a blind date he put Gonathan and Mordan on. It fell apart after she realized at the last moment that Gonathon had fallen for Shiori instead, who *appeared during said date…* causing a chain reaction.

They suddenly started hearing voices above them… It was Gonathan and Shiori on the roof. Unbeknownst to Kiara and Bijou, there was *already* an update to Kiara’s gossip that had transpired during her entire talk. Bijou was fine letting Gonathan and Shiori continue to use the roof of the shop. The interaction that ensued on the roof set off its own chain reaction caused by a misunderstanding, and eventually… a divorce (see [Gigi-Shiori: The Witch’s Trials](#edge:gonathon-g-shiori-nyavella-top-2-bottom-1)).

Several people watched the breakup happen before their eyes, behind the glass windows of Shiori’s house. Bijou couldn’t help feeling sad seeing Shiori cry, so she came to her side soon after. She took this opportunity to reconcile with her past and get back with her. She wanted to mend Shiori’s twice-broken heart. She also felt bad about abandoning their child Khaos and vowed to bring him back (see [Bijou-Shiori: Severed, but still there](#edge:shiori-nyavella-koseki-bijou-top-1-bottom-4)).

Now Bijou has double the motivation for what she vented about to Mordan and Gonathan. There was a moral need to get the Peasant to give up that Stain hat. This would ultimately be for everyone’s sake… but especially her own, to fix her relationship with Shiori. It's not just a (cursed) hat; it was her child. Their child. How she’ll do it… is a problem for another time.

She spent the rest of the day gathering materials, all the while pondering if she should confess to Gonathan about her feelings about Shiori. He had forgotten all about their previous adventure in the illusory version of Libestal. She figured that she didn’t want Gonathan to feel bad about taking her girl, so she had to say *something* about it.

They both agreed to meet back at Gacharm, and it’s there where Bijou confessed about her rekindled love for Shiori. The entire truth came out, and Gonathan seemed to be understanding, despite looking troubled and pacing around in place.

Bijou was the last one around for the day, working overtime to make sure the shop was ready for the next day. Nobody would be around to hear her practice [howling… “like a pup”](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=22518). She may have more than that dawg in her after all.

She also left exactly [8008 coins](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=23011) in her pocket. Just for laughs. We all needed it after what had transpired this day; herself and the voices in her head. [Maybe Fuwawa could smile a bit too.](https://youtu.be/Zg3rYsc61XI?t=22932)
