Cecilia awakens refreshed and clear of mind after a restful night outdoors. She continues her morning ritual of visiting the princess, writing a letter, taking a whiff of her [enamoring scent](https://www.youtube.com/live/NGC0VaSUPnE?t=990s), and enjoying her presence.

Immerkind continues her quest to win the hearts and minds of the population as she toils for 5,000 gold to purchase a ring for the princess. This includes kind activities such as [gambling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=2974s), pickaxe sales, and taking out a 100% interest loan. She also bought a nice hat.

The party of Cecilia, NinoIna, Hot Pink One, Princess Bijou, and Karia depart for the Star Site: Chronos, where they [successfully discover the secret artifact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=12540s) and defeat the Stain King Chronos to uncover the memories of Tam Gandr.

The group surrounds Kronii and barrages her with questions, but they notice her demeanor has changed. Cecilia questions Kronii about whether the [European kisses and drinks they shared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=14720s) still matter, which she claims they do not. As the group mourns this new version of Tam, it is easy to wonder if memories are worth retrieving if it means replacing the one they learned to love.

Cecilia seeks an audience with the princess in order to finally be told the truth; however, Cecilia overhears Commander Kopis remarks to Iphania about ["The Outlander of Yours"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=15300s) which sends her thoughts reeling. She quickly disengages and heads for Fia.

Once Immerkind learns the truth about the Outsider, Tam Gandr explains how time travel could still explain how Iphania and the Outsider are siblings. This means Cecilia still has a chance, and this moment brings Queen Tam and Cecilia closer.

Cecilia continues to toil for money to pay off her debts and purchase the ring for Iphania; however, she continues to be involved in the struggles of her fellow Starlights. She eventually earns enough money and gleefully pays off her debt and [purchases the ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=19525s).

As Cecilia prepared to retire for the night, she received an urgent call from Gonathon. She immediately puts aside her plans and provides urgent relationship counsel to Gonathon, but the [complexity of the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=20300s) requires her in-person presence. She tells Gonathon once more to:

Upon writing one more letter to Iphania and Gonathon, she retires for the night. Unbeknownst to her, this kind of action made the kingdom much brighter.
