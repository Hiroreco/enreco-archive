Cecilia awakens refreshed and clear of mind after a restful night outdoors. She continues her morning ritual of visiting the princess, writing a letter, taking a whiff of her [enamoring scent](https://www.youtube.com/live/NGC0VaSUPnE?t=990s), and enjoying their presence.

Immerkind continues to win the hearts and minds of the population as she toils for 5,000 gold to purchase a ring for the princess. This includes kindly activities such as [gambling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=2974s), pick axe sales, and getting a 100% interest loan. She also bought a nice hat.

The party of Cecilia, NinoIna, HPO, Princess Bijou, and Karia depart for the Star Site: Chronos where they [successfully discover the secret artifact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=12540s) and slay the Stain King Chronos and undercover the memories of Tam Gandr.

The group surrounds Kronii and barrage her with questions but they notice her demeanor has changed. Cecilia questions Kronii about if the [european kisses and drinks they shared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=14720s) still matter which she claims it does not. As the group mourns this new Tammy, it is easy to wonder if memories are worth retrieving if it means replacing the one they learned to love.

Cecilia seeks an audience with the princess in order to finally be told the truth; however, Cecilia overhears Commander Kopis makes a remark to Iphania of ["The Outlander of Yours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=15300s) which sends her thoughts reeling. She quickly disengages and heads for Fia. 

Once Immerkind learns the truth of The Outsider, Tam Gandr explains how time travel can still make Iphania and The Outsider siblings. This means Cecilia still has a chance and this moment brings Queen Tam and Cecilia closer.

Cecilia continues to toil for money to pay off her debts and purchase the ring for Iphania; however, she becomes continually involved in the struggles her fellow Starlights. She eventually earns enough money and gleefully pays off her debt and [purchases the ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=19525s).

As Cecilia prepared to retire for the night, she receives an urgent call from Gonathon. She immediately puts aside her plans and provides urgent relationship counsel to Gonathon but the [complexity of the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=20300s) requires her in person presence. She tells Gonathon once more to:

[Listen to your heart and mind](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=21370s)

Upon writing one more letter to Iphania and Gonathon, she retires for the night. Unbeknownst to her, this kind action made the kingdom much more brighter.
