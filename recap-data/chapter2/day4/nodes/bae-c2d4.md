<!-- title: Peasant The Bae -->
<!-- status: In-bread -->

It was another brilliant morning for Peasant The Bae, a peasant with a whopping 13K gold. But, as she went around showing off her new hat, the others looked at it warily, [inquiring how Bae felt](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=428) to her bemusement.

[Peasant Partner Loan (PP)](#embed:https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=1188)

Bae knew what it felt like to be poor, penniless, and destitute. But now that she was overwhelmingly wealthy (for a peasant), she could now help others much poorer than herself. With this in mind, Peasant Partner Loans was created for those in need of petty cash. Of course, nothing in life is free, and an interest rate of 150%—subject to change—was only fair.

Those who don't pay back? Well, Bae can be persistent. Persistence was shown as Bae took a page from Roa's business book and sent out advertisements of her own, each ad tailored uniquely for a certain prospective customers. Except for one. Cecilia Immerkind would get a special courtesy call from Bae and a reduced interest rate of 100%... success! PP Loans would have its first debtor in the Kind Knight. And its first detractor was the [Hot Pink One, who accused Bae of running a scam](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=3711), which Bae denied. She was running a legitimate business!

Bae's health and morality were, once again, questioned by Bijou and others. They asked her a simple question: A wagon was traveling down a trail but was soon caught between a forked road. On one road lay a baby who would only live until 5, and the other road had 5 elderly people, each having 1 year left to live. The child or the elderly, who would Bae choose to condemn?

They fretted as Bae pondered her answer but calmed when she said, "I would stop the wagon." But when pushed to choose, Bae ultimately decided to condemn the _baby_, for [they have to kill a baby anyways](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=4026). As she answered, Bae entered a strange trance but seemed to return to normal.

Ignorant of her friends' troubled expressions, Bae turned her attention to the day's current challenge: The Chronos Dungeon. Time. Rewind. Pause. The machinations of the dungeon would confuse our heroes as they made their way through. At last, only Stain King Chronos stood in their way. Like the challenges of the dungeon itself, Time was in his grasp, but it was not enough. Soon another memory, Tammy's, would be unveiled.

[Tammy was a queen!](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=8275) And a Time Warden, but that was unimportant. Bae was astounded that she was in the presence of royalty all this time! But Bae worried—would her memories be up to par? In a rare moment of comradery, IRyS echoed this sentiment; she was drunk in memories! Unsightly compared to the Warden's regal aura.

Tammy comforted them and reaffirmed that the Hot Pink One is a goddess no matter what. While it seemed that Tammy was still her same kind self... until the Queen called them _plebeians_. Bae may be a peasant but that is an honorable title! She got it from her mother, who got it from her mother, who got it from her mother.

As Bae reported the dungeon's events, she learned only heavier news: the kingdom was still on track for ruination, and the Outsider was the heroic Outlander. But, despite the series of unfortunate events, a silver lining was found: diamonds. Bae found her skills as a supplier only grew, and the culmination of her hard work draws near...

[PICK OF POWER (PP)](#embed:https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=11740)

A diamond pickaxe maxed out to its true potential. A new Axe of Power (AP) would soon be created to match her PP. Bae's mother would be proud. And just like how she bears the Peasant title proudly, Bae will never forget her roots, framing the older iron pickaxe and axe on the walls of her shop. Business was booming as Bae forged Ina a new diamond pickaxe and sold Bijou a handsome stack of enigmatic stones.

Cecilia would successfully pay back her loan at the end of the day. But not all customers would be sold, as Queen Tam refused Bae's services, and a strange moment occurred when [Tammy yelled at the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=12995), who promptly ran away.

Just as Bae was about to go to bed—staying up late was something Mother would have disapproved of—she quickly realized that there were a few chores left to be done. She quickly called Bijou to gacha a few charms, luckily winning her gambles, and would go to buy a legendary upgrade stone from Gonathon to witness the [Good Knight's Marital Troubles](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=14642).

Astounded, shocked, and confused, Bae wasn't sure what to do, but the time was ticking, and she was already past her bedtime. She interrupted the drama to quickly finish the trade with Gonathon and sleep for the day, unaware of how the Knight's night would end.
