It was another brilliant morning for Peasant The Bae, a peasant with a whopping 13K gold. But, as she went around showing off her new hat, they looked at it warily, [inquiring how Bae felt](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=428) to her bemusement.

[Peasant Partner Loan (PP)](#embed:https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=1188)

Bae knew what it felt like to be poor, penniless and destitute. But now she was overwhelminingly rich (for a peasant) she can help others much poorer than she. With this in mind, Peasant Partner Loans was created for those in need of petty cash. Of course, nothing in life comes for free and the interest rates of 150% (at a variable rate) is only fair (to be paid back within 2 business days including day of first lent). Those who don't pay back? Well, Bae can be persistent. A persistance showed when, taking a note from Roa's business book, Bae sent advertisements of her own, each ad tailored uniquely for each possible customer. Except for one. Cecilia Immerkind would get a special courtesy call from Bae and a reduced interest rate of 100%... success! PP Loans would have its first debtor in the Kind Knight. And it's first detractor as the [Hot Pink One accused of Bae running a scam](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=3711), which Bae denied. She was running a legitimate business!

Soon, Bae's health and morality, would also be in question as Bijou, and others, asked her a simple question: A wagon was traveling down a trail but was soon caught between a forked road. On one road, laid a baby who would only live until 5, and the other road had 5 elderly people, each having 1 year left to live. The child or the elderly, who would Bae choose to condemn? They fretted as Bae pondered her answer but calmed when she said 'I would stop the wagon'. But when pushed to choose, Bae would ultimately decided to condemn the *baby* for [they have to kill a baby anyways](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=4026). As she answered, Bae entered a strange trance but seemed to return to normal.

Ignorant of her friends' troubled expressions, Bae turned her attention to the day's current challenge: The Chronos Dungeon. Time. Rewind. Pause. The machinations of the dungeon would confuse our heroes as they made their way through. At last, only Stain King Chronos stood in their way. Like the challenges of the dungeon itself, Time was in his grasp but it was not enough. Soon another memory, Tammy's, would unevail.

[Tammy was a Queen!](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=8275) And a Time Warden, but Bae was astounded that she was in the presence of royalty all this time! But Bae worried- would her own memories be up to par? In a rare moment of comradery, IRyS echoed this sentiment, she was drunk in memories! Unsightly compared to the Warden's regal aura. Tammy comforted them and reaffirmed that the Hot Pink One is a goddess no matter what. While it seemed that Tammy was still her same kind self, Bae gasped when Tammy, Queen Tammy, called them *plebians*. Bae may be a peasant but that is an honourable title! She got it from her mother who got it from her mother who got it from her mother. The Queen might soon turn a tyrant and turn the kingdom into a dictatorship.

Hearts heavy at their friend's change, Bae reported back to the Princess and learnt that the ruination still spreads and the kingdom is still in danger. Another upsetting news was that The Outsider was once the Outlander! Once The Watcher, he interfered in Libestal's fate and angered the gods (who is not IRyS). The Outsider was a true hero, only turning evil from the years of imprisonment for interfering with Fate. 

Despite the rough events, a silver lining was found: Diamonds. Bae found her skills as a supplier only grew and the culmination of her hard work draws near...

[PICK OF POWER (PP)](#embed:https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=11740)

A diamond pickaxe, maxed out to its true potential. Bae's mother would be proud. And just like how she bears the Peasant title proudly, Bae will never forget her roots; as she finished her new Axe of Power (AP), she framed PP and PA in her workshop. Soon, Ina would be her first customer for the upgrades, and Bijou would purchase Enigmatic stones, both siblings paying a reasonable price. Bae tried to offer her services to quetionably good Queen Tammy but did not need it at the moment. Bae then witness [Tammy yell at the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=12995) who promptly ran away.

Cecilia would successfully also pay back her loan at the end of the day. The two would converse about their business and Bae advised her that Cecilia's kind prices could afford to be raised since the labour to improve such tools is rather intensive. Kiara would also offer legendary upgrade stones at a cheap price, which Bae was shocked by. She bought 2, as she had promised Gonathan to buy his wares later.

Just as Bae was about to go to bed, staying up late was something Mother would have disapproved, she quickly realised that there were a few chores left to be done. She quickly called Bijou to gacha a few charms, luckily winning her gambles, and would go to buy a legendary upgrade stone Gonathan to witness the [Good Knight's Marital Troubles](https://youtu.be/tEdXQofZuf8?t=14642). Astounded, shocked, and confused, Bae wasn't sure what to do but the time was ticking, and she was already past her bedtime, she would interrupt the drama to quickly finish the trade with Gonathan and slept for the day, unaware of how the Knight's night would end.
