**The Humble Fumbler**

As the sun rose on day four, no one could foresee the maelstrom of turmoil and tragedy that would engulf Gonathon and those closest to him. The day began simply enough, with the Humble Knight visiting Gacharms to acquire new equipment. Chief on Gonathon’s mind was the suspected corruption of Peasant the Bae, which soon extended to Princess Bijou upon learning of her past corruption (see [Bijou-Gonathon: A Rock and a Hard Place](#edge:gigi-bijou)). These concerns had to be set aside, as an encounter with Immerkind led to Gonathon becoming once again conflicted with the [role](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=21m13s) he had played in Immerkind’s delusional pursuit of the Princess. (See [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Kind and the Humble Knight](#edge:cecilia-gigi))

His search for solace led him to Mordan Ramsey, who, after some haggling, agreed to become Gonathon’s therapist (see [Mordan-Gonathon: A Powerful Dynamic](#edge:calli-gigi)). It was during their discussions that Mordan revealed that not only was the [Pearl](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=1h23m45s) someone very close to Gonathon but was, in fact, his former lover who had since disappeared.

Gonathon had little time to ponder these revelations, as he joined Tam Gandr, Nerissa, and Mordan in tackling the next dungeon, [Star Site: Chronos](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=1h44m14s). The puzzles and boss proved to be a formidable challenge, but they paled in comparison to what came next. Upon the Stain King’s fall, a flood of memories returned to Gonathon: Tam Gandr was the Queen of the previous Libestal and a powerful Time Warden. Returning to Libestal, Tam and Gonathon shared a heartfelt reunion, with both affirming their ironclad bond and Gonathon pledging to stand by Tam no matter what (see [Gonathon-Kronii: The Queen’s Gambit](#edge:kronii-gigi)).

From here things took a turn for the dramatic, with Shiori of the Nyavellas at the center of it all (see [Gonathon-Shiori: Trials of the Witch](#edge:gigi-shiori)). While Gonathon and Shiori's newfound love was still just beginning to blossom, this love would be stretched all the way to the breaking point.

The destined blind date set up by Shakira finally occurred, with [Gonathon’s date being none other than Mordan Ramsey!](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h11m48s) Things only got worse as Shiori, seeking to observe the date, began to drown and had to be saved by Mordan. As the two rivals for Gonathon’s affection started to quarrel, the hapless knight couldn’t take the pressure and fled.

It was here that Gonathon’s lack of decisiveness and blind loyalty reared its ugly head, as the knight begged for Tam Gandr to not only provide advice but also to [directly observe and live](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=3h28m55s) with him and Shiori as a way of preventing any misdeeds on his part.

While Tam agreed to assist, all of this was too much for Shiori. She decided to test Gonathon to prove his devotion and eventually formed a soul pact with him, and they briefly became husband and wife. A meeting with Immerkind led to some more [words of wisdom](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h23m50s) from the green wolf: that even if Gonathon’s memories were not the same as they were in the past, deep down Gonathon was still the same person. The two wolves vowed to escape this timeline together, their bond stronger than ever.

Alas, none of this was enough to overcome Gonathon’s crippling dedication to his queen and inability to make his own decisions. Upon returning home, Gonathon encountered what seemed to be a startling scene: [Tam Gandr and Shiori engaging in an affair!](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h31m02s) But rather than seek answers from the two, the bumbling knight chose to once again flee, an act that, along with Shiori [falling to her death](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=4h36m00s) while trying to explain to Gonathon, completely broke the battered witch and led to her ending her romance with Gonathon.

Devastated and overcome with regret, Gonathon’s final moments of the day were spent being consoled by Tam Gandr. The queen urged Gonathon to think carefully about his feelings and who he truly loved. But despite all of these misfortunes and frustrations that Gonathon had inflicted on himself and others, Tam remained committed to Gonathon, and the two [parted on hopeful terms](https://youtu.be/BSPi8sTHdAY?t=5h6m45s). For hope was now something that Gonathon needed more than anything, and in his daily journal, he once again reflected on those that he loved and had loved. He ended by expressing a desire to make tomorrow a better day. Godspeed, Gonathon G.
