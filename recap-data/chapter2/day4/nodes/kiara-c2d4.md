Our Knight's day started earlier than usual, as she helped her fellow knight Elizabeth conquer the previous day's dungeon. She worried that two knights would not be enough but, despite the difficulty, they prevailed.

It was an interesting day as well, from the howls just outside [Mordan Ramsey's Tavern](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=653) to a newly built house whose design left Kiara [giggling](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=782). The Lorekeeper remembered previous constructs Ina had built once before, though Ina pouted at Kiara's reaction; t'was nothing more than a jest between friends. Kiara marveled at her own forge's design, appreciating the little touches Elizabeth had improved, particularly the [Shrine of Love](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=1038). Has Elizabeth's and Nerissa's relationship improved while Kiara was gone?

Kiara's own relationship with her questionably related cousin was lacking. Though she expressed fondness for Cecilia's new hat, worry emerged as they talked about Cecilia's plight, a worry that only grew when Kiara learned of her cousin's [alcohol problem](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=1665). and her taking out a loan from the Peasant The Bae. The thought of winning Cecilia's heart seemed only to grow more grueling. Gonathan revealed Cecilia's aversion to cousin romances, and that Bae had a _special_ interest in the Kind Knight. Nonetheless, it was a challenge, and Kiara would rise to meet it.

But there is another duty Kiara must rise to: the Chronos Dungeon, where their grasp of timing was put to the test. Conquering through their confusion, they soon defeated Stain King Chronos and found another treasured disc in the meanwhile. Soon another memory unfolds before them: Tammy's.

A Queen Tammy was, and regal she still is; Kiara couldn't help but admire her. But there are more important matters: The Blind Date. The promise to Gonathan felt heavy on Kiara's shoulders, but she would ensure it would reach a lovely conclusion.

Ah, the Knight was so consumed by the date that she forgot to report matters to the Princess! But before Kiara could finish her report, Shiori interrupted with a small concern. She spoke of the blind date between Gonathan and Mordan... but Shiori was interested in Gonathan. It seems matters are [complicated](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8573).

[Turmoil stirred in Kiara's noble heart.](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=8832)

Confounded. Concerned. Fear of ruining an already blossoming love. Kiara called Mococo for therapy, but the advice 'follow your heart' was too simple for a complicated matter that Kiara inadvertently created. How could she follow her heart when its path is unclear? Especially when Mordan was [ready for the date](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=9226). This is the best day of my life, Mordan exclaimed, to Kiara's growing horror.

As the date began, Kiara invited Shiori to watch the blind date with her, in case the love between the Humble Knight and Therapist was not meant to be. Was it a bright idea to invite Shiori, who was interested in Gonathan, to the event? The short answer is 'no.' The longer answer: Shiori would dramatically pretend to drown, interrupting the date, which would lead _Mordan_ to dive in to save her. [It got more complicated](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=9745). The Good Knight is too popular for his own good.

Kiara fretted as everything fell apart. Mordan proposed to Gonathan. Shiori rescued Gonathan from the dreaded **berry bush**. The silence from Gonathan was astounding as he cried to Tammy about [his woes](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10281) while Shiori and Mordan had a [simple non-blind date](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10111), though no spark could be had between them.

Ultimately, Gonathan seemed to have made his [choice](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10733). For a moment, all is right. A ring was given to Shiori. Then, without a shred of awareness and with the naivete the size of Kronii's ego, [Gonathan took the trophy and threw it on the ground](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=10733). Whatever happened next, Kiara did not witness.

Even Princess Iphania wasn't spared, as the revelation of _The Outsider_ and _The Outlander_ broke her heart. The hero she fancied would be punished by the gods. Truly, a terrible day for love.

But still, Kiara went through her day. Exploring the new area and soon acquiring a diamond pickaxe, which was soon upgraded by Cecilia. She would be selling the new legendary upgrade stones at a [very affordable price](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=13082) and trading a few for Bijou's legendary charms.

Kiara couldn't help but pour her heart out to the Gacharm's friendly earâ€”[accidentally, within hearing range of the couple in question](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14507). Though they didn't hear Kiara's woes, Kiara couldn't help but follow the couple. Mesmerized by the flames of shattering love, Kiara watched it all [unfold](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=14970).

Heart-wrenched and guilty that her own hand, by which Kiara swore to defend others, had no small part in creating the drama that ultimately ended in Gonathan's broken heart, Kiara burned herself at the campfire and turned into a ghostly phoenix. It was an agonizing day. Her own failed endeavors towards her kind cousin, the fumbled date between Gonathan and Mordan, and Shiori and Gonathan's break-up. Perhaps Kiara's love was to be an appreciation for life.

All this she wrote in her journal. But, even if her goals were not met, it doesn't mean that others should suffer an equally miserable day. She paid her dues to Mococo, expressed to Shiori how Kiara had misunderstood her at first and now sees the kindness in her, and [bought a significant amount of food from Fuwawa's shop](https://youtu.be/wCysZh57Hcc?t=18238). Unperfect Kiara may be, but let it be known that her kindness is unfaltering.
