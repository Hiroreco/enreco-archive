<!-- title: Tam Gandr -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Today felt important for Tam—she couldn’t explain why, but there was something in the air. A pull. A subconscious urgency. With that, she joined Mordan, Gonathon, and Nerissa, setting off to tackle the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=eMc-IJaSIceRJmM9&t=685).

Time. That was the theme of the dungeon, made clear from the moment they stepped inside. Day and night flickered like a faulty lantern, the sky shifting with every step. The trials? All timed. Every challenge ticked down ominously, each misstep shaving away precious seconds. Even the puzzles, though unforgiving, could be reset—_rewound_ as if the dungeon itself had bent to the flow of time. And then there were the platforms—eerie heads embedded in them, silent observers of every movement. The visuals were unsettling, sure, but more than that, they felt... fitting.

Tam couldn’t place it at first. Not until they felled the dungeon's boss.

That’s when it hit her.

She was Ouro Kronii—the Warden of Time itself. The keeper of the timeline, the one who mended fractures and corrected anomalies across dimensions. She wasn’t just a broke queen with an ego—she was _important_. A literal guardian of the universal clock.

Unfortunately, the truth didn’t exactly come with celebratory fanfare.

In fact, it brought more headaches than clarity:

- The love of her life, the devoted peasant who once adored her, and that unhinged green gremlin, who never missed a chance to stir chaos—_all_ of them were under the impression that she was a tyrant. A cold, dictatorial overlord (see [Kronii-IRyS: Tyrannical Ruler](#edge:irys-kronii)).

- Speaking of the green one—Immerkind, obsessed with the Princess as always—nearly jumped off the deep end, and Kronii had to drag her back from the edge (see [Kronii-Immerkind: Drinks between Queen and Knight](#edge:cecilia-kronii)).

- Getting dragged into adopting someone else's once daughter (see [Kronii-Bijou: Not Again...](#edge:bijou-kronii))

- And to top it all off, Gonathon G, her ever-loyal servant, was in the middle of a love fiasco that she somehow got [blamed for](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=52HWNzLYw1YlgPp8&t=10344). Something about heartbreak and false hope, and _she_ ended up the scapegoat (see [Kronii-Gonathon: The Queen’s Gambit](#edge:kronii-gigi)).

So yes. Quite the day for Miss Warden. Miss Queen. Miss “I Actually Control Time Itself.”

But she survived it all. Held her head high. And—of course—ended the day by journaling every bit of it, sprinkling in generous self-praise like the full-blown narcissist she was.
