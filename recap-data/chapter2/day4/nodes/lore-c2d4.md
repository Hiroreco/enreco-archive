#### Main Story

Another piece of memory was recovered as the heroes conquered Star Site: Chronos—one being the recollection of Ouro Kronii, the other the crucial information needed to achieve the goal of preventing the Outsider from coming into existence.

It turned out he was the Outsider himself. The Outlander’s true identity was the Watcher, a member of the Collective. By rejecting his role and intervening in Libestal’s fate, he upset the Higher Being and was imprisoned for all eternity, ultimately becoming the Outsider.

From this, Fia devised a plan: to change this grim fate, the heroes—not the nameless swordsman—must rise and take up the burden of saving the world in his place. That way, he won't be punished, ultimately preventing the Outsider from coming into existence.

#### Uncovered Information

Upon conquering Star Site: Chronos, the heroes unlocked the Remnants of the Antigonian Aerie, one of the lands that once served as a place for refugees—those who had lost their homes to the Stains. Ultimately, it too was consumed by the spreading evil. It was here that the journals of a refugee and caretaker of gryphons were found, chronicling the devastation wrought by the Stains—losses that included not only their home, but also their beloved companions.
