#### Main Story
Another piece of memory recovered as the heroes conquered Star Site: Chronos, one being the recollection Ouro Kronii, the other being the crucial info needed to achieve the goal of stopping the Outsider from coming into existence.

It turned out he was the Outsider himself. The Outlander’s true identity was the watcher, a member of Collective, by rejecting his role and intervening with Libestal’s fate, he upset the Higher Being and got imprisoned for all eternity, ultimately turning him into the Outsider.

Devising from this, Fia came up with a plan: to change this grim fate, the heroes—not the nameless swordsman—need to rise and take up the burden of saving the world in his place. That way, he won't be punished, ultimately stopping the Outisder from coming into existence.
