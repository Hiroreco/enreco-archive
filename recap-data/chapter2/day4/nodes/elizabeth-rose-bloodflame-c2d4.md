**Part 1**

A forge built, new stories unfolding—Elizabeth looked back on the day before with a sense of clarity. With each step forward, her journey was beginning to take shape. It may have started on rocky footing, sure, but with new knowledge earned and kind souls met—chief among them the mighty phoenix who had helped her so much—Elizabeth now felt steadier, more grounded, and more determined than ever to keep moving forward. And of course, in the midst of all the day’s events, her moments with Nerissa stood out—moments she hoped to see more of today (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Frame By Frame](#edge:elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-nerissa-ravencroft-right-2-left-2)).

Her morning began much like the previous one, with her ever-dependable sugar phoenix once again offering assistance for a major task: investigating the Stronghold of Ruin. Before setting off, Elizabeth took a brief tour around the kingdom, admiring the creations people had built—and couldn’t help but feel a strange déjà vu seeing enormous [floating text](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=gbwqdZGPxPB_RjoQ&t=651) in the sky again.

The dungeon itself was conquered with success, and with the mission complete, she moved on to gathering materials. During a brief lull, Elizabeth checked in with [Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=ZHTbaG0Zv_dYDNx4&t=5606), who had tried to contact her earlier. What followed was a friendly—if somewhat bizarre—back-and-forth full of playful jabs, as the two debated their way of addressing each other: one being a knight and the other being a witch.

Shiori also took the opportunity to promote her growing business, selling "memories"—detailed records of each day’s journey. Elizabeth, intrigued, bought a few and read through them, raising a suspicious brow with each entry.

As the day continued, Elizabeth focused on improving her forge, even constructing a hidden underground bunker to safely store her goods. Of course, she had a secondary motive too: a perfect place to [prank people](https://www.youtube.com/live/vbppXmxXo7o?si=ewOxwttSz3l0BUTO&t=22074) without being caught.

She wrapped up the first half of her day on a warm, wholesome note—spending quiet, meaningful time with Nerissa, as their bond continued to deepen.

**Part 2**

Tired and slightly sleepy, Elizabeth still did her best to keep up with her journal. Thoughts wandered to her Jade Forge, to her old animal companions from journeys past—silly memories, sure, but they made her heart ache in a warm, nostalgic way. 

But just as she wrapped up her writing, a sudden flash of thought pierced through her mind. Ominous. Unsettling. A message that lingered longer than it should have.

Now then, Elizabeth was *literally alone* in the kingdom at the time. So of course the most logical next step was to challenge a dungeon designed for a full party of adventurers.

Elizabeth managed to solve the first puzzle, pushing through with a spark of brilliance and stubborn will—
...and then she ran out of time.

And then she went bye bye.
