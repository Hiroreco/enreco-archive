The tavern owner turned therapist kicked off her day by diving straight into a session with none other than Gonathon. The topic? The ever-delicate, always-messy realm of love—specifically, the brand of love that involved siblings, mutual friends, and being roped into playing the role of wingman whether you wanted to or not.

Of course, that wouldn’t be the last therapy session of the day. In fact, love became the centerpiece of nearly every conversation the two had throughout the rest of the date. Mordon, ever the professional (in theory), claimed she was simply offering her services—nothing more. Surely, she'd never get caught up in the tangled mess her clients kept dragging into these sessions… right?

Later, she joined Tam, Nerissa, and Gonathon for the day’s main mission—investigating the [Star Site: Chronos](https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=lAhFFA_4EjWnc_FJ&t=4562). And even within the time-twisting, memory-riddled dungeon, she somehow managed to sneak in another [therapy session](https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=P7SB05k5Jd07spd9&t=7538). 

When they recovered the memories of [Ouro Kronii](https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=SEplOgl1s3k3hXcx&t=7906)—who, to Mordon’s surprise, turned out to be the very Tam she was journeying with—Mordon wasted no time offering her [professional support](https://www.youtube.com/live/AVolo2GU708?si=1nQSEO7cubwb8rFH&t=8151) to the newly-remembered time goddess. 

Her eagerness wasn’t just business as usual though—turns out her monopoly was under threat. A rival had appeared. No experience. No credentials. But with prices so low it hurt.

But the real twist came when the very storylines she swore to avoid started dragging her in. Remember all that messy romantic drama Gonathon kept rambling about in therapy? Yeah, Mordon suddenly found herself cast as the “destined love” in a blind date stunt cooked up by her own client—resulting in complete chaos for Gonathon’s actual crush (see [Calli-Gonathon: A Powerful Dynamic](#edge:mori-calliope-gonathon-g-bottom-1-bottom-3)).

And what did Mordon do after throwing the whole table into the air?

She just... left. Off to attend to other business, casually leaving the chaos in her wake.
