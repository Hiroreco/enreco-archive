<!-- title: Frame by Frame -->

The Red Maiden was slowly recovering from the strawberry incident from the day before. The rose she'd been given now hung proudly on her wall—right where it could be seen the moment you stepped in. And the kiss? Still fresh, still warm, or at least, that’s how it lingered in Elizabeth’s mind. Nerissa had absolutely wrecked her mentally—fair to say—but strangely, it wasn’t a bad thing.

Now more composed, Elizabeth no longer turned into a fumbling mess when Nerissa dropped by her little forge home.

They chatted, exchanged playful banter, and commented on each other’s portraits. Nerissa’s, for example, looked as though she was opening her arms for a hug. Sure, Elizabeth still had a few awkward moments, but they were fewer now. The craftsmanship of Nerissa’s portrait was breathtaking, and paired with the subject—Nerissa in all her stunning glory—it was something Elizabeth wanted to frame for the world to admire... and for herself, most of all.

She placed the painting against the side of the building, gently illuminated by the warm glow of shroomlight. But there was still a bit of space left—just enough for one more. Her own portrait.

Elizabeth placed it next to Nerissa’s. Frame by frame, the two stood side by side. It was perfect. A small, quiet thing that made their hearts warm. A simple gesture, yet one that symbolized something far greater.
