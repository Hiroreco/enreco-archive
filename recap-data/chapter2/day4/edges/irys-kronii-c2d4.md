<!-- title: Tyrannical Ruler -->

Turns out, her lil’ Tammy was actually *the* Warden of Time—Ouro Kronii herself—and just like that, IRyS felt her status crumble under the weight of cosmic significance. I mean, what was she known for? Alcoholism? Party tricks? Certainly not timeline maintenance. The [self-esteem crash](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=roD1SAZpIWxklgGw&t=4637) was instant.

This spiraled fast. IRyS, convinced now that her beloved was a tyrannical queen ruling with an iron clock hand (mostly due to Immerkind's gaslighting—and, well, she wasn't 100% wrong), completely lost it. So much so that merely *seeing* Tam again drove her—and the Peasant, for some reason—to attempt a mutual drowning.

But eventually, Tam made an effort to mend the “misunderstanding” (if that’s what we’re calling this whole melodramatic meltdown) by offering [overpriced goods](https://www.youtube.com/live/YVyeKQ-6Ka8?si=mgjYVxEveCtrriA2&t=8287). And just like that, as if nothing ever happened, the two were back in love again.
