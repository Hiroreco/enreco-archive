<!-- title: One And Only -->

Cecilia began her day with purpose in her heart and the Princess in her thoughts. Once more, she sought an audience—captivated by Iphania’s radiance, elegance, and... her scent.

She had made up her mind long ago: she would not give up. Not easily. She would prove herself—through strength, reliability, even wealth. Whatever it took to stand out, to be worthy. All of that? Achievable.

But there was one thing Cecilia couldn’t become: the Outlander.

Following their perilous journey through Star Site: Elpis, she returned to the Princess, eager, almost desperate, to finally be seen. To finally be heard. Yet again, all Iphania could talk about… was [him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=15300s).

Still, Cecilia wasn’t done. If words wouldn’t reach her, maybe actions would. Or better yet—something tangible. A gift. A symbol. Yes! A ring. Surely the Outlander hadn’t thought to give her anything like that yet, the inconsiderate brute. But Cecilia could—would—beat him to it.

She threw herself into the grind, hunting, hoarding, hustling, until finally, she had the coin for the expensive piece of jewelry. A ring befitting royalty, worthy of Iphania’s hand.

She would present it to her. Make her feel cherished. Make her see.

But fate, as always, had other plans.

There was no response. Then came an abrupt call for royal duties—a dentist appointment, of all things. Water spilled. Plates shattered. Chaos unfolded.

It all fell apart.

What was meant to be a shining moment became another quiet failure.

Yet, even now, Cecilia’s heart hadn’t given up. Not completely.
