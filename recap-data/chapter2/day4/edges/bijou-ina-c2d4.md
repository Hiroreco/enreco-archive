<!-- title: Wooden Potato -->

After a period of inactivity since literally the first day, the Potato Club finally gained its third member! â€” a refreshing development after the [indescribable chaos](https://x.com/ninomaeinanis/status/1919824275546190253) while the Hero was slumbering.

With her faith dedicated to the potato fairy, NinoIna had no qualms [turning away](https://youtu.be/l9HKSDG50HM?t=539s) from the "bread"-centric shenanigans of her rambunctious consort eternal. Perhaps the spud's elusive simplicity (and its complex carb goodness) could also shield [others](https://youtu.be/l9HKSDG50HM?t=5046s) who consume it?

POTATO!
