<!-- title: A Rock and a Hard Place -->

While taking a trip to Gacharms to obtain some charms, what started as a casual conversation with Princess Bijou soon took a turn when the young gem revealed to Gonathon the history of her stain [corruption](https://www.youtube.com/live/BSPi8sTHdAY?si=kbE6-YQRyp3CFpJQ&t=715) and theorized that Bae the Peasant might be next. While Gonathon was at first suspicious that Bijou herself might be corrupted, she was soon pacified by Bijou’s assurances and agreed to assist her against Bae should the peasant turn.

Soon after, Gonathon brough Bijou to Mordan’s basement and introduced her to the [Wolf Pack](https://www.youtube.com/live/BSPi8sTHdAY?si=mVR0jSVdL_aFNKuq&t=2616). The knight explained that as the InBreads and Wolves were mortal enemies, that siding with one meant rejecting the other. While Bijou felt she had that dawg in her, she wasn’t sure of where her path lay at the moment. Not wishing to push her further, Gonathon reassured her that no matter what they would remain friends.
 
Sadly, the knight and gem’s interactions took a turn for the awkward later in the day when, following Gonathon’s disastrous fumbling of her relationship with Shiori (See [Gonathon-Shiori: Trials of the Witch](#edge:gigi-shiori-top-2-bottom-1)), the distraught knight was informed by Bijou that not only had she recovered her own memories of her past, but that she and Shiori had reaffirmed their love for one another. While Gonathon does not seem to bear any ill will towards Bijou, this new development could not have come at a worse time.
