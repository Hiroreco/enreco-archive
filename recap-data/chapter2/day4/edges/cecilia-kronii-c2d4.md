<!-- title: Drinks Between Queen and Knight -->

After the conclusion of Star Site: Chronos, Cecilia and friends surround Kronii and shower her with praise. However, the group is appalled to learn that her new status has made her different. Cecilia questions Tammy about whether the [European kisses and drinks shared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=14720s) still matter to her.

Once Immerkind learns the truth of the Outsider, Tam Gandr explains that, thanks to time travel, Iphania and the Outlander could be siblings. This means Cecilia still has a chance, and this moment brings Queen Tam and Cecilia closer.
