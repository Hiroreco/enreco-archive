<!-- title: Severed, but Still There -->

The two had once been bound in matrimony—among the very first to do so, long before this new journey ever began. But due to circumstances no one could have foreseen, Koseki Bijou had decided to sever the bond she once shared with Shiori Novella.

That, however, was a story of the past. And what mattered now... was the present.

After experiencing heartbreak—after reaching out to someone she thought she could capture the heart of—Shiori was left reeling. It was then that Bijou came to offer her condolences. There were no grand gestures, no theatrics, just quiet honesty.

The two reminisced. About the laughter. The sadness. The adventures they’d shared. About the child they once had together. The conversation was soft, grounded—real. And in that stillness, something shifted. A moment that perhaps mended what was once cut. A thread that may yet be rewoven. Maybe, just maybe, there was a chance to begin again.
