<!-- title: The Kind and the Humble Knight -->

Gonathon calls Cecilia to impart critical information concerning the [Princess Bijou and the "In Breads"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=5422s). However, Cecilia calms Gonathon's concerns and declares her full trust with Bijou.

As Cecilia prepared to retire for the night, she receives an urgent call from Gonathon. Realizing how distraught her friend is, she listens intently to the intricate [and complex situation Gonathon found themselves in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGC0VaSUPnE&t=20300s). Cecilia quickly departs from the castle to meet Gonathon.

Cecilia sets Gonathon aside and urgently implores them to think about their own mind and heart. She sends this letter quickly in the hopes that it will remind Gonathon about what's important when they need it most.
