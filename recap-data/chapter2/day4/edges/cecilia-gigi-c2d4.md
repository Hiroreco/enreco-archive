<!-- title: The Kind and the Humble Knight -->

As Cecilia prepared to rest for the night, a sudden, urgent call from Gonathon stirred her from her peace. The tone in his voice told her all she needed to know—this wasn’t just a casual chat. Something was weighing heavily on him.

Where once Gonathon had been her rock, now the roles reversed.

She listened—really listened—as he unraveled the mess of emotions and confusion tied up in his heart. His love life, the tangled threads of his relationships, the uncertainty and hurt that came with it all. Cecilia didn’t offer shallow comfort or forced advice. She simply sat with him in the moment, offering quiet empathy and genuine care. Her presence alone was enough to ease the burden a little.

Maybe it was the "bro bonds" that connected them. Maybe it was something deeper—the shared pain of unspoken feelings and unreciprocated hopes. But whatever it was, it held them together in that moment, unshaken.

It wouldn’t be the last time they’d be there for each other. Not by a long shot.
