<!-- title: The Queen’s Gambit -->

Of all the relationships tested on this day, perhaps none were as prominent as the one between Tam Gandr and her loyal knight. Gonathon accompanied Tam into Star Site Chronos, where, following a series of trials and tribulations, a shocking truth was revealed: Tam was in fact the Queen of Libestal from the future the heroes had originated from, and Gonathon had been her most trusted and ardent follower.

The two shared a heartfelt reunion where Gonathon once again reaffirmed her undying devotion to the queen. This was quickly interrupted by a gaggle of peasants who, having witnessed Tam’s power in the memory, were now seeking to get into her good graces. This sycophancy was short-lived, as the Breads soon attempted to spark a coup to depose Tam. Immediately rushing to her side, Gonathon reassured Tam that she would always support her, which deeply moved Tam.

The darker side of their bond soon reared its ugly head, as Gonathon’s memories of Tam included a supposed Pact of Celibacy she had taken, which flew straight in the face of her burgeoning relationship with Shiori of the Nyavellas (see [Gonathon-Shiori: Trials of the Witch](#edge:gigi-shiori)). Now deeply conflicted, Gonathon would call on Tam several times to provide guidance and permission. This included intervention in a quarrel between Mordan Ramsey and Shiori following a blind date gone wrong and came to a head when Gonathon requested that Tam not only supervise her relationship with Shiori but live with them on the top bunk for at least a year. Unwilling to lose her most treasured and only knight, Tam agreed to the [proposal](https://www.youtube.com/live/BSPi8sTHdAY?si=GZzaSx6FFBlTbIpm&t=12615).

Despite Tam’s best (and worst) efforts, a critical misunderstanding shattered Shiori and Gonathon’s relationship: as she was inspecting the sleeping arrangements with Shiori, a hapless Gonathon witnessed what appeared to be an affair between the two and fled. This led to Shiori giving chase and falling to her death, an action that caused her to break off her romance with Gonathon.

In spite of all of this turmoil, Tam and Gonathon remained committed to one another, with Tam consoling Gonathon and confronting her about her relationship with Mordan Ramsey and Gonathon telling Tam of the wondrous statue the knight had built for her in the future. In a day filled with darkness and grief, the queen’s return was one of the sole shining lights for the knight, but it remains to be seen whether this bond will endure.
