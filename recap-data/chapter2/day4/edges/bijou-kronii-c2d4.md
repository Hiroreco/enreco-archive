<!-- title: Not Again... -->

If I had a nickel for every time Koseki Bijou randomly forced someone of Queenly status into becoming her mother—purely because she considered herself a princess, relation be damned—I’d have three nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but somehow, it’s still way more than it should be.

And Tam—*or* Kronii, by this point—was the third lucky (or unlucky) nickel in that bizarre collection.

Kronii tried to worm her way out of the whole thing, but just like with Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame, the gem maiden was far too cunning, far too slippery, and far too persistent to be shaken off.
