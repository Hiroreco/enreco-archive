## Day 7: The Joy of Life

The day before the finale—when conflicts begin to settle, knots are untied, and long-awaited resolutions unfold. If saving the world and, ultimately, the universe was ever going to happen, it had to be today.

This was the day our heroes confronted their ultimate task: to destroy the Heart of Ruin, the very reason they had come to this world. All 15 gathered together, united in purpose, ready to face the so-called final boss... or so they thought.

Things didn’t go as smoothly. Some fell to curses, turning against their own, forcing the others to bring them back from the brink. Only then did the true antagonist reveal itself—the creeping evil that had long poisoned the land and now threatened to consume all. And even when they triumphed, there lingered an unease, a feeling that this wasn’t truly over. Something still felt... off.

But for now, their mission was complete. And so came the time for resolutions.

Bittersweet closure found its way into Gonathon and Shiori’s story. An unexpected wedding tied together a certain cat lady and her feline partner, Shakira and Roa. A surprisingly heartfelt display of brotherhood emerged between Gonathon and Peasant Bae. Even Elizabeth and Nerissa, for once, shared something more than a witch-themed bickering exchange. Progress—real progress—was made, all rooted in one thing: bonds, connection, and reconciliation.

...Well, almost all.

One storyline stood defiant in its absurdity.

In a day full of meaningful moments, a gender reveal party somehow stole the show in the most chaotic way possible. Yes, Miss Hot Pink One struck again—introducing yet more insanity to the kingdom with her ambiguous stomach situation. While others were weaving connections and building bridges, she was... doing the exact opposite. Her logic remained a mystery, one that seemed less like a riddle and more like a dare to comprehend.

Still, one day remains. Let’s see how it all ends.
