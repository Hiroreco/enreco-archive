<!-- title: Turning To Another -->

A bond as deep and romantic as IRyS and her eternal consort’s was, for many, thought to last forever. Sure, the pink one was a handful, but Ina had always handled her chaos with grace and ease. They were inseparable ever since their very first adventure.

Now, their lives were about to change—forever, and for the better—as the two lovebirds stepped into a new chapter: parenthood.

They exchanged gifts, shared heartfelt words, and with the promise of new life growing between them, their connection felt stronger than ever. Hand in hand, they looked ahead to a future together... until things started getting weird. Fast.

Tam—Tammy—whatever you wanted to call her, couldn’t stand the sight of the Pink One cuddling and fawning over someone else right in front of her. The same Pink One who had once promised love who now had the _audacity_ to ask her to be godfather to a child that wasn't even theirs. It was an insult layered on betrayal.

So Tam did what Tam had to do—she told Ina the truth. That the Pink One had been sneaking around, stringing both of them along, trying to hold onto Ina while keeping Tam in her grasp. It was a desperate attempt to sever the bond between the pink and the purple—and it worked.

Things escalated fast. Tam ordered her knight, Gonathon, to "teach the Pink One a lesson." But instead of accepting defeat, the Pink One turned it into a duel between herself and Gonathon. She could’ve ended it there—but no, for some _unfathomable_ reason, she added a wager: if she lost, she would have her abdomen cut open to check if the so-called child—this gas baby—was actually inside her.

Why.

She lost. And after that, she started losing something far more painful.

Tam moved in, taking advantage of the moment, slowly pulling Ina away from her. She used her [all-powerful rizz](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=6881), her charm, and her presence to win Ina over—and it worked. The Pink One watched as her consort, once hers and hers alone, began to drift further away, inching closer to Tam with every moment.

Desperate, the Pink One enlisted her brother’s help to secretly spy on Ina—to know what she _really_ thought of her. And what she saw shattered her completely.

Ina wanted to be with Tam instead.

Something within her broke. Something dark, obsessive, and primal. She would do anything to take her consort back. Anything.
