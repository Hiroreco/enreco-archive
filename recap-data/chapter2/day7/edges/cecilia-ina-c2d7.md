<!-- title: The Knight and the Hero -->

Cecilia and NinoIna had only shared passing interactions, but they were always cordial. Whether it was singing the song of the Hearts of the Kingdom or sharing pleasantries, their relationship remained one of respect. But today, Cecilia leaned on the wisdom of the hero NinoIna.

NinoIna and Cecilia depart for the training grounds [to spar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYTiK9cm_bo&t=6470s) in preparation for the final battle. Their bond grows as close as the clashing of their swords in the distant field.

After having cleared the Heart of Ruins, Cecilia seeks NinoIna's counsel in order to sort out the feelings of her heart.

Cecilia returns the favor by [checking in on NinoIna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYTiK9cm_bo&t=10940s) as well when she hears that there are troubles with NinoIna's love life.

Suddenly, an announcement rings through the land, and Cecilia learns that her cousin, Shakira, and Roa are getting married! She brings her trusty ukulele and plays a tune, which NinoIna eagerly jumps in to sing along with.
