<!-- title: From One Witch to Another -->

**[FROM ONE WITCH TO ANOTHER](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=3624)**

Shiori and Nerissa sat down at the campfire behind Shiori’s house. It had been a while since they caught up and chatted, and it felt nice and familiar since Nerissa had regained all her memories. Much to Shiori’s surprise, Nerissa had no problem with the memory she had given to the raven; she believed it had some truth to it. Unlike the knight Lady Bloodflame, she was not so hostile and quick to call Shiori a liar. 

With this in mind, Shiori thought it best to tell Nerissa about the confrontation Lady Bloodflame had brought upon her. The blue raven did not know of the scarlet knight's actions, telling the two-toned witch that she did no wrong. In fact, one should not view Shiori so negatively for her memories as she had remembered them. 

***Are you truly a witch?***

Nerissa confirmed, indeed she was a witch. Unsure if she was one before, she knew now that this is who she is. If that is how the people perceive her to be, then a witch she shall be. The two witches agreed, the world is cruel. Thus, Shiori now had a fellow witch! How lovely to know that there is someone who shared much more in common than she once thought. 

***The Covenant***

Shiori offered Nerissa a pact— like a good neighbor, State Farm is there! They had both agreed, forming the first witch coven in Libestal. They would look out for each other, for their own kind. Both were open to recruiting other witches, the more the merrier! The two witches believed it would be beneficial to everyone, both glad they could come to such an agreement. 

As they departed, Nerissa wished Shiori luck on her party planning, and Shiori wished Nerissa luck on her toxic yuri with the not-so-noble knight, Lady Bloodflame.
