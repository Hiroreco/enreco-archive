<!-- title: Loyal Knight's Vow -->

Cecilia makes the decision to stay by the princess's side. Even if Iphania does not love her in return, [she will continue to protect her.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYTiK9cm_bo&t=1696s)

She writes a letter for the [final night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYTiK9cm_bo&t=4431s) before the next day. The journey is about to come to an end.
