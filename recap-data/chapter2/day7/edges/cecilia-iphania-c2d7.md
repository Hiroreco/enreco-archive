<!-- title: Loyal Knight's Vow -->
<!-- relationship: Protector -->

After the tear-soaked storm that had been the day before, Cecilia found herself in stillness—finally able to think, to breathe, to reflect.

And in that clarity, she made her choice.

Even if the Princess did not return her love, even if her feelings remained unanswered, Cecilia would [stay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYTiK9cm_bo&t=1696s). Not as a lover, but as a knight. As someone who once loved, and still does, deeply. Because those feelings were real. The heartstrings that tugged every time Iphania smiled—those were real. The warmth she felt simply being near her—that was real. And even if those days were now memories, they were the happiest days of her life.

For Cecilia, Iphania had always been her light.

And so, with the end of the journey drawing near, she penned her final letter to the Princess—not as a confession, but as a quiet declaration. A vow not bound by romance, but by conviction.

No matter what came next, no matter how the story ended—

She would protect her.
Until the very end.
