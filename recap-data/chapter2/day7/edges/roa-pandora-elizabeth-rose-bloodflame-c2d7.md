<!-- title: Love Unlasting -->

The [dissonance](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=509) between the two was painful at times. Where Roa saw a married future, Elizabeth saw a comrade to fight beside. Perhaps it was this difference that made Roa's inevitable heartbreak all the more pitiful.

Throughout the course of the day, Roa would continue yesterday's attempts at pursuing Elizabeth to hopefully propose and marry her. But Elizabeth's sense of romance was nearly nonexistent. She never noticed Roa's love, only showing confusion when Roa's jealousy erupted or when she ran crying.

This tragic love saga finally closed its chapter when Roa witnessed Nerissa and Elizabeth's date in the onsen. The two spoke too fondly, in a tone Roa rarely heard from the Knight. Only then did Roa accept that her love would never be reciprocated in the way she had dreamed.

Despite not noticing Roa's affections, the Red Knight [cared very much](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=453) for her comrade, showing concern whenever the cat feigned illness. Not once did Elizabeth doubt Roa's words; the trust she had in her was apparent.
