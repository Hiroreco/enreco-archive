Somehow, *somehow*, *somehow*, for reasons beyond comprehension, events took a turn that words could barely begin to capture. In an attempt to figure out whether the pink one’s child was Ina’s, the result… somehow\... pointed to Ina *and* Tam being the parents? No, wait—*all three* of them? Or was Tam the godfather? Or... what?

It was chaos. Absolute chaos.

Then, out of nowhere, Tam confessed that she “quite liked” Ina—right in front of the pink one’s face. You’d think it was a joke. You’d think Ina, who had just pledged eternal love to her consort, would laugh it off. But no. Ina, who swore to stand by the pink one forever, was... swayed?

What?

Then somehow, this spiraled into Ina and Tam having an impromptu therapy session at Mordon’s place. There, they vented—about how the pink one had hurt them both and about how Ina bonding with Tam would make things incredibly messy, considering Tam was Bijou’s mother and Bijou was Ina’s sister. So if you start connecting the dots...

Yeah. What is even happening?

In the end, Ina decided she’d figure out [later](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y_f17MHHHzc?t=9796) whether she would stay with the pink one.

What.
