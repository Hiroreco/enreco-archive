<!-- title: A Bridge Too Far -->

Bae was worried for Cecilia at first; The Princess and the Outlander left in a tender moment. Something that was clearly more than platonic (perhaps, incestual) love. Nonetheless, Bae pushed through. She waited by the bridge, letter in hand and roses ready. Finally, Bae gave Cecilia her confession. Bae watched patiently as Cecilia read her letter, the kind knight's voice faltering every so often. When Cecilia finished reading, Bae kneeled and presented her flowers, answering any question Cecilia asked her.

[Yes, it is you.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4740)

There was no need to mince words or prolong a painful moment: Bae's love was for naught, for Immerkind, though thankful for Bae's feelings, must follow her own heart for the princess. Cecilia will stay in Libestal. Perhaps, one day, she and Bae may meet again and then they can talk. They parted, once friendly companions now sorely strained.

To call it "hurtful" would be to downplay it. For Bae, it was devastating.

She had held back for so long—keeping herself closed off from others ever since the first journey. And now, when she had finally dared to hope, dared to feel something real for someone, dared to believe in warmth again… that hope had been crushed. That warmth turned to ice. Her world—internal and external—collapsed into despair.

So much so that she descended into the abyss, both in spirit and in body, ready to surrender to the cold depths.

...

But then—a hand reached out.

Not Immerkind’s. No, someone else. Someone who had seen her. Heard her. Understood her.

Perhaps, after all, Bae had made a real connection. Perhaps there was someone whose hand would never let go.
