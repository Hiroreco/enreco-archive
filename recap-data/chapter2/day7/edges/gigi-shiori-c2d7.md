<!-- title: The Moon Sets so the Sun May Rise -->

["Nice to meet you."](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1769) It is a phrase all too familiar to Gonathon, whether she realizes it or not. Arriving at Shiori's house, Gonathon once again faced one whom she had previously loved, but now saw as a stranger. This time, Gonathon responded almost casually, a resigned sense of acceptance filling her voice as she conversed with Shiori. Expecting to find a book waiting for her, the amnesiac archiver responded in confusion, pointing the knight to Mordan Ramsey, who had bought the book by mistake.

Arriving home, Gonathon found a chest waiting for her with the book inside. The book directed her to a hidden site behind her tree, where a number of items related to Shiori's now removed memories could be found. While Gonathon collected these items, she did not have time to go over them. For Shiori of the Nyavellas was now requesting Gonathon's aid in the new farm area, and, determined to not let a chance to converse with her slip her by, eagerly agreed.

Arriving at the farming area, Gonathon once again met up with Shiori. Gonathon demonstrated her knightly prowess to Shiori by protecting her and mining items for her. Then, under the watchful eye of the moon, the two sat together and began to converse. Shiori revealed that she did indeed remember a form of Gonathon, her "true" self who the archiver simply referred to as "G." Questioning why Gonathon was not with her usual friends and gang, the knight responded that she was still unsure of who she was, and what she wanted for her story.

With the sun's playful rays beginning to peek out from the horizon, the conversation turned to memories. [Shiori remarked](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4297) that she preferred to seal painful memories away, rather than bear their burden. Gonathon retorted by stating that, regardless of whether Shiori remembered her or not, she knew the archiver was truly kind. Realizing the burden that Shiori bore as an archiver, Gonathon stated that no one could have the answer to everything, as this was a burden too great to shoulder alone. The conversation ended on a peaceful note, with Gonathon promising to fight by Shiori and the archiver wishing to meet the knight again.

Following the epic clash with the Heart of Ruin, in which Gonathon assisted in purifying a curse placed on the archiver, and a jovial meal at Hot Pink One's party, Gonathon finally turned to the letters Shiori had left for her. The last words the witch had left for her thanked Gonathon for all the time they had spent together and implored the Humble Knight to live not just for the sake of others, but also for herself.

Moved by Shiori's words, Gonathon thought back to her time with Bae (see [Bae-Gonathon](#edge:bae-gigi)) and decided that she, too, would set out on a journey of self-discovery. And with this, it seemed that the blank slate between archiver and knight was set to have a new set of memories etched upon it, free of the dark reminders of the past.

Alas, this was not to be as Shiori uncovered the diaries from the previous days, their contents revealing the blackest depths of her encounters with Gonathon. Requesting that Gonathon speak with her, it appeared that history was set to repeat itself in the most tragic way imaginable. But it was here that the noble knight truly took her first steps towards a brighter future. Meeting face to face with the Archiver once more, Gonathon owned up to the sins she had committed and apologized for the way she had used Shiori as a means of escaping the pain of her lost love.

Most important of all for the Humble Knight was the kindness that Shiori gave her, both before and after losing her memories. Gonathon made one final request: that the two continue to speak like this. Departing on a melancholy but fulfilling note, the two promised to meet each other at the banquet tomorrow. And thus, the tale of the fumbling knight had ended. Where the story of Shiori of the Nyavellas goes next is unclear, but one thing is certain. Their story together is far from over.
