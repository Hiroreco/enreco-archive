<!-- title: The Cat and The Cat Woman -->

*It was a match made in heaven.*

After Roa's numerous failed attempts at pursuing Elizabeth, it seemed as though she wasn't destined to find true love. If anything, the past few days had taught her it was not going to come sweeping her off her feet easily. She'd have to try harder. The same could be said about Kiara. Early on, she was attracted to Ceciliaâ€”and that had already burned to the ground. While she tried to laugh off seeing everyone else around her happy, *loneliness had begun to devour her*.

So, when Kiara tried to show Roa all the flowers Elizabeth had given her, Roa misunderstood the situation and ran away! Kiara immediately came around to reassure her with soothing, warm headpats that comforted the panther.


Kiara asked Roa if she knew anyone looking for love, wherein she proudly exclaimed that she was a cat lover. 

Up till this point, the two were just friends. But there, in that moment, Kiara said something unexpected that would change their lives forever.

An impromptu wedding ceremony was arranged! Everyone, from all over the kingdom, despite the short notice, was invited.
