<!-- title: Love Unlasting -->

The [dissonance](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=509) between the two was painful at times. Where Roa saw a married future, Elizabeth saw a comrade to fight beside. Perhaps it was this difference that made Roa's inevitable heartbreak all the more pitiful.

Throughout the day, Roa continued her earnest pursuit—hopeful, determined, perhaps a little desperate. Yesterday's almost-confession still lingered on her lips, and today she tried again. She offered gifts, warned Elizabeth of Shiori's [suspicious behavior](https://www.youtube.com/live/m2OG5auudrQ?si=oX6O9t543B3Kn7Ha&t=2982), did everything she could think of to win over the elusive Red Knight.

But love, unfortunately, was not something Elizabeth seemed to recognize—at least not in the way Roa hoped.

Her gestures were met not with warmth, but with blank stares. Tilted heads. Awkward silences. Roa's feelings, no matter how loud or heartfelt, simply didn’t reach her.

Because within the Red Knight’s heart… there was already [someone else](https://www.youtube.com/live/m2OG5auudrQ?si=Cgu4CvT-TAqFRUmK&t=4815).

And for all the affection Roa tried to give, the only response she received was quiet confusion—never recognition. Never understanding.

In the end, love unreturned was love unseen.

This tragic love saga finally closed its chapter when Roa witnessed Nerissa and Elizabeth's date in the onsen. The two spoke too fondly, in a tone Roa rarely heard from the Knight. Only then did Roa accept that her love would never be reciprocated in the way she had dreamed.

Despite not noticing Roa's affections, the Red Knight [cared very much](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=453) for her comrade, showing concern whenever the cat feigned illness. Not once did Elizabeth doubt Roa's words; the trust she had in her was apparent.

...Quite anti-climatic isn't it? Well, she immediately got married to another, in the same day no less (see [Shakira-Roa](#edge:raora-kiara))

Yay for happy ending?
