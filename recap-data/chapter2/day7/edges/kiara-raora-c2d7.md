<!-- title: The Cat and The Cat Woman -->
<!-- relationship: Marriage -->

_It was a match made in heaven._

After Roa's numerous failed attempts at pursuing Elizabeth, it seemed as though she wasn't destined to find true love. If anything, the past few days had taught her it was not going to come sweeping her off her feet easily. She'd have to try harder. The same could be said about Kiara. Early on, she was attracted to Ceciliaâ€”and that had already burned to the ground. While she tried to laugh off seeing everyone else around her happy, _loneliness had begun to devour her_.

So, when Kiara tried to show Roa all the flowers Elizabeth had given her, Roa misunderstood the situation and [Roa left crying!](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=5845) But Kiara was quick to follow her, giving [her pets](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=5878) and emphasizing she wasn't Roa's rival. The flowers Kiara received were a sign of **friendship** since she had never received any before.

Kiara asked Roa if she knew anyone looking for love, wherein she proudly exclaimed that she was a cat lover.

Up till this point, the two were just friends. But there, in that moment, Kiara said something unexpected that would change their lives forever.

In a rather surprising turn of events, it seemed like Kiara was a forerunner for Roa's heart. Both of them spent more time together throughout the day and even [commissioned a memory and a story from Shiori.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=10472) Roa would cheer for Kiara as the Orange Knight dueled.

An impromptu wedding ceremony was arranged! Everyone, from all over the kingdom, despite the short notice, was invited.
