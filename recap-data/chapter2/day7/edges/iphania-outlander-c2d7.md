<!-- title: An Eerie Victory -->

It was finally over. The Heart of Ruin was destroyed, the Curse lifted, and the world—saved.

The expressions on their faces spoke of peace, of the weight that had been lifted. At last, they no longer had to fear a doomed fate.

And yet... something felt *off*.

The mysteries hadn't vanished with the Ruin. Instead, an unease lingered—subtle but unmistakable. Was something deeper still lurking beneath the surface?

It could be nothing. It could be everything. Maybe they were saving it all for the final banquet. Maybe they were just overwhelmed. Or maybe... this is where the real story begins.

The final day awaited. And with it, perhaps, the real answers.
