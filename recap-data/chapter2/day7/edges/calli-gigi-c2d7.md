After Gonathon learned that it was Mordan who had mistakenly purchased the book Shiori had asked to be retrieved the previous day, Gonathon quietly retreated to bed, antsy about the message soon to be revealed. As Gonathon began reading, casually quipping about Mordan’s little “oopsies,” fate, ever fond of irony, brought Mordan herself to [appear in proximity,](https://www.youtube.com/live/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=1554) wandering near the tree unaware she was even being spoken of. She approached the chest she had left for Gonathon, confirming the book had indeed been received.

“All is well in the kingdom. That’s all I need to know. All I needed to know. I am happy for my friend. You should be happy for your friends. In this life, where we only get so many chances to be with our friends, perhaps the best idea is to put aside selfish desires. Selfish desires? I’m being silly; I don’t feel those things. I don’t feel emotions. Only lust for money, fo-sho. Okay, maybe not lust for money, but definitely love for my pack.”

In a previous conversation between Mordan, Shiori, and Bijou, Mordan had not realized her purchase history was visible in the market chest. Her secret deed thus exposed, she eventually confessed to buying the book in error. And yet, one wonders, was it truly an accident? Or had Mordan, perhaps subconsciously, attempted to delay Gonathon’s receipt of it? As she reflected on all that had transpired since that moment, her lingering affections for her wolf brother Gonathon, not least among them, Mordan seemed to accept her lonely role in this tragic kingdom.

Around the time of the new dungeon’s opening, during a kerfuffle among the heroes of Libestal, a small gesture towards Gonathon somehow led Mordan to even deeper despair. [Offering food to Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=7889s) in preparation for the upcoming battle, she was met with silence, leading her to believe that Gonathon was giving her the cold shoulder:

“Gonathon doesn’t want anything to do with me. That’s fine, whatever. I don’t care; I don’t have emotions. I don’t have emotions... Yeah, what a shame, ignored by my own wolf brother. That’s messed up.”

A simple misunderstanding or miscommunication, perhaps, but for a heart already cracked by unrequited love and perceived rejection, the sting was undeniable.

Much later in the day, both Mordan and Gonathon found themselves together once more, standing before the auction block as Tam Gandr recounted her latest romantic woes. Listening intently, Mordan and Gonathon offered what counsel they could. In a quiet gesture that betrayed her own wounded heart, Mordan offered Tam a “Gorgeous Ring,” the very same she had intended to give Gonathon only days prior.

Sensing the heaviness in Mordan’s voice, Gonathon gently sought to lift her spirits. Gonathon, along with Tam, reminded her of all she had built in this Libestal: her chef activities, her tavern, her therapy business, and now her business as a realtor. Gonathon considered Mordan the “most qualified person in this kingdom,” even proposing she learn medicine so that she might help during emergencies, referencing the recent chaos surrounding the Hot Pink One. With so few hands available in the kingdom, Mordan acknowledges being able to fit many kinds of roles for different circumstances.

And yet, despite her many accomplishments, there was no denying that a sadness lingered in her heart. Mordan had been unsuccessful in love, unsuccessful in previously courting Gonathon, and uncertain in her role in the kingdom, and in turn left, hoping that others might find what she could not.

[“Like all things, a broken heart can be mended”](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=16989) she said softly as advice to Tam. Perhaps, just perhaps, the advice she gave was not only meant for Tam but also for herself.
