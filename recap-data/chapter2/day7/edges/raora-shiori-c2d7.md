<!-- title: A Witch's Cat -->

Throughout the day, Roa constantly sought Shiori's advice. She heeded the Archiver's word, even [defending her character](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2906) when Elizabeth, Roa's first love, was wary of Shiori.

Roa thought Shiori was kind and a good friend, she [comforted Roa](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=11454) when she was upset, and encouraged her pursuit of love. They met underneath Gonathan's tree, and Roa told Shiori of her pain. A love that ended with a whimper that the Red Knight never heard. Shiori comforted her, giving her pats as she reassured the cat that she would find someone much better one day. Roa had always appreciated Shiori's kindness.

Later, during Roa and Kiara's wedding, [Shiori would walk Roa down the aisle](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10583).
