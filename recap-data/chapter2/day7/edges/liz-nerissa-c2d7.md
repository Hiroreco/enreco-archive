<!-- title: Forgive or Forget -->

**_"Artificial Stars."_**

While everyone was busy filling themselves with food, they were merry in the company of one another.

Elizabeth separated herself from the crowd, while Nerissa followed. When she noticed her, the knight mentioned she was making some [fireworks](https://youtu.be/sDjysXFWYbI?t=10435), to which the maiden replied it was a good idea and said she too would make one for herself.

The lady knight, yearning for more of her presence, stopped her from leaving, giving her quite a lot of her own. Nerissa claimed it was her first time doing it, and so did Lady Bloodflame, but she offered to test them out together on the roof. Just the two of them.

And so they did… however, it was already morning, so they had to postpone it till evening.

Fate must have been too cruel, for it didn’t prove successful. Nerissa needed to gather some more ingredients, and when the sun finally gave way to the moon, she caught Elizabeth testing the fireworks with Rao Pandora.

Her heart has already grown cold. She shouldn't be affected any longer...

**_"Skin to skin."_**

An onsen. A place to relax and unwind. A request not to be inappropriate.

Nerissa and Elizabeth find themselves across from one another, chatting lightly in the comforting heat of the water.

The idea of [personal space is temporarily lost](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=11173) as Nerissa's voice dips sultry and sweet. Honeyed and sinful. The way she speaks as she inches closer and closer until they are face-to-face. If either leaned forward even just a hair, their lips might touch.

Another sweet giggle in her ear has Nerissa backing away from Elizabeth—the strawberry curse returns. Suddenly, Nerissa is getting out without warning, leaving Elizabeth scrambling to do the same and get dressed.

That voice echoed in the back of her skull for a moment.

**_Loyalty to an Evil King._**

Every angle feels like it's suffocating Elizabeth with these questions. Would she once again dedicate herself to the corrupt King? She is...a knight. Who pledges her loyalty to the King. But if he's corrupt, is it the right thing to do? Do you betray your King or follow in his shadow of darkness?

The harsh recall of memory. Nerissa asked her why she would stand by the King after he betrayed them. As he hurt them all. As she heard Mococo's pained cry her sister fell for just a moment.

A question left unanswered in the end. Elizabeth doesn't know the right path for a knight. For her. Despite having experienced that path once.

**_"You were in my home."_**

[The sudden tone is dark.](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=11611) Nerissa sounds angry. Hurt. Elizabeth stumbles over her words a bit. "It was to protect you! I-I wouldn't break and enter unless I had reason!"

After all, Elizabeth had been the one tricked!

4 replaced discs. 200 gold to help fix a broken door—a rose without reason.

Suddenly, a soft laugh breaks the heavy tension. Nerissa isn't angry, just teasing. Relief settles over Elizabeth's shoulders at that.

After all, it was done to ensure Nerissa's safety. A proper knight would knock and await an answer. Not bash down a door in a brazen move without just cause.

_I dare not trust your words, but you are a danger - so locked up you must._

**_"The monster behind me now stands before you."_**

The recent development in their relationship would have probably made one maiden’s heart swoon. Elizabeth had started warming up to her— following her around, giving her gifts, showering her with praises, and making sure she was well and protected.

She even called her beautiful. And promised she would always stay by her side…

But it was too late.

If only the scarlet knight had realized a bit earlier… she would’ve folded and lowered her defenses. However, thorns have already grown on the flesh of this delicate rose. Every warm and gentle touch would sting deeper, making it ever more painful to bear.

The cards had been flipped. Elizabeth was oblivious to the menacing side of the person she was falling for. As if entranced by the siren’s sweet song, she moved according to the witch’s will.

Defenseless. Vulnerable. On the palm of the monster she created.
