<!-- title: Mococo Abyssguard -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Don’t you just love it when you’ve barely woken up and someone’s already asking you for therapy? Well, that’s exactly what happened to the kingdom’s newly renowned therapist, Mococo.

She listened intently, jotting down notes with utmost focus, putting her years of absolutely zero experience and total lack of license to good use—all to give her client the very best their nonexistent payment could buy.

Energetic start aside, Mococo’s day started to feel... off. She’d been feeling a little unwell the day before, but somehow, resting hadn’t done much. If anything, it made things worse. Dizzy, nauseated, and unsure of what was happening, she confided in Roa, who offered her a bed and some [comforting words](https://www.youtube.com/live/AxQVdUrmVZU?si=yPqtSKek3669499D&t=875). Hopefully, it would pass.

Elizabeth, however, didn’t help at all—dealing emotional damage with a perfectly timed remark about how everyone else was getting flowers while Mococo got [absolutely nothing](https://www.youtube.com/live/AxQVdUrmVZU?si=kWwjl2iiHwWWZCCd&t=3394).

Still, there was no skipping out now. She had to join the others for the final dungeon, and of course, the party they were all invited to—even if she still had no clue what it was actually for.

She gathered at the dungeon’s entrance with the rest of the heroes, but the moment they stepped inside, something snapped.

Mococo, along with four others, was cursed—forced to turn against her comrades. Thankfully, they managed to snap out of it with the help of everyone else. Together, they destroyed the Curse, saved the world... and oddly enough, Mococo didn’t feel sick anymore. Strange, but hey, she was feeling great now.

Refreshed and riding high on post-victory adrenaline, she went ahead and challenged everyone to duels. Because why not? Unfortunately, while her mouth talked a big game, her body couldn’t quite keep up—she challenged two people and lost [both matches](https://www.youtube.com/live/AxQVdUrmVZU?si=brpDCiHHjSM7FCf5&t=7451).

So now she was left with all this pent-up frustration from losing back-to-back... she had to release it _somehow_. Oh? The Hot Pink One’s throwing a party? Perfect. And she has a child now?

Excellent. A perfect target for her claws to unleash fury upon, just like old times.
