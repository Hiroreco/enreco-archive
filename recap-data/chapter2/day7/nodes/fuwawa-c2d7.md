It's party day! The commission Shiori gave Fuwawa was finally due, and it was time for her to gather all her best dishes for the special event.

Roa, Nerissa, Elizabeth—many were [excited](https://www.youtube.com/live/eKVBp9EgDLc?t=2104) to taste her food, which gave her all the motivation she needed to start preparing. She foraged, harvested, and cooked up chicken, cakes, salads—every kind of cuisine she could think of.

But before the event, there was one last thing she had to do: finish the final dungeon, the whole ["saving the world"](https://www.youtube.com/live/eKVBp9EgDLc?t=5273) ordeal. So she joined the remaining heroes, got possessed and fought her comrades, got saved, fought the final boss, and helped save the world. You know, the minor stuff. She promptly left to get back to her real priority—finishing her preparations.

Fuwawa had come a long way since the early days of dreaming about a humble stall where her food could make people smile. She had faced moments of doubt, times when she felt like giving up, but she stayed strong. Her perseverance paid off—from one customer to many, from earning nothing to raking in thousands of coins. None of it would’ve been possible without her dedication—and the friends who stood by her in her darkest times. She felt deeply grateful to them.

The party began. Fuwawa brought all the food she’d prepared—an impressive spread. It was... definitely a [strange party](https://www.youtube.com/live/eKVBp9EgDLc?t=8786), to say the least. Fuwawa didn’t quite understand most of what was going on, but what really mattered to her was whether people enjoyed her cooking.

She moved through the crowd, [offering](https://www.youtube.com/live/eKVBp9EgDLc?t=9248) samples of her dishes—and the response was overwhelmingly positive. Everyone loved it.

Fuwawa was happy. It was a special day, and she wouldn’t trade it for the world.
