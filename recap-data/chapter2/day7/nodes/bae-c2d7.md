There was a sense of finality in the air. The last fight that would decide Libestal's fate was near... and soon, Bae's confession. Death or life, love or rejection; it all weighed heavily on Bae's heart.

And a few things to finish, such as [Khaos and The Other One's room.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=489). A few decorations that could be won from the gacha would suit the children's room nicely.

Bae was elated and nervous as she and [Cecilia spoke](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=323). So much to say in so little time, but they promised to watch each other's back in this final endeavour. Bae tried to hint her romantic intentions, a hint that gracefully went over Cecilia's head. Doubt rised within Bae, can she really win the heart of one Miss Immerkind? Mother, whoever Mother was, said "With love comes heartbreak". Was it worth it to pursue a fruitless feat? [Voices in her head spoke](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=783): Yes, closure.

Bolstered by the voices, Bae called Gonathon to talk about their plan, refining the details to a tee. When Bae is ready, she would send a signal to Gonathon via phone, then Gonathon would bring Cecilia by the bridge in the first Remnant Field. But as [Bae waited for Time to arrive](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=1962), doubt lingered to which Gonathon, a true comrade and friend, reassured her that all will be fine, later mentioning the jest that Iphania was Fia (a joke Cecilia heard from Shiori) would help Bae's chances. But, as Bae checked her inventory, her letter was _gone_... [and tucked in a safe place,](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2645) back in one of the chests at home. After keeping the letter within her person, Bae showed Gonathon him the children's soon-to-be room. It was still a work in progress, a literal hole in the wall, but Bae would see it finished the journey ends.

A sense of excitement filled the air as they wait for Queen Tam to arrive; [Bae watched](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2160) as Mordan announced her auction while the Hot Pink One and a few others nearby were quite ill. At the corner of her eye, Immerkind was nearby. And the Hero, Ina. Bae, inspired by the gallant way Ina had fought in the Illusory Libestal, promised to do her part. Flattered, Ina agreed, after all, Bae was also fighting for those she cherish. Bae _is_ a Hero worth her salt.

But, it seemed a certain pink one might have something _more_ than constipation. Words such as "raise", "sickness", and "life-altering changes" reached Bae's ears. The pieces connected... _IRyS_ was **pregnant**.

[Then Gonathon Raised Another Concern](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2782)

Bae paused. _Is_ there anyone in the kingdom qualified to help with childbi-

The thought discarded by Queen Tammy's _timely_ arrival!

Ruination was at their doorsteps and the heroes took charge. A sense of trepidation filled Bae as laughter filled the dungeon's library. A strange glow surrounded Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori as they flew in the air. The curse from yesterday lingered as an **Advent** of darkness was upon them. But it seems the purification was simple enough, defeating the Stains that littered the dungeon seemed to help. Bae faced [their attacks](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=3445) best she could, eventually her friends were rescused.

[The Curse](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=3693)

Perhaps the fiercest opponent Bae had faced, but not one she couldn't defeat, especially with the combined efforts of all our heroes. Soon, [Libestal was free from Ruin.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4009) And a [small doll too](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4051), one that looked remarkably like Fia. Bae watched teary eyed as Iphania took Fia into her arms. The last gift the princess gave to her father had finally returned to her.

One last challenge was left before Bae's day was over. Love (see [Bae-Cecilia](#edge:cecilia-bae)).

...

She was rejected.

Swiftly, Gonathon was by Bae's side, a witness to her heartbreak (see [Bae-Gigi](#edge:bae-gigi)).

With love, and Cecilia, behind her, Bae witnessed the... party. Slightly awkward as others may have known about her recent plight, Bae reassured all that she was fine, even introducing IRyS to her [abandoned nephew.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5633) Soon the party started and, tradition at this point, drama ensued. Queen Tammy [rejecting the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5761), Gonathon jumping at his Queen's defence.

[... Who was going to deliver the child?](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5883)

Ignoring _that_, [Bae looked for the Queen](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5936), inquiring about the authencity of the rumours. Bae watched reassured as Queen Tam admired herself, it seemed all was fine now and that the Queen would stay in Libestal. Hearing that, Bae couldn't help but feel disappointed, since she would leave to find her Box. Bae left to give them some privacy as Tammy's therapy session would soon begin.

A series of events quickly followed: a gassy girl born [(the less said, the better)](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=6744) and quickly lost, the Hot Pink One's failing marriage, a duel that resulted in the Hot Pink One's dissection, and ending in [a wonderful wedding](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=7715) between Kiara and Roa.

Finally, Bae went to finalize the room for her children, Khaos and The Other One. Before long, it was done; it was warm and comfortable with plenty of supplies to keep them fed; [Bae even won 2 figures from the gacha](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=8199) after 36 attempts! Bae commerated this moment with Gonathon and Bijou, fellow State Farmers, proudly showing them her hard work.

[Kids' Room](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=9402)

[And The Other One is named... Chaoz](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=9475)

But alas, with every high in life, there are lows, for [Bae was scammed](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=10289), and her endeavours in [fireworks did not spark colour in her life](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=11047).

Perhaps the morrow would be a more joyous occasion for the Peasant The Bae.
