The Peasant The Bae's day began once again. Soon, it will be her final day in this strange foreign land wherein she had seen many ups and downs in her life; hopefully, today will end in the peaks of romance. Cecilia Immerkind. And apparently, an It's Gas! party.

Bae was elated and nervous as she and [Cecilia spoke](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=323). It's been a while, and soon they'll make their way into the final stages of their adventure. To hopefully hint at her intentions, Bae asked if they could save the world together (in exactly 24 minutes), to which Cecilia would respond enthusiastically. Though if she caught the intent behind the words, it wasn't shown.

A brave Hero Bae may have become, she became a mother as well. She still has to [finish the room for Khaos and The Other One](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=489). Perhaps she can add a small decoration to the room as well. One gacha box that the shopkeepers were selling had an opportunity to win a small figurine.

As she did her quests one final time, Bae fretted over Cecilia. She knew of the Kind Knight's passion and devotion to Princess Iphania, and it seemed she wasn't reciprocating Bae's hints. Doubt began to build up in Bae's heart. Mother, whoever 'Mother' is to Bae at this point, mentioned 'with love comes heartbreak,' and, indeed, Bae's endeavor would most likely end in failure. Was there a reason why she should go through with her confession? [Voices in her head spoke](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=783): Closure.

She called Gonathan, a comrade who had stuck by her through everything, though it seemed the knight was busy with his affairs in the morning. But they met soon enough at the wagon where they waited for others to begin the final leg of their journey. They refined their plan: Bae would send a call to Gonathan to signal she was ready by the [Bridge in the first Remnant field](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=1903), and Gonathan, when he received that call, would immediately bring Cecilia there.

It seemed there were still a few more people missing from their party, and Bae took this chance to [watch the rest mingle](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2160). Mordan announced her auction while the Hot Pink One and a few others were feeling ill. Immerkind was also quite nearby. And another person. The Hero, NinoIna. [Bae talked to Ina](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2395), telling the Hero of her admiration when they fought the first time, back in the illusory Libestal. How Ina fought on, her gallant back shining. Ina, flattered, reminded Bae: Fight for those you cherish.

Energized, Bae agreed. But doubts lingered. She pulled Gonathan aside, and the Good Knight reassured her that he believes Bae does have a chance. As if summoned, Immerkind came by. Bae and Gonathan immediately changed the subject, and Bae checked her inventory to find that her letter was missing. 

*Her letter was missing*... [in a safe place](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2645). It was merely in a chest in her PP Hole for safekeeping. She quickly took it with her and showed Gonathan the beginnings of the room she was excavating for her ~~daughters~~ sons. Gonathan would then bring up the chance that Iphania was Fia (a jest Shiori originally told Cecilia to mess with her.) Immerkind would not love the cat romantically, so Bae still may have a chance to win her heart.

On their way back to the wagon, Bae and Gonathan would hear the words "raise..." and the pieces began to connect: sickness, 'raise', and 'life-altering changes.' IRyS was pregnant.

[But then Gonathan Raised Another Concern](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=2782)

Bae paused. *Is* there anyone in the kingdom qualified to help with childbi-

Oh, Queen Tammy has awoken! The hero Ina took the lead, counting to ensure everyone was ready. It was time.

A series of bookshelves were in the dungeon, with books that told of... betrayal? Evil laughter echoed from Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori. There was a strange glow to them as they flew. It is the **Advent** of our heroes' challenge as they must find a way to purify their friends and destroy the Ruination.

The books were meaningless; there were no hints, but soon Bae found they [must leave the room first](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=3246), where they now found themselves in a series of platforms filled with Stains. With each Stain defeated, the purification grew, but their cursed comrades would try to [sabotage them](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=3445). Eventually, they succeeded in saving their friends.

[But there was a final challenge: The Curse](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=3693)

It was the fiercest opponent our heroes had faced, as thorns would erupt everywhere from the dungeon. Curses would hit them, almost blackening their hearts. But it did not matter; the heroes have come too far to let it win. Even as the Curse attempted to heal itself, it could not compete with the fierce attacks that rained down. 

[Libestal Saved](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4009)

It was over. Their journey has finally come to an end. The Outlander and Princess Iphania soon arrived, thanking everyone for overturning Fate and saying that Libestal was in their debt. But another sweet moment would be had: [The Princess took a fallen doll into her arms](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4051). The Curse they were fighting was a doll- [Fia](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4051). The last parting gift Iphania had given to [her father](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4192) before he left to fight. A gift that finally returned to the Princess.

But Immerkind's love for the Princess was so well-known that the others grew worried. Iphania and the Outlander had left together in a tender moment. Bae asked Gonathan how Cecilia fared and was surprised to hear that she was doing fine. Whether that was true or not, Bae was determined to go through with her confession.

[Bae is Ready](#embed:https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4438)

In an attempt to be romantic, Bae would tell her to look at the moon... that's no longer there, but Bae pushed through, finally [handing over the letter](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4542) she put all her hopes and dreams into. Cecilia read it, her voice faltered at the start as she read Bea's confession out loud. Then, flowers for Cecili. But before Cecilia would take it, she would ask Bae a few questions: Was this truly what Bae wanted? Would Bae's mother want her to jump for the closest person?

[Yes, it is you.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4740)

[Rejected.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4764)  

There was no need to mince words or prolong a painful moment: Bae's love was for naught, for Immerkind, though thankful for Bae's feelings, must follow her own heart for the princess. Cecilia will stay in Libestal, and perhaps, one day, she and Bae may meet again and then they can talk. They parted, once friendly companions now sorely strained.

Swiftly, Gonathan was by Bae's side. He witnessed the events and Bae's heartbreak.

[*Gonathan...*](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4887) 

In the throes of despair, Bae would drown herself in the river by the bridge. A twisted foil to the events that transpired before, but instead of Cecilia, it was Bae, and instead of Bae, there was Gonathan.

[You died... For me?](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=4911)

Bae drowned and awoke to see that Gonathan had followed her fate. Touched but still in despair, Bae would repeat and repeat her drowning, Gonathan. Followed. Every. Time. Through the waters, through Mordan Ramsay having the most atrocious timing in this dramatic moment, Gonathan was there.

The pain echoed within Gonathan as he blamed himself. Bae couldn't bear to see Gonathan, the best knight she has ever known, do that to himself. 
Bae knew. They all did. Immerkind's obsessive love was not subtle; in fact, it was rather like throwing a brick into a china shop. There was no need for Gonathan to take such a burden on himself when the truth was always open for all to witness.

[Bae is a mother now](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5144)

Bae had responsibilities now. She had kids that she must provide for, Khaos and The Other One. 

[My Brother.](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5214)

The flowers were always meant for someone Bae cared for, and who cared for her. It matters not anymore, love, to Bae. Her mother was right. Love brought pain and is unworthy of Bae's attention. There are more important matters: Her children, money, and her bro, Gonathan. With a toast to Bae's vow of celibacy under the light of the new moon, they solidified their newly forged Bromance, with a strong, firm handshake.

[AWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOO](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5329)


Now, Bae's troubles past her, it was time to witness the strange party everyone's been invited to. Queen Tam inquired about her well-being, and Bae immediately replied she felt great. Who was Immerkind? Love was unneeded. [A small misunderstanding occurred](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5550) but was immediately resolved. She would live for Brotherhood and her kids, introducing the Hot Pink One to her [abandoned nephew](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5633).

The party soon started... but of course, [drama followed](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5761). Bae watched, entranced, at the drama unfolding before her and followed along. 

[... Who was going to deliver the child?](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5883)

Ignoring *that*, Bae would soon look for the Queen, [finding her in her rather mossy abode](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=5936). After entering properly, Bae had to ask about the situation and learned that no, the Queen shall not be the godparent to the child, and the Queen's love is herself. She also learned that the Queen will be staying in Libestal and revealed that Bae herself would leave to find her box that blasted Charlie left somewhere. 

[The goddess](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=6239) would ask Bae where the Queen was, but Bae, on the promise of brotherhood, refused to say and would follow the group along. Eventually, the Hot Pink One gave birth. It's a gassy girl! [The less said, the better](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=6744). The baby is named Gasol-Ina and would immediately be thrown into a family drama that ended in a duel where her Brother would defend the Queen, and a dissection would occur on the Hot Pink One's abdomen.

But romance was not dead, for Bae would witness [a wonderful wedding](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=7715) between Kiara and Roa. After they took one last portrait for the questionable day, Bae would leave to fulfill her promise to her kids. A room. Oh, and [Gacha](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=8062).

[After many attempts, 36 attempts today, Bae finally obtained 2 Stain figures from the gacha box](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=8199)

Finally, Bae went to finalize the room for her children, Khaos and The Other One. Before long, it was done. Warm and comfortable, a bed for each with plenty of food supplied while Bae goes on her journey.

[Kids' Room](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=9402)

[And The Other One is named... Chaoz](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=9475)

Bijou called, and Bae was quick to invite her to see her child's room. Some music was also added too, a little entertainment for the children. Their Uncle Gonathan, too, came by to commemorate the moment.

But alas, with every high in life, there are lows, for [Bae was scammed](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=10289), and her endeavours in [fireworks did not spark colour in her life](https://youtu.be/Br6dvhVJ_IE?t=11047).

Perhaps the morrow would be a more joyous occasion for the Peasant The Bae.
