The Princess had a doll—a small, precious thing she once gave to her father before he rode off to war. It had kept her safe, she believed, and she hoped it would protect him too. But he never came back. Nor did her mother. Nor did countless others.

The doll bore a striking resemblance to Fia.

Fia, who had always placed unwavering faith in the Shining Stars—the heroes meant to save the world, and beyond it, the universe. So when the battle was won and all that followed was a simple “thank you,” it felt... hollow. Incomplete. As if something vital had been left unsaid.

Was it the end? Was it truly over?

All that remained was silence—no cheers, no farewells, just the lingering haze of uncertainty.

Perhaps the final day would reveal the truth. Perhaps the story wasn’t over yet.
