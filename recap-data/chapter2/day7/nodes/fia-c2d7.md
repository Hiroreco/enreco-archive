The Princess had a doll—a small, precious thing she once gave to her father before he rode off to war. It had kept her safe, she believed, and she hoped it would protect him too. But he never came back. Nor did her mother. Nor did countless others.

The doll bore a striking resemblance to Fia.

Fia, who had always placed unwavering faith in the Shining Stars—the heroes destined to save not just the world, but the universe beyond. And when the final battle was won, joy rippled through the kingdom that had long drowned in despair. It was joyful. Everyone was happy.

But was it truly the end? Was it truly over?
