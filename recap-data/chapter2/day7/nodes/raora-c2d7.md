The previous day didn't end as Roa wanted, but it wouldn't matter since _today_ would be the day romance shall bloom and a wedding shall be hers. [Her precious ring](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=380) was ready, and as she planned—

A phone call from Elizabeth. (See [Roa-Elizabeth: Love Unlasting](#edge:raora-liz))

Distracted and flustered, Roa answered. She reassured Elizabeth that she was fine when the Red Knight inquired about her health. There seemed to be something going around, since Mococo was feeling unwell. After hearing Elizabeth's concerns for Mococo, [Roa quickly walked back](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=447) and mentioned that she too felt dizzy and sick from yesterday's accursed event. Elizabeth, too caring and trusting, immediately believed Roa and promised to help.

However, fate was cruel—Roa saw Elizabeth with [Nerissa](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=781); they even shared a room. [Nerissa's rather catty comeback](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=823) pushed her over the edge, and despite Elizabeth’s comfort, Roa fled, calling Nerissa a witch.

But the determination, the delusion, was too strong, as Roa refused to give up on Elizabeth. Anger still coursed through her as she left for the Remnant fields to once again fight the Stains. Another session to destress. Only for it to come back when Nerissa was nearby. Luckily, so was [Mordan Ramsay, who offered free therapy](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=1407) to help Roa calm down.

[Oh, it's so cute!](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=1786)

Perhaps therapy was the way to go. Roa's mood was better as she marveled at the pretty decorations for the party tonight. Floating lanterns filled the sky as "plates" were already placed on the picnic blanket. Roa called Shiori to inquire what time the party would start, easily agreeing to help with the decorations after Shiori answered.

Despite her pursuit of love, Roa was still the CEO of The Gacharms and managed her shop for a while. Their time in Libestal was coming to a close, but there was one more dungeon to face. 

With her new pickaxe, Roa met Elizabeth outside the kingdom and warned her to beware of “[the witch](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2753)” Nerissa. Elizabeth, unfazed, reminded Roa she was a strong knight—and said the real witch was Shiori. [Roa disagreed.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2902)

They debated Shiori’s story and Nerissa’s past but couldn’t see eye to eye—Roa too jealous, Elizabeth too trusting. The topic faded, and [the mood shifted.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=3227)

Flustered, Roa left. She focused on picking flowers to use for the venue's decoration and soon returned when she had gathered enough. Back in Libestal, she saw Mococo, who, unfortunately, was still sick. Concerned, Roa gave her employee a bed to rest in and food to eat, wishing that she would get better soon.

In her shop, Roa encountered a few intruders lurking beneath the floorboards. It was just Gonathan and Nerissa. Roa followed them back to Gonathan's home, and for a moment, the two love rivals [had returned to being friends](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=4784)... until Lady Bloodflame's name was mentioned and Roa left.

[Stick of Love. How Romantic.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=6482.)

And it seemed like others may have news of their own. [One beloved employee, for instance,](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=7981) Bijou, mentioned that she and Shiori might be expecting a surprise! Though the possibility of gas lingered, Roa congratulated Bijou and wished her and Shiori the best.

Soon. The Final Battle was Here.

An Advent of betrayal occurred as Shiori, Bijou, the two unrelated demon dogs, and Nerissa were cursed. Friends (and Nerissa) [attacked them,](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=8643) and it was only after Roa and the others defeated the Stains in the next stage that the curse slowly receded. Before long, those possessed were purified.

A single challenge now remained: The Curse. A battle hard fought as Roa dodged the thorns that grew from the ground and the flowers that sprouted out of nowhere. Eventually, they [overcame it.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=9248)

They did it.

After seven long days, the adventures and battles were finally over. The Princess even found the doll she gave her deceased father—a doll that looked remarkably like Fia.

Roa had one last battle to face—her heart. Though she shared sweet moments with Kiara, it was still Elizabeth she longed for. With Shiori’s encouragement, Roa nervously approached the Red Knight. Elizabeth, however, warned her to be cautious of Shiori. Roa didn’t understand the distrust but agreed to respect her wishes.

She later saw Elizabeth and Nerissa on a date in the onsen. Her delusion shattered. Maybe she never had a chance. In heartbreak, Roa turned to the first friend who came to mind—Shiori. (See [Roa-Shiori: A Witch's Cat](#edge:raora-shiori))

Though saddened, there was still a party to attend. The party that saw a new, gassy one born but [quickly lost.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12121)

Amid drama between The Queen and the goddess, Kiara and Roa left to steal a moment away for themselves, heading towards the Great Hall.

It was a whirlwind romance. A serendipitous realization that ultimately ended in an exchange of rings and... [a Wedding](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12940). (See [Shakira-Roa: The Cat and The Cat Woman](#edge:raora-kiara))

As they celebrated this wonderful occasion, Roa would pull Shiori and Bijou away to talk. Her new wife aside, both had helped Roa tremendously during her stay in Libestal. Roa shared [her determination](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=13224) to find her happiness with her own hands.

She talked of love lost and love found in her diary.
