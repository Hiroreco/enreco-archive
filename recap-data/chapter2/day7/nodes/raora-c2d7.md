The previous day didn't end as Roa wanted, but it wouldn't matter since _today_ would be the day romance shall bloom and a wedding shall be hers. [Her precious ring](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=380) was ready, and as she planned—

A phone call from Elizabeth.

Distracted and flustered, Roa answered. She reassured Elizabeth that she was fine when the Red Knight inquired about her health. There seemed to be something going around, since Mococo was feeling unwell. After hearing Elizabeth's concerns for Mococo, [Roa quickly walked back](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=447) and mentioned that she too felt dizzy and sick from yesterday's accursed event. Elizabeth, too caring and trusting, immediately believed Roa and promised to help.

[Roa's Blind, Delusional Love.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=509)

The gods seemed to be playing tricks, as Roa would soon meet Elizabeth outside the library, but also [Nerissa.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=781) It would be an understatement to say that Roa Pandora was _jealous_ of Nerissa. The Raven's pursuit of the Knight was well-known, and Elizabeth seemed to enjoy Nerissa's company too much. When the two mentioned they shared a room, though Elizabeth slept on the floor, it sent Roa spiraling; The bitterness from [Nerissa's rather catty comeback](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=823) also stung. Though Elizabeth tried to comfort her, Roa left, fervently calling Nerissa a witch before she drowned in despair.

But the determination, the delusion, was too strong, as Roa refused to give up on Elizabeth. Anger still coursed through her as she left for the Remnant fields to once again fight the Stains. Another session to destress. Only for it to come back when Nerissa was nearby. Luckily, so was [Mordan Ramsay, who offered free therapy](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=1407) to help Roa calm down.

[Oh, it's so cute!](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=1786)

Perhaps therapy was the way to go. Roa's mood was better as she marveled at the pretty decorations for the party tonight. Floating lanterns filled the sky as "plates" were already placed on the picnic blanket. Roa called Shiori to inquire what time the party would start, easily agreeing to help with the decorations after Shiori answered.

Despite her pursuit of love, Roa was still the CEO of The Gacharms and managed her shop for a while. Their time in Libestal was coming to a close, but there was one more dungeon to face. People still needed better charms in the meantime. As she prepared, Cecilia passed by, and Roa asked if the smith could [upgrade her diamond pickaxe.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2457)

With a much better pickaxe in hand, Roa met Elizabeth outside the kingdom, where she warned Elizabeth to be careful of [the witch.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2753) While Elizabeth didn't quite understand Roa's vitriol against Nerissa, Elizabeth reassured the pretty kitty that she was a strong knight and that she could keep herself safe. That the real witch to be wary of was Shiori. [Roa disagreed.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=2902)

The conversation would circle as they talked more about Shiori's story and Nerissa's imprisonment. Neither could agree with the other, one too mistrusting of Shiori's truth and the other too jealous to sympathize with Nerissa's past. But the matter was dropped, and [the mood shifted.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=3227)

[A Pretty Flower for a Pretty Kitty.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=3262)

Flustered by the gift, Roa left. She focused on picking flowers to use for the venue's decoration and soon returned when she had gathered enough. Back in Libestal, she saw Mococo, who, unfortunately, was still sick. Concerned, Roa gave her employee a bed to rest in and food to eat, wishing that she would get better soon.

In her shop, Roa encountered a few intruders lurking beneath the floorboards. It was just Gonathan and Nerissa. Roa followed them back to Gonathan's home, and for a moment, the two love rivals [had returned to being friends](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=4784)... until Lady Bloodflame's name was mentioned and Roa left.

[Kiara asked if Roa was into her roommate.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=5697)

Kiara brought Roa back to the forge—the home the phoenix shared with Elizabeth—to show Roa her room. Dozens and dozens of roses filled the frames within, and all of the flowers were gifts from Elizabeth. Despite Kiara's reassurances that there was nothing going on between the roommates—they really were just roommates—[Roa left crying,](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=5845) upset that there was more competition for Elizabeth's love.

But Kiara was quick to follow her, giving [her pets](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=5878) and emphasizing she wasn't Roa's rival. The flowers Kiara received were a sign of **friendship** since she had never received one before. Boldened, Kiara would also ask Roa if the cat knew any single person looking for love since [she and her cousin didn't work out.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=6097)

[A... Confession?](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=6352)

It seemed the cat and the bird had a miscommunication of sorts. They had admired each other since day one, but it seemed like work and adventures had kept them apart. Maybe in another time and world, [things would have been different for them.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=6423)

[Stick of Love. How Romantic.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=6482.)

And it seemed like others may have news of their own. [One beloved employee, for instance,](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=7981) Bijou, mentioned that she and Shiori might be expecting a surprise! Though the possibility of gas lingered, Roa congratulated Bijou and wished her and Shiori the best.

Soon. The Final Battle was Here.

An Advent of betrayal occurred as Shiori, Bijou, the two unrelated demon dogs, and Nerissa were cursed. Friends (and Nerissa) [attacked them,](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=8643) and it was only after Roa and the others defeated the Stains in the next stage that the curse slowly receded. Before long, those possessed were purified.

A single challenge now remained: The Curse. A battle hard fought as Roa dodged the thorns that grew from the ground and the flowers that sprouted out of nowhere. Eventually, they [overcame it.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=9248)

They did it.

After seven long days, the adventures and battles were finally over. The Princess even found the doll she gave her deceased father—a doll that looked remarkably like Fia.

But there was one last battle for Roa to face. Her heart. Though she shared tender moments with Kiara, Elizabeth still held the apple of her eye. After some encouragement from Shiori, Roa would shoot her shot. Nervous, she talked to Elizabeth. The Red Knight noticed Shiori and Roa's conversation and reminded Roa to be wary of Shiori's true nature. Roa didn't understand Elizabeth's distrust of the writer but will nonetheless follow her wishes.

In a rather surprising turn of events, it seemed like Kiara was a forerunner for Roa's heart. Both of them spent more time together throughout the day and even [commissioned a memory and a story from Shiori.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=10472) Roa would cheer for Kiara as the Orange Knight dueled.

[The Moment Roa's Heart Broke.](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=11039)

With unrequited delusional love comes inevitable heartbreak. As Roa witnessed Elizabeth and Nerissa's date in the onsen, Roa knew her chances were gone. Perhaps she never had a chance in the first place. Roa needed a friend, and the first one that came to mind was Shiori. They met underneath Gonathan's tree, and Roa told Shiori of her pain. A love that ended with a whimper that the Red Knight never heard. Shiori comforted her, giving her pats as she reassured the cat that she would find someone much better one day.

Though saddened, there was still a party to attend. The party that saw a new, gassy one born but [quickly lost.](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12121)

Amid drama between The Queen and the goddess, Kiara and Roa left to steal a moment away for themselves, heading towards the Great Hall.

[A Proposal](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12664)

It was a whirlwind romance. A serendipitous realization that ultimately ended in an exchange of rings and...

[A Wedding](#embed:https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=12940)

As they celebrated this wonderful occasion, Roa would pull Shiori and Bijou away to talk. Her new wife aside, both had helped Roa tremendously during her stay in Libestal. Roa shared [her determination](https://youtu.be/m2OG5auudrQ?t=13224) to find her happiness with her own hands.

She talked of love lost and love found in her diary.
