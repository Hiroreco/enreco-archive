Her abdomen hurt—again. Wait, didn’t we already go through this? The whole “I’m pregnant, but it’s just gas” fiasco? Yeah, we did. But apparently, that doesn’t mean it can’t happen again. This time, though, IRyS was _certain_. She believed, truly and deeply, that what she carried was no longer just air—but life. A living soul between her and her eternal consort.

Her ever-supportive brother, of course, had already begun preparing. As any good sibling would.

A gender reveal party, open to the entire kingdom. Everyone was invited to share in the joy, even if half of them [didn’t really know](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=657) _what_ the occasion was. The venue was nothing short of grand—thanks to her brother and Roa. Seats for guests, a ceremonial birthing area (yes, on the spot), and above all, a great sign floating in the sky, ready to unveil the gender of the not-yet-born.

IRyS was excited—not just for herself, but for her beloved, her eternal consort, who had no idea they were expecting. She couldn't wait to see their face.

Still, even with this gas-baby situation looming, she had a world to save. Duty called. She joined the others in the final dungeon, taking on world-ending threats… but her mind stayed locked on [her stomach](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=2354).

Once that small feat—saving the world—was accomplished, it was time for the real event.

IRyS had already picked out [names](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=3581). Gaston, if it were a boy. Gaslonia, if it were a girl. (Tasteful.) At the venue, guests gathered. Some excited. Some confused. Some deeply, deeply concerned. And most notably, her eternal consort stood among them—surely about to be shocked and overjoyed.

Except... someone else was there too.

Tammy.

You know, _the other_ one IRyS had been involved with. And Tammy, invited to a gender reveal for a child between IRyS and _someone else_, was _not_ having it. Her disgust was visible. Her rage, palpable. She even asked IRyS’ brother to [knock some sense](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5189) into her. Fair.

But the show must go on.

Everyone turned to the sign in the sky. It slowly revealed its message. One letter at a time.

[It's a boy, it's a girl, no, it's ~~gay~~](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=5636)

It was a... gas.

Not a girl. Not a boy. Not an attack helicopter.

_A gas_. Well, a _girl gas_, to be specific.

IRyS was elated. Too elated. She went into labor right then and there.

Water broke. On to guests. Ew. Encouragements flew around the room: “Push! Push!” And then—pop. It was over. Except… she never saw the baby. Never held it. News came fast: Mococo had already _killed_ it. Somehow.

IRyS didn’t even question it. She just felt relief, like passing the biggest gas she'd ever had.

And then things spiraled.

Apparently, the child was actually [Tam and Ina’s](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=6901). Apparently, Tam and Ina had feelings for each other. Apparently, IRyS only saw Tam as a sister figure—despite their history. And Ina? Was she cheating on IRyS? No one knew what was real anymore (see [Kronii-IRyS: The Audacity](#edge:irys-kronii) and [Ina-IRyS: Turning To Another](#edge:ina-irys)).

She wrote it all down in her [journal](https://www.youtube.com/live/os9TbwMUcbk?t=11636)—perhaps one of the last. Her account of childbirth. Of fading bonds. And a promise: if her eternal consort was truly turning away, truly seeking Tammy...

IRyS would bring her back.

No matter what it took.
