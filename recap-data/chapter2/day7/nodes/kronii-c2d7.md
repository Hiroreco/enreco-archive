The Queen marches in her own time.

Who said she was late? No, [the Queen is never late](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=137). The world is about to end? It was a simple matter for the benevolent Queen to delay the apocalypse by twenty minutes, for she was also the Warden of Time.

The fight for the future of Libestal began when all the heroes converged, Queen Tam being the last to arrive. Upon entering the final dungeon—the Heart of Ruin—Queen Tam was greeted with a grim curse: [the Curse of Betrayal](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=452). Apparently, some of the heroes had been corrupted, turning against the forces of good, and now had to be purified.

These cursed individuals were Shiori, Nerissa, Bijou, the Fuzzy One, and the Fluffy One, all of whom began to haunt their former comrades. Queen Tam was [haunted by her stepdaughter, Bijou,](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=646) while desperately fighting against the Stains, the voice of her stepdaughter urging her to attack everyone and give in to her darkest desires.

Next came Shiori, far more skilled at exposing Queen Tam’s flaws. The abusive relationships, the vanity, the pet-play allegations—[everything was laid bare](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=750) by the corrupted Archivist, as Queen Tam vehemently denied each imperfection.

After successfully purifying their companions—and surviving all the humiliation in Queen Tam's case—Her Highness and the heroes emerged victorious and proceeded to the final stage. The battle against The Curse began with Queen Tam and the heroes [immediately jumping the enemy](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=990), not even letting it finish its monologue.

The fight was long and brutal. The Curse was unrelenting and vicious with its attacks, and could heal whenever one of the heroes fell, their Revelations could barely keep up. The Queen watched as her own knight Gonathon, tanked a heavy hit and was [brought down to his knees](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=1244).

But there was nothing to fear. Queen Tam and the others [vanquished The Curse](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=1269) for good. It was a battle worthy of legends, destined to be passed down for generations.

After receiving gratitude from the Outlander and Princess Iphania, the benevolent Queen began checking in on her subjects, starting with Immerkind, who was smitten with the Princess and likely distraught over her apparent relationship with the Outlander. The Queen also mingled with the common folk and [discovered a budding romance among them](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=1787).

Now, if this were where Queen Tam's day ended, it would have been perfect. But in true Queen Tam Gandr fashion, trouble was drawn to her like a moth to flame.

One might say there should be a way to forcefully tell the Queen to put down the proverbial shovel and stop digging, but the voices in her head were ignored like passing wind. Immerkind, clearly in distress, failed to perform a proper curtsy. The Queen, taking immediate offense, would later feel awful—classic Queen Tam—upon learning of her emotional state.

After offering comforting words to the green knight about her situation with Peasant the Bae, Queen Tam invited her to attend the Hot Pink One's cursed “gender reveal” party. Why the Queen wanted to attend at all, no one truly knows.

She was greeted with the same bombastic sign—"ITS GAS"—that she had made the day before, now covered for dramatic effect. Naturally, the Queen wasted no time in digging another proverbial hole, unearthing drama like a seasoned groundhog. For reasons unfathomable, Queen Tam implied she was open to a [three-way relationship](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=2732) with HPO and her Consort Eternal, NinoIna (see [Kronii-IRyS: The Audacity](#edge:irys-kronii)).

Queen Tam next found herself attending Shakira and Roa Pandora’s wedding in the Great Hall. The voices in her head noted, yet again, that she never learned. First HPO’s “gender reveal” party, and now the wedding of her previous-timeline lover. Still, she stood in silence, watching one of her “happinesses” marry another.

["Say cheese,"](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5155) she said as she had herself participate in the group photo.

Naturally, the ceremony wasn’t spared from drama. Queen Tam began implying that the “gas baby” was actually hers, which spiraled when NinoIna claimed the child was born [from all three of them](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5204). One could barely keep composure while chronicling these strange Libestan happenings.

This hatched a plan in Queen Tam's mind. Why not just take NinoIna for herself? She hired Mordan Ramsey to be her [wingman](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=5950) and set the plan in motion. Queen Tam and Mordan visited NinoIna, and she [immediately began gaslighting](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=6034) her to think that she does not deserve to be saddled with HPO and her baggage. Finally, the Queen was in her element and seemed to have successfully planted the seeds of doubt.

Not satisfied with her accomplishment, [Queen Tam deemed it necessary to stalk](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=6916) NinoIna's house and saw HPO lurking around. They pretended not to see each other, quite literally, much to Bijou's distress, who was caught in the crossfire between two unrelenting petty forces insulting each other through her.

Before retiring for the day, Queen Tam visited Mordan Ramsey, who was busy preparing the house that she would auction the next day (to which the Queen was humble enough to proclaim she could not afford anyway). It was there that she confided to Mordan and Gonathon more of what she had talked about with HPO. Perhaps in a moment of true sincerity, [Mordan Ramsey gave her the ring](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=8737) she bought and was not able to use, for she was not able to find love in this timeline, hoping that Queen Tam would be able to find some use for it instead.

After writing in her journal and having a quick but [heartfelt reflection with Gonathon](https://youtu.be/CUh9eciJil4?t=9187) on what transpired that day, Queen Tam finally retired for the day.
