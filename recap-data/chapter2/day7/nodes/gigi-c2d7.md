**A New Start for a Weary Heart**

The day started like any other, with Gonathon doing his rounds and visiting companions. But upon arriving at Shiori’s home, the Humble Knight was met with a [sobering discovery](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=482): the witch he had grown close with had no memories of him and greeted Gonathon as a stranger. For most, such a revelation would leave them numb or furious. But the Humble Knight responded only with a gentle greeting and a brief explanation of who he was.

Perhaps deep down, he recalled going through this before and had grown used to it. Or maybe he accepted Shiori’s choice as justified. Whatever the reason, after a short conversation with Bijou and Shiori, the melancholic knight learned Mordan Ramsey had mistakenly purchased the book and hurried off to find her.

Thankfully, the absent-minded therapist quickly realized her mistake and left the book for Gonathon at the knight’s treehouse. Cradling it in his hands, Gonathon [read it](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=1555) and learned that Shiori had hidden several important items for him being the treehouse. Swiftly collecting them, Gonathon had no time to read their contents as Shiori—now calling him “G”—contacted him for assistance in the newest resource area, a request he was happy to oblige.

Meeting the amnesiac archiver (see [Gonathon-Shiori: The Moon Sets So the Sun May Rise](#edge:gigi-shiori)), the two shared a [tender scene](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=2130) in which Gonathon reminded Shiori of their time together, and Shiori talked about Gonathon’s true self, “G.” Watching the sun rise together, they promised to meet again and parted ways. Matters of the heart would have to wait; the Heart of Ruin had to fall!

Gathering with the other adventurers, Gonathon briefly spoke with Peasant the Bae about her plan to propose to Immerkind. As more friends arrived, Gonathon received many powerful items for the upcoming quest, each one a symbol of the relationships he had forged. With the tardy Tam Gandr finally appearing, the fellowship of smiths, cooks, suppliers, and jewelers descended into [the darkest of dungeons](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=4912). Through hard-fought battles, Gonathon helped purify his friends and ultimately slay the malignant Curse, seemingly saving the kingdom.

Returning triumphantly, he faced his next quest: assisting Bae (see [Bae-Gonathon: A Bromance of Eternity Borne Under the Light of the New Moon](#edge:bae-gigi)). Directing Immerkind to the fated bridge, Gonathon listened as Immerkind swiftly rejected Bae, leaving the brokenhearted peasant still clutching the flowers meant for the princess-obsessed doll. Realizing Bae intended to drown herself, the mortified Gonathon [leaped into action](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=6605), succumbing to the murky depths with her several times as he pleaded for her to reconsider. Finally seeing the light, Bae swore an oath of brotherhood with Gonathon, solidifying another bond the knight had built.

Back at the party site, Gonathon witnessed the voracious Hot Pink One demanding Tam Gandr be the godparent of her expected spawnling (see [Gonathon-Irys: Even God's Can Bleed](#edge:irys-gigi)). Tam refused, and the queen and Gonathon retreated to Mordan Ramsey's home to seek counsel (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Immortal Game](#edge:kronii-gigi)). After receiving wisdom from Mordan—including to simply slay HPO—the queen and her retainer returned to the raucous celebration.

There, the diabolical deity again slung insults at Tam, dredging up memories of the queen's time as HPO's maid. Unable to stand by, Gonathon challenged HPO to a duel. If HPO won, Tam would be forced to be her child’s godparent, but if Gonathon won, the degenerate nephilim would stop tormenting the queen. In [a stunning display](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9283), he quickly cut down HPO. After some much-deserved praise from Tam, he departed to speak with Immerkind.

In a [heartfelt, bittersweet scene](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9825), Immerkind laid out her plans to stay behind. Although Gonathon reiterated his desire not to leave his most treasured friend, he understood her decision. They promised to meet again and, after one last hearty awooo, parted ways.

Once again alone, the Humble Knight finally read the notes Shiori had left. In them, she thanked Gonathon for their time together and urged him to make choices for himself, rather than follow others blindly. She finished by reaffirming that, despite all the tragedy between them, Gonathon was still a [good person deep down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=11436s). Gonathon reflected on all his experiences in the past Libestal and concluded it would be best if he, too, went on a [journey of reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=10505s).

But his trials were not yet over. He received a call from Shiori, who revealed she had found the diaries of her past self, laying bare the trauma they had endured in their brief relationship.

Gonathon steeled himself and, rather than flee or make excuses, charged in to confront Shiori. He explained his side and [lamented the way he had treated her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=11316s). Having seemingly righted past wrongs, the knight thanked her, and as the two parted, Shiori gave a seemingly innocent farewell: "See you tomorrow."

With the day’s adventures behind him, Gonathon tied up loose ends. He visited Bae, who was decorating her house for her children, and Tam Gandr, who was hatching [a new plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=13105s) to get back at HPO. Seeing his friends full of vigor and determination, Gonathon reflected on his own trials and vowed to keep moving forward.

After writing his journal, the Humble Knight turned in for the night. One final day remained—and with the Curse destroyed, it would hopefully be one of celebration and rest.
