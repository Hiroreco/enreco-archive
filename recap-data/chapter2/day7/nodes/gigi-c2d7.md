**A New Start for a Weary Heart**

The day started like any other, with Gonathon doing the rounds and visiting his companions. However, upon arriving at Shiori’s home, the humble knight was met with a [sobering discovery](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=482): the witch he had grown close with now had no memories of him, and greeted Gonathon as a stranger. For most others, such a revelation would leave them numb or furious. But the humble knight responded only with a gentle greeting, along with a brief explanation of who he was.

Perhaps somewhere deep in his mind, he recalled going through this situation before, and was used to it. Or maybe he accepted Shiori’s choice as justified. Whatever the reason, after a brief conversation with Bijou and Shiori, the melancholic knight learned that Mordan Ramsey had mistakenly purchased the book and hurried off to find her.

Thankfully, the absent-minded therapist had quickly realized her mistake and left the book for Gonathon at the knight’s treehouse. Cradling the book in his hands, Gonathon [read it](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=1555) and learned of the items Shiori had hidden for him at the back of her tree. Swiftly collecting them, Gonathon had no time to read them as Shiori—now calling Gonathon “G”—contacted him for assistance in the newest resource area, a request Gonathon was happy to oblige.

Meeting up with the amnesiac archiver (see [Gonathon-Shiori: The Moon Sets So the Sun May Rise](#edge:gigi-shiori)), the two shared a [tender scene](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=2130) in which Gonathon reminded Shiori of their experiences together and Shiori talked about Gonathon’s true self, the one known as “G.” Watching the sun rise together, the two promised to meet again and parted ways. For matters of the heart would have to wait; the Heart of Ruin had to fall!

Gathering with the other adventurers, Gonathon briefly talked with Peasant the Bae about her plan to propose to Immerkind. As more and more of his friends arrived, Gonathon was gifted many powerful items for the upcoming quest, each one a symbol of the relationships the humble knight had forged in the past week. With the tardy Tam Gandr finally making an appearance, the fellowship of smiths, cooks, suppliers, and charm makers descended together into [the darkest of dungeons](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=4912). Through many hard-fought battles there, Gonathon helped to purify his friends and ultimately slay the malignant Curse, seemingly saving the kingdom as well.

Returning triumphantly, Gonathon now faced his next quest: assisting Bae (see [Bae-Gonathon: A Bromance of Eternity Borne Under the Light of the New Moon](#edge:bae-gigi)). Directing Immerkind to the fated bridge, Gonathon listened in as Immerkind swiftly rejected Bae, leaving the brokenhearted peasant still clutching the flowers meant for the princess-obsessed doll. Upon realizing Bae intended to drown herself, the mortified Gonathon [leaped into action](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=6605), succumbing to the murky depths of the ocean with the peasant several times as he pleaded with her to reconsider. Finally seeing the light, Bae swore an oath of brotherhood with Gonathon, solidifying another stalwart bond the knight had built.

Returning to the party site, Gonathon witnessed the voracious Hot Pink One demanding that Tam Gandr be the godparent of her expected spawnling (see [Gonathon-Irys: Even God's Can Bleed](#edge:irys-gigi)). Tam flatly refused, and the queen and Gonathon retreated to Mordan Ramsey's home to seek counsel and plan their next move (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Immortal Game](#edge:kronii-gigi)). After getting some words of wisdom from Mordan, including to simply slay HPO, the queen and her retainer returned to the raucous celebration.

There, the diabolical deity once again slung insults at Tam, including dredging up memories of the queen's time as HPO's maid. Unable to stand by any longer, Gonathon challenged HPO to a duel. If HPO won, Tam would be forced to be her child's godparent, but if Gonathon won, the degenerate nephilim would cease her torment of the queen. In [a stunning display](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9283), Gonathon quickly cut down HPO, and following some much-deserved praise from Tam, departed to speak with Immerkind.

In a [heartfelt, bittersweet scene](https://youtu.be/rDdbFYqcAyI?t=9825), Immerkind laid out her plans to remain behind. Although Gonathon reiterated his desire not to leave behind his most treasured friend, he understood Immerkind's decision. The two shared a promise to meet each other again in the future, and after one last hearty awooo, went their separate ways.

Once again alone, the humble knight finally read through the notes left by Shiori. In them, Shiori thanked Gonathon for their time together and implored Gonathon to take to heart her words on making choices for himself, rather than blindly following others. She finished by reiterating that, despite all the tragedy that had happened between the two of them, Gonathon was still a [good person deep down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=11436s). Gonathon reflected on all of his experiences in the past Libestal, and concluded that it would be best if he, too, went on a [journey of reflection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=10505s).

Alas, Gonathon's trials for the day were not yet over, for now he faced possibly his greatest struggle yet. At this moment, he received a call from Shiori in which the archiver revealed she had found the diaries of her past self that laid bare the traumatic experiences the two had endured in their brief relationship.

It was here that Gonathon steeled himself and, rather than flee or make excuses as he had before, the humble knight charged straight in to confront Shiori. He explained to Shiori his side of the story and [lamented the way he had treated her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=11316s). Having seemingly righted the wrongs of the past, Gonathon thanked Shiori, and as the two parted for the day, Shiori gave a seemingly innocent farewell: "See you tomorrow."

With the primary adventures of the day behind him, Gonathon busied himself with tying up loose ends. He visited Bae, who was hard at work on decorating her house for her children, as well as Tam Gandr, who was now hatching [a new plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDdbFYqcAyI&t=13105s) to get back at HPO. Seeing his friends full of vigor and determination, Gonathon reflected on his own trials but vowed to continue moving forward.

After writing his daily journal, the humble knight turned in for the night. All that remained was one final day, and with the Curse destroyed, it would hopefully promise to be one of celebration and relaxation.
