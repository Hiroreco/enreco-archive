**THE WITCH'S LAIR**

More and more people had begun to [discover](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=7063) the secret shrine that had been miraculously constructed beneath Nerissa’s home. Oddly enough, she didn’t seem alarmed. If anything, it felt as though she had wanted them to find it.

As if it were an invitation—
A baptism into the rebirth of something… different.

[**CORRUPTION**](#embed:https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=8881)

All dungeons had been cleared, save for one: the Heart of Ruin. The source of decay. The core of corruption that plagued all of Libestal.

The heroes readied themselves, ensuring their gear and spirits were prepared for the final confrontation. And when the moment came, they descended into the darkness.

Until—

Nerissa realized something was wrong. She had been corrupted.

But she was not alone. Alongside her, Shiori of the Nyavella, the Fuzzy One, the Fluffy One, and Princess Bijou had all been tainted by the Stains.

No one knew how they had been chosen. It was as if the corruption itself had reached out and claimed them. And now, their fate rested in the hands of their comrades—friends who would have to fight to save them... or, if it came to it, be forced to strike them down.

The heroes, however, were just as expected. Tireless and devoted, they fought with all their might—not to destroy—but to purify.

**SOMETHING PERSONAL?**

Fate played its cruelest trick yet. Under the sway of corruption, Nerissa was drawn to [haunt](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9100) Roa Pandora—an encounter that stripped away all pretenses and laid bare what was buried deep in Roa’s heart.

The corrupted witch saw it clearly now: Roa’s quiet affection for Lady Bloodflame... and the jealousy that festered because of it.

> “You stole the Scarlet Knight.”

> “I stole no such thing,” Roa snapped back.

> “You... evil witch! I knew you were evil from the very beginning!”

Roa struggled desperately to hold on to her mind as the raven-haired woman laughed, unrelenting and cruel.

Eventually, the possession broke. Roa was freed.
But only because someone else took her place—[Lady Bloodflame](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9228).

**THE FIRE THAT PURIFIES?**

> “Come to your senses!”\* the knight cried.

> “Come to my senses?\* I believe I came to those a long time ago.”

It didn’t take long for the Scarlet Knight to shatter the corruption’s hold. Was it divine protection that shielded her? Or perhaps the witch, having glimpsed the truth in the Red Maiden’s heart, found herself unable to inflict harm?

Maybe it was simply the blue flames of the knight herself—intense, pure, consuming.

Whatever it was, she ["cleansed"](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9259) Nerissa, pulling her back from the edge.

**THE HEART OF RUIN**

But that was only the beginning. The final dungeon still awaited.

And so, [together](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9412)—heroes and once-corrupted alike—they fought. Blade, spell, and will united. Every wound, every word, every act of faith forged their strength.

In the end, they triumphed. The Curse was vanquished, and Libestal was saved once again.

**SHATTERED MIRROR**

Yet even amidst celebration, Nerissa found no peace.

She had been purified. The corruption was gone... wasn’t it?

And still, her heart felt hollow—a [void](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=14765) where warmth once lived. As if all joy had withered. As if love had died. A creeping chill settled within her soul, and she welcomed it.

> “You see, my heart is still dyed black. I have no intention of ‘saving’ anything.”

This darkness—whether illusion or truth—was now hers to bear. She no longer resisted it.

The monster behind the mirror had broken free.

After all,

> “NOTHING STAYS PURE.”
