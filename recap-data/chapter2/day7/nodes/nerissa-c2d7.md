**THE WITCH'S LAIR**

More and more people had [discovered](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=7063) the secret shrine that was miraculously built under Nerissa's house. Surprisingly, she didn't look bothered; in fact, it rather seemed intentional that she allowed them to find it.

As if it were an invitation to a baptism of a transformed being.

[CORRUPTION](#embed:https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=8881)

So far, all of the dungeons had been conquered but one‚Äì the Heart of Ruin‚Äì the source of ruination, corrupting the whole of Libestal.

The heroes prepared, making sure they were fully equipped to ensure victory.

And when the time was right, they entered the dungeon‚Ä¶ Until‚Ä¶

Nerissa noticed something was different. She had been corrupted! Yet she was not alone, as a few other members-- Shiori of the Nyavella, the Fuzzy One, the Fluffy One, and Princess Bijou-- had been infected by the Stains as well.

How they were chosen was unknown. One thing was clear, however: it was beyond their control, and it was up to their friends to save them‚Ä¶ or, perhaps, take their lives if worse comes to worst.

And as expected of the heroes, they did their best in winning their friends back as they attempted to purify them.

**SOMETHING PERSONAL?**

Fate was such a trickster. Having been possessed, the corruption guided Nerissa to [haunt](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9100) Roa Pandora, enabling her to see through the secrets of her heart. The corrupted ‚Äúwitch‚Äù finally confirmed and confronted her about the woman‚Äôs growing feelings for Lady Bloodflame and the jealousy she harbored for her blossoming relationship with Lady Bloodflame.

_‚ÄúYou stole the Red Knight‚Äù_

_‚ÄúI stole no such thing,‚Äù_ she quipped back.

_"You... evil witch! I knew you were evil from the very beginning"_

Roa Pandora struggled in fighting for her sanity, while the raven one laughed at her demise.

After quite some time, the big cat was finally able to get out of her possession‚Ä¶ Only at the cost of another person‚Äî[Lady Bloodflame](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9228).

**THE FIRE THAT PURIFIES?**

_‚ÄúCome to your senses!‚Äù_ the knight shouted.

_‚ÄúCome to my senses?_ I think I came to those a long ago‚Äù

It did not take long for the valiant knight to overcome the possession. Was it because of divine protection? Perhaps the ‚Äúwitch‚Äù has learned the Red Maiden‚Äôs true feelings by entering her mind and so could not truly hurt her? Maybe it was the blue flames of the scarlet warrior that consumed the corruption?

Before they knew it, the pure knight had ["cleansed"](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9259) Nerissa and won her over to their side again.

**THE HEART OF RUIN**

Yet, such was just the beginning... As the heroes had yet to face the heart of Ruin and bring to an end the evil it had caused.

Entering the [final](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=9412) dungeon, the warriors fought in all their might, side by side, even those that had been corrupted once. Together, with their own skills and the power of their bonds, the Shining Stars had successfully defeated the The Curse, saving the world once more...

**SHATTERED MIRROR**

Despite all the celebrations, Nerissa couldn‚Äôt seem to find the same joy she had from the beginning.

She had already been purified, right? And yet‚Ä¶ her heart still felt empty as a [void](https://youtu.be/FlPFFE5_X3Y?t=14765). As if there was a growing shadow engulfing all the light and happiness within her. As if buried in eternal winter, her soul became numb. Perhaps, devoid of love, even.

_‚ÄúYou see, my heart is still dyed black.‚Äù_

_‚ÄúI have no intention of ‚Äòsaving‚Äô anything.‚Äù_

This looming darkness, wherever its roots came from, she finally embraced as her own. Whether it was just an illusion or the reality, it mattered no longer.

She had accepted this form.

The monster that had been trapped in the mirror has finally broken free.

After all, _NOTHING STAYS PURE_...
