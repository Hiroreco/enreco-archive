#### Main Story

The seventh day—just one day before the end of the world as foretold by the Book of Prophecies—marked the heroes’ final challenge: to destroy the source of the corruption at the **Heart of Ruin** by confronting and defeating the Curse.

Within the Heart of Ruin, the heroes uncovered deeper truths about the corruption—how it had twisted the lives of those it touched, turning victims into threats, forcing them to strike down the very people they once loved. This horror wasn’t just a tale—they lived it firsthand, as some of their own comrades fell to the Curse and turned against them. Fortunately, through determination and unity, the heroes were able to purify and bring them back.

Ultimately, they triumphed. The Curse was vanquished, and with it, the corruption's grip on the world came to an end. Their goal was achieved.

But just as the dust settled, they discovered something unsettling—a doll, identical in appearance to Fia, lying motionless on the ground. What it meant, and why it appeared only after the Curse’s defeat, remained a mystery. Only time would tell what truth it held.
