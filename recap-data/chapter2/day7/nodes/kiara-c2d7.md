_Spill the tea!_

Shakira inquired of Liz and Nerissa what had happened the day before. The knight felt a bit blue after having missed recent events. Nevertheless, this powerful phoenix was keen on catching up. Shakira quickly got in touch with Immerkind, who updated the Lorekeeper on the status of her connection with the princess.

Liz's sugar mommy was in for a surprise. Liz led Shakira into a fragrant room brimming with roses. Of course, _it was all platonic for her._

What did all these roses imply, one might wonder? Love? Marriage? If so, they certainly weren’t pointing toward anything between Shakira and Elizabeth. Instead, they seemed to hint at something far more unexpected—something blossoming between her and a certain other lady. Someone she hadn’t really interacted with much, yet still adored deeply. Why? Because she was a cat, of course.

Regardless, things were looking bright for Shakira. She’d helped Fuwawa with her cozy little café—something the fluffy one was [immensely grateful](https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=vEe1MwWo-G92o61N&t=7708) for. She’d helped [save the world](https://www.youtube.com/live/ngfdLbrpeM4?si=k8ITOhctAgqchF4l&t=9334), just as they were all tasked to do. And this time, she’d been more involved in everyone’s chaotic antics. Compared to her previous journey, this one had gone surprisingly smoothly.

With the fate of the world now settled, it was time for Shakira to seal her own future. Those roses from before? The gassy party? If romance were ever going to bloom for her, it would be now.

She met with Roa—a pink cat—and after a heartfelt exchange, the two tied the knot (see [Shakira-Roa](#edge:raora-kiara)).

Later, she journaled the day’s whirlwind of events, right before the final day arrived.
