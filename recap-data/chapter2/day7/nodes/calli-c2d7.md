**A New (Career) Start**

After a quick trip to the Bahamas (a kingdom outside of Libestal), Mordan Ramsey returned with a rejuvenated mind to start a job… in _real estate?!_

Providing therapy was beginning to be too much for Mordan (see: Mordan day 6). As such, it was time to venture into new things. Perhaps it was the thought of selling houses that could make a profit without the stress of having to deal with the emotions. But for now, the chef had to do her daily, mundane tasks of completing side quests, upgrading her revelation for the upcoming dungeon, and reading inquiry letters she had bought.

And unknowingly, [she accidentally read one of Shiori’s letters addressed to Gonathon!](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=389)

Mordan panicked. Putting it back wasn't an option. She couldn’t openly give it to the Humble Knight either—that’d be awkward.

The pink wolf encountered a disgruntled Roa, who had been upset by how much Nerissa was hovering around Elizabeth while killing Stains. Mordan listened to her and offered a free therapy session to lift the pink cat's spirits. This, _and her dwindling desire to keep chasing her chef dream_, led to Mordan reconsidering whether to continue her therapist career [full-time](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=1927) as _Doctor_ Mordan Ramsey—competing with Mococo's services in terms of quality.

After that, Mordan began working on her real estate business. She sought an empty lot of land and claimed it. As she placed down her first brick, she thought auctioning new housing would market well to the homeless and the constipat- expecting families. Mordan's building process captured the eyes of her wolf pack and a few others who passed by—[even offering tours of the inside.](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=4571)

Bijou later informed Mordan [that Shiori was notified about the letter.](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=4673)

Mordan ran a brisk trip with the rest of her fellow heroes into the _Heart of Ruin_. After they defeated _the Curse_, Mordan returned to build another BIGGER house.

The next big thing to do was to celebrate the Hot Pink One's gender reveal party, as she had been invited by Shiori a few hours ago.

Family drama between HPO, Tam Gandr, and Ina (see: [Ina-IRyS: Turning To Another](#edge:ina-irys) and [Ina-Kronii: Netorare](#edge:kronii-ina)) unfolds in front of the Lorekeeper. It feels so much like a telenovela, the therapist couldn't help but watch the show. [_She even brought out popcorn._](https://www.youtube.com/live/WG748SwXQVo?t=11440)

Being an awkward introvert at the party, Mordan and Nerissa shared a bond over forgoing romance as people gathered around to watch HPO give birth live—_and yes, Mordan filmed it._

Not going to lie, the therapist secretly rooted for this to happen so that she could sell a house to the expecting family. Plus, it was an opportunity to try family counseling services again with the newly formed polycule.

With that out of the way, it was time to get some rest before the big auction tomorrow.
