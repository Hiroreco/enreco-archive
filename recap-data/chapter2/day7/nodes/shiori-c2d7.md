The events of yesterday were hazy in Shiori's mind, a strange feeling for someone such as her. A reboot? That would explain some of the oddness, Shiori was normally keener on the details, as a writer should, of course, but for now there was little left but to go about her day. Her shop for instance had a single sale so far - Mordan Ramsey had bought [something earlier](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=342) earlier, but bemusingly, her items seemed to be untouched.

Shiori called Nerissa, perhaps visiting a familiar face would help Shiori's thoughts settle. Goodies packed, Shiori arrived by the Raven's humble home. Music led her down a secret shrine wherein Nerissa's portrait decorated the simple room. Ever curious, Shiori would look behind the painting and see a hidden bookshelf from which she borrowed a few books to skim. The music however was too loud for Shiori's taste and the two witches would stay by Shiori's own home for a picnic.

[In My Heart I Have Given Up.](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1065)

As they talked, Nerissa mentioned how her heart has given up on the Red Knight. Surprised, Shiori agreed with the decision - it was _doomed yuri_ and the healthiest option for Nerissa was to let go lest she falls deeper. Elizabeth's many suitors certainly didn't help matters though it seemed Nerissa's advances were reciprocated, it was all for naught. As they mentioned Roa, in an amazing happenstance, [Shiori's phone rang](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1096). The panther herself, very much unaware, called to confirm the party's timing. 

Soon Nerissa left but not before Shiori could return the borrowed book. Shiori quickly left after her to witness an awkward scene between Nerissa and the very Red Knight they talked about earlier. Mococo fled the scene in an apparent case of theft as Elizabeth attempted to reason her charge's behaviour.

Yesterday events resurfaced, ones about Shiori's wife and the _possible_ implications that... more than just gas may be in their future. As Shiori called Bijou, it seemed that Jewelled one was still ill, worse, it seemed to spread to others as Mococo showed similar symptoms of this mysterious virus. Well, at least a party for constipation was set up! Regardless, in sickness and in health, Shiori would care for Bijou.

[A familiar voice.](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1732)

Outside their home, it seemed her wife was talking to familiar face. One more tender and softer than usual and who wore a distinctive orange jacket underneath the Libestan cloak. Once upon a time, Shiori knew her under a different name. "His" name was Gonathon G. Calmer. Relaxed.

And missing from Shiori's backlog. Shiori had never met him before. A fact that was unreciprocated, as Gonathon recalled speaking to Shiori yesterday, about an item Shiori had supposedly left for her to buy. Bijou herself seemed to be aware of something by how she, nudged Gonathon away to talk, a conversation Shiori was careful to avoid eavesdropping. When the two finished, [Shiori gave the Knight a small snack for later](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=2040), a small commemoration of their "first" meeting.

The mystery of the stolen book was quickly solved as Mordan soon came by as Shiori noted that the chef bought something earlier, [mistaking it her commission](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=2438). The embarrassed chef learned more about the bookkeeping mechanics and shared that she did deliver the book to Gonathan's home when she realised her mistake. Mordan was at least quite satisfied with her commission when she discovered it had already been delivered yesterday.

Not to waste a day, and to understand the puzzle, Shiori would call Gonathan to join her in some quests. After ensuring that Bijou would be cared for while she was away, Shiori left for the Remnant fields. There was a certain familiarity to the Knight, the way they talked and the easeness her camaraderie.

[Oh, thank you! That's very kind of you, Gigi](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=3283)

But something about her, about yesterday, kept Shiori from using "his" name. Gonathan was confused, of course she was. She wasn't privy to the memories Shiori had. The only memories she could recall were the times in Libestal and nothing beyond the story they're trapped in. Despite this they fell into conversation easily. Too easily. 

[Gigi-Shiori](#edge:gigi-shiori)

[A Sweet Moment Under the Stars](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4171)

Deep talks and sillier moments, there were more memories for Shiori to add to her archive. A strange feeling lingered inside her.  

[**_Ruined_**](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6148)

In the last dungeon, A voice called out to Shiori. 

"_Don't let anyone leave alive_."

A call that that Bijou, the demon dogs, and Nerissa answered as they glowed with an eerie light and flew. Mad, sinister laughs echoed throughout the dungeon's library as the possessed attacked their friends with ruinous magic... Shiori felt fine, taking a moment to observe everyone's panic while picking a book to add to her collection. Still, Shiori did have to eventually join in on the fun, [cursing one in particular with a vicious memory](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6446) before they were eventually saved and the darkness seemingly purified.

Finally, The Curse.

[And attractive](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6687), but unfortunately, betrayal was limited only to the heroes that played the game, and soon Shiori was fighting against the boss, following the narrative written for the story. Thorns erupted from the ground as flowers bloomed, but before long, victory was attained, [but at a cost](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6977). Albeit a temporary one, as Roa was soon back. And so was the Outlander and Iphania, the duo appearing to thank everyone for their heroic deeds. Libsetal wasa saved, and a familiar grey doll. Fia. The doll gifted to the deceased King had finally found her way back to the Princess's arms.

One important invent was left: The ~~Constipation~~ Party. All was well; [Fuwawa's catering](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7271) was superb, delicious food lined each framed plate, the Roa's field of flowers brought life to the venue, and Bijou's lanterns brought light into the sky. To Shiori's relief, Bijou was also well - the gas, not a child, and curse had dissipated. A certain hero finally learned of [expecting news](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7930) as well. Soon, the party, and the birthing bed (yes, a birthing bed.), was ready.

*Baby included*. [The Hot Pink One was in labor](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8883). In a questionable display of entertainment, IRyS gave birth, buckets of water washing across the previously wonderful picnic venue, to the disgust of those around her. Sadly, or not, the ~~chick~~ baby [was gone too soon](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=9845) by the Fuzzy One's claws as fire was burned the picnic blanket while a fight broke out between the guests. Finally having had enough, [Shiori stepped away](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10172) to start the last diary entry. As she entered the Library, Shiori saw a distressed Ina. The goddess's infidelity had finally come to light to the point that the hero questioned the not-so-dearly departed child was hers. Shiori could only offer her sympathies to Ina, witnessing the Hot Pink One's questionable actions beforehand.

But not to worry for there is a joyous occassion to be had -- a wedding! Between Roa and Kiara.

Thoughout the day, [Shiori had supported Roa's](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7135) *purr*suit of the Red Knight. Unfortunately, it was love lost to Elizabeth's impressive level of density (See: [Roa-Elizabeth](#edge:raora-liz)). In the end, Roa could only admit defeat, that another raven-haired lady was the apple of Elizabeth's eye. But, from the ashes of sprout [forth another love: Kiara](#edge:raora-kiara). 

Shiori would walk the beautiful businesswoman down the aisle as crowd cheered for the new couple's happiness. Though Shiori worried for a moment that this may have been a ploy to steal Elizabeth's attention, as the knight was the best woman to Kiara's groom, Roa assured her that this is true happiness, something that Roa would reaffirm later as she declared to [fight for herself](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10949). Shiori congratulated Roa, promising to complete [the commissions](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8350) soon and send them their way.

[Group Photo! Huzzah!](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10859)

Perhaps swept up by the flow, Shiori shared her feelings with Bijou. Insecure since their relationship was unbalanced by what Shiori remembered and what Bijou couldn't. But that didn't matter, not to Bijou. She promised Shiori that she would be the only one Bijou would love. Taking heart the lessons from the past, they would take it slow, and when the time comes to talk they shall. Shiori accepted.

[Ring of Promise](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11132)

The ring now decorates their door as a precious blue flower guards [their home, GothRock](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11372). A cheeky kiss from Bijou had Shiori chuckling fondly as her wife scamps about, bringing her brother with her soon after as Nerissa visited. The two witches then swiftly decided to have Bijou join as a witch-in-training.

It was a day filled with many, many events to write down. As Shiori submitted her diary for the day, something catches her eye:

[**_Betrayal_**](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11957)

An entry written by her own hand, filled with pain. It detailed the Knight's anger, Shiori's sorrows, and ultimately the decision to move on from their relationship. There was more to this, Shiori needed Gonathan's side to... to this event. They met in the Library, where Shiori read her entry to Gonathonâ€”[Though they couldn't seem to find a private place to talk](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=12352).

Gonathan confirmed that not everything written was true; she might have been furious but she could never lay a hand on Shiori. Never. Shiori learned more about their relationship. Of their hastiness and then Gonathan's hesitance to continue this romance. But Gonathan affirmed that the kindess Shiori showed her, *him*, was always there -- everyday. Though her memories were gone, [something lingered in Shiori's heart whenever she met Gonathon](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=12655). A bittersweet feeling that left tears in its wake.
