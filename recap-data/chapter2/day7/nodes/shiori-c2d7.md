The events of yesterday were hazy in Shiori's mind, a strange feeling for someone such as her. A reboot? That would explain some of the oddness. Shiori was normally keener on the details, as a writer should. For now there was little left but to go about her day. Her shop, for instance, had a single sale so far—Mordan Ramsey had bought [something earlier](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=342), but, bemusingly, her items seemed to be untouched.

When Shiori went to Nerissa's house, she discovered a hidden shrine and took several books off a secret shelf. Shiori was annoyed by the loud music, so they chose to have a picnic at her house instead (see [Nerissa-Shiori](#edge:nerissa-shiori)).

As they conversed, Nerissa disclosed that she had lost hope in the Red Knight, and Shiori concurred that it was best that way. As they talked about Roa, [Shiori's phone coincidentally rang](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1096), and the panther confirmed the time of the party. After returning the book, Shiori saw Nerissa and the Red Knight have an uneasy encounter, while Mococo ran away following what appeared to be theft.

Yesterday's events resurfaced, ones about Shiori's wife and the _possible_ implications that... more than just gas may be in their future. As Shiori called Bijou, it seemed that Jeweled One was still ill; worse, it seemed to spread to others as Mococo showed similar symptoms of this mysterious virus. Well, at least a party for constipation was set up! Regardless, in sickness and in health, Shiori would care for Bijou.

[A familiar voice.](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1732)

Outside their home, it seemed her wife was talking to a familiar face. One who wore a distinctive orange jacket underneath the Libestan cloak but missing her trademark gremlin-like demeanour. Once upon a time, Shiori knew her under a different name. "His" name was Gonathon G. Calmer. Relaxed.

And missing from Shiori's backlog. Shiori had never met "him" before. A fact that was unreciprocated, as Gonathon recalled speaking to Shiori yesterday about an item Shiori had supposedly left for her to buy. Bijou herself seemed to be aware of something by how she nudged Gonathon away to talk, a conversation Shiori was careful to avoid eavesdropping on. When the two finished, [Shiori gave the Knight a small snack for later](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=2040), a small commemoration of their "first" meeting.

The mystery of the stolen book was quickly solved as Mordan soon came by, as Shiori noted that the chef bought something earlier, [mistaking it for her commission](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=2438). The embarrassed chef learned more about the bookkeeping mechanics and shared that she did deliver the book to Gonathon's home when she realized her mistake. Mordan was at least quite satisfied with her commission when she discovered it had already been delivered yesterday.

Not to waste a day and to understand the puzzle, Shiori would call Gonathon to join her in some quests. After ensuring that Bijou would be cared for while she was away, Shiori left for the Remnant fields. There was a certain familiarity to the Knight, the way they talked, and the ease of their camaraderie.

[That's very kind of you, Gigi](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=3283)

But something about her, about yesterday, kept Shiori from using "his" name. Gonathon was confused, of course she was. She wasn't privy to the memories Shiori had. The only memories she could recall were the times in Libestal and nothing beyond the story they were trapped in. Despite this, they fell into conversation easily. Too easily.

[A Sweet Moment Under the Stars](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4171)

Deep talks and sillier moments—there were more memories for Shiori to add to her archive. A strange feeling lingered inside her.

[**_Ruined_**](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6148)

In the last dungeon, a voice called out to Shiori.

"_Don't let anyone leave alive_."

A call that Bijou, the demon dogs, and Nerissa answered as they glowed with an eerie light and flew. Mad, sinister laughs echoed throughout the dungeon's library as the possessed attacked their friends with ruinous magic... Shiori felt fine, taking a moment to observe everyone's panic while adding a book to her collection. Still, Shiori did have to join in on the fun, [cursing one in particular with a vicious memory](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6446) before they were eventually saved and the darkness seemingly purified.

Finally, The Curse.

[An attractive one](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6687), but unfortunately, betrayal was limited only to the heroes who played the game. The narrative dictates that this boss must be beaten. Which was soon attained [but at a temporary cost](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6977). Soon the Outlander and Iphania appeared to thank everyone for their heroic deeds. Libsetal was saved, and a familiar grey doll. Fia. The doll gifted to the deceased King had finally found her way back to the Princess's arms.

One important event was left: The ~~Constipation~~ Party. All was well; [Fuwawa's catering](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7271) was superb, delicious food lined each framed plate, the Roa's field of flowers brought life to the venue, and Bijou's lanterns brought light into the sky. To Shiori's relief, Bijou was also well—the gas, not a child, and the curse had dissipated. A certain hero finally learned of [expecting news](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7930) as well. Soon, the party, and the birthing bed (yes, a birthing bed), were ready.

_Baby included_. [The Hot Pink One was in labor](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8883). In a questionable display of entertainment, IRyS gave birth, buckets of water desecrating the previously wonderful picnic venue, to the attendants' disgust. Sadly, or not, the ~~chick~~ baby [was gone too soon](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=9845) by the Fuzzy One's claws as fire burned the picnic blanket while a fight broke out between the guests. Finally having had enough, [Shiori stepped away](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10172) to start the last diary entry. As she entered the Library, Shiori saw a distressed Ina. The goddess's infidelity had finally come to light, and the hero questioned whether the not-so-dearly departed child was hers. Shiori could only offer her sympathies, witnessing the Hot Pink One's questionable actions beforehand.

But not to worry, for there is a joyous occasion to be had—a wedding! Between Roa and Kiara.

Throughout the day and the previous ones, Shiori had witnessed and supported Roa's *purr*suit of love. It was fraught with [great challenge](#edge:raora-liz) that culminated in Roa's defeat. But, from the ashes sprouts [forth another love: Kiara](#edge:raora-kiara).

Shiori would walk the beautiful businesswoman down the aisle as the crowd cheered for the new couple's happiness. She worried for a moment that this may have been a ploy to steal Elizabeth's attention, as the knight was Kiara's best woman, Roa assured her that this was true happiness, something that Roa would reaffirm later as she declared to [fight for herself](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10949). Shiori congratulated Roa, promising to complete [the commissions](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8350) soon and send them their way.

[Group Photo! Huzzah!](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10859)

Swept up by the flow of events, Shiori shared her feelings with Bijou. Insecure since their relationship was unbalanced by what Shiori remembered and what Bijou couldn't. But that didn't matter, not to Bijou. She promised Shiori that she would be the only one Bijou would love. Taking heart the lessons from the past, they would take it slow, and when the time comes to talk, they shall. Shiori accepted.

[Ring of Promise](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11132)

The ring now decorates their door as a precious blue flower guards [their home, GothRock](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11372). A cheeky kiss from Bijou had Shiori chuckling fondly as her wife scamped about, bringing her brother with her soon after Nerissa's arrival. The two witches then swiftly decided to have Bijou join as a witch-in-training.

It was a day filled with many, many events to write down. As Shiori submitted her diary for the day, something caught her eye:

[**_Betrayal_**](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11957)

An entry written by her own hand, filled with pain. It detailed the Knight's anger, Shiori's sorrows, and ultimately the decision to move on from their relationship. There was more to this; Shiori needed Gonathon's side to... this event. They met in the Library, where Shiori read her entry to Gonathon—[though they couldn't seem to find a private place to talk](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=12352).

Gonathon confirmed that not everything written was true; she might have been furious, but she could never lay a hand on Shiori. Never. Shiori learned more about their relationship. Of their hastiness and then Gonathon's hesitance to continue this romance. But Gonathon affirmed that the kindness Shiori showed her, _him_, was always there—every day. Though her memories were gone, [something lingered in Shiori's heart whenever she met Gonathon](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=12655). A bittersweet feeling that left tears in its wake.
