The events of yesterday were hazy in Shiori's mind, a strange feeling for someone such as her. Normally, she would be keen on the details, as a writer should, of course, but for now she felt... odd. Perhaps it was due to the quietness in the morning, or perhaps it was because today is their penultimate day in Libestal, and tomorrow's outcome depended on today's success.

Nonetheless, there was work to be done. As Shiori checked her shop, she noted that Mordan Ramsey had bought [something earlier](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=342), though, bemusingly, her items seemed to be untouched.

Shiori called Nerissa to talk and offered to bring some food as a courtesy, something simple. On her way to visit, Shiori saw Mordan constructing a few houses for an auction later on. It seemed that while the therapist-chef was still wary of Shiori, Mordan accepted the invitation to the party.

As Shiori neared Nerissa's humble house, music played in the air, leading down underneath a secret shrine, one decorated with Nerissa's portrait. Behind the picture was a collection of books that Nerissa owned. Not one to pass reading, Shiori skimmed them. They were fine.

The music, however, was too loud for Shiori's taste, and she offered to host Nerissa back at the home she shared with Bijou.

As they spoke, Nerissa mentioned that she had [regained her memories](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=892) from the previous chapter, in addition to the one she had commissioned Shiori the day before. Though Nerissa herself isn't sure if it's wholly accurate, she nonetheless trusted Shiori. There was no reason for Shiori to lie, after all.

It was nice to see that someone trusted her and acknowledged the value of her work. Unlike a certain Scarlet Queen. Nerissa guessed it was Elizabeth when Shiori mentioned what had occurred yesterday.

Fortunately, Nerissa understood the nature of painful memories. The difficulty in accepting a painful truth. A witch to a witch, sense of camaraderie between them was (re)born. They spoke more, gossiping about Lady Bloodflame's hypocritical faults that the knight didn't seem to notice.

[In My Heart I Have Given Up.](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1065)

This surprised Shiori, but she approved of Nerissa's decision; it was probably the healthiest option—it was doomed yuri to begin with. There were too many suitors who tried to catch the Red Knight's heart, and while Nerissa's advances seemed to indicate something between the two, oftentimes it was for naught. Roa's name came up in the conversation as [Shiori's phone rang](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1096). It was Roa calling to confirm the timing for the constipation party later. Shiori would also invite Roa to help with the decorations before ending the call.

Likewise, Shiori's talk with Nerissa soon came to an end, and they celebrated a new bond between them, one of Witches, a coven of witches. One, they might invite Shiori's Jeweled One into their fold.

Nerissa left, but soon after, Shiori realized she had forgotten to return her book. She quickly followed her now fellow witch only to witness a rather awkward scene: Nerissa and Elizabeth talking about Mococo stealing from Nerissa. After a quick return of the book, Shiori left.

Reminded about Bijou's health and the _possible_ implications that it may be more than just gas that lingered in the Jeweled One, Shiori called her. Still sick, and it seemed that Mococo caught this accursed virus as well. There might be quite a bug going around the village recently. Well, at least a party for constipation was set up, and whether Bijou would join her brother in unfortunate childbirth or simply be sick, Shiori would take care of her.

As Shiori hung up, she could hear Bijou... and another voice outside.

[A familiar voice](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=1732)

Another person was with Bijou, one who wore a distinctive orange jacket underneath the Libestan cloak. Once upon a time, Shiori knew her under a different name. "His" name was Gonathan G, and unlike before, Gonathan seemed to be a much different person. Calmer. Relaxed.

And missing from Shiori's backlog. No memory of Gonathan remained in her, not from the previous nor the current chapter they're on. A memory unreciprocated, as Gonathan recalled speaking to Shiori yesterday, talking about an item Shiori had supposedly left for her to buy. And Bijou seemed to be aware of something as well, nudging Gonathan away to talk. When the two finished their conversation, a conversation that Shiori was careful not to accidentally overhear, [Shiori gave the Knight a small snack for later](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=2040), a small commemoration of their "first" meeting.

As the Orange Knight left, Shiori noted to Bijou that Mordan had bought something from her shop earlier. A Mordan that quickly found her way back to inquire about some basic bookkeeping mechanics before revealing how she accidentally bought the book meant for Gonathan, [mistaking it for the commission](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=2438) she requested from Shiori. Gonathan's journal was delivered safely to her home, at least.

Satisfied that Mordan enjoyed her commission and after food was prepared for Bijou in case she felt sick, Shiori soon left for the newer Remnant field to finish some quests, asking Gonathan to join her as if it were natural. As if she had asked her about this before. There was a sense... of familiarity about her as Shiori spent time with the Knight.

[Oh, thank you! That's very kind of you, Gigi](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=3283)

Gonathan was confused for a moment by Shiori's slip-up. Of course. She wasn't privy to the memories Shiori had. The only memories she recalled were the times of Libestal and not of before. Noting the [discrepancies](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=3369), Shiori moved the subject along, asking Gonathan about her story. She listened, witnessing a few silly moments the [Knight displayed](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=3745). Another memory to add to her archive.

[A Sweet Moment Under the Stars](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4171)

[Gonathan asked if the memories were painful... would she rather forget those?](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4297)

It seemed the Knight was more aware than she appeared to be. Perhaps, there were painful memories with "Gonathan." Gonathan mentioned they talked many times like this, through the night until the sun rose once more. Shiori then asked if she, Gonathan, remembered her life before Libestal; would she still be the same? Gonathan pondered this for a moment, bringing up Queen Tam and Peasant The Bae, who, though they regained their memories, are still the same. Perhaps for Gonathan, it would be similar—she would just be more complete.

Her thoughtfulness [rendered Shiori speechless](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4563). She couldn't find a word to label this bond between them, but maybe simple companionship was enough, Gonathan suggested. There was no need to rush or name this thing between [them at the moment](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=4726).

The time for their last dungeon was soon. As Shiori prepped for their adventure, ruminating on her time with Gonathan, Shiori felt strange. The Knight was just too different from her former self. But speaking of others being unwell, Bijou and Mococo were still ill. The Hot Pink One, too, but she was most likely a different case.

[**_Ruined_**](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6148)

A voice called out to her. _Don't let anyone leave alive_.

It seemed it called out to Bijou, the demon dogs, and Nerissa too, as they all started to fly, mad laughter bursting forth from their throats, strange ruinous magic at their disposal... Shiori felt fine. She observed, picking up some books to add to her collection, as her once-group of criminals attacked their friends.

Shiori soon joined the ruined ones, casually attacking the heroes to play the role she was assigned. [Cursing one in particular with a vicious memory](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6446). She followed the others as they climbed up the platforms while fighting Stains and avoiding explosive attacks.

Luckily, it seemed that this part of the role was over as the curse subsided. Another library was found, another book to add.

Finally, The Curse.

[That actually looked pretty attractive](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6687), but unfortunately, betrayal was limited only to the heroes that played the game, and soon Shiori was fighting against the boss, following the narrative written for the story. Thorns erupted from the ground as flowers appeared, but before long, victory was attained, [but at a cost](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=6977). Albeit a temporary one, as Roa was soon back.

Exposition was soon upon Shiori as the Outlander and Princess Iphania appeared, thanking everyone as Libestal was finally free from its tragic fate, including a doll, one that looked remarkably like Fia. It was the doll that the previous King brought with him before he perished. A doll that was finally back in the Princess's arms.

Back within the kingdom's walls, [Shiori pulled Roa aside](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7135) to ask her about her plans. Shiori encouraged Roa to pursue Lady Bloodflame today and gifted her some food to win the Red Knight's affection.

But there was a party to check on. Shiori was impressed by [Fuwawa's catering](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7271), showering her with compliments. The decorations were also well done; flowers were also beautifully planted around, accentuating the venue even more. Bijou also seemed to be doing well; the gas, the curse, had dispersed earlier.

In the midst of the preparations, and for some reason, Shiori found herself cooking potato salad again. It seemed she had a taste for it today. Shiori called Gonathan to inform her that she had found a letter of hers and to ask if Gonathan could meet her. They met at Gonathan's tree. [Shiori accidentally eavesdropped on a rather touching conversation](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=7930). She watched the happy couple talk, waiting for them to finish before telling them that preparations for the party were soon to be completed and that a bed was added to accommodate the birth.

Disturbed again, this time by Roa's call. A commission for memories from Roa and Kiara. Fanfiction and memories. Roa's memory would be randomised, and Shiori would speak to Kiara about the story later, a ["spicy"](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8350) one of her and Roa. Shiori reassured them the memories will be delivered to their homes when she is done.

Finally, she met Gonathan near his home, [and both of them shared potato salad](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8542), Gonathan mentioning another memory Shiori couldn't recall. One where Shiori had given him the first potato salad she had made. A memory was told to her instead of the other way around.

The party was ready, the guests were there, and they were ready to start. But some things didn't go according to plan as [the Hot Pink One was in labor](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=8883). In the meantime, Roa called to tell Shiori of her horrible day, and Roa had given up. It seemed that the Raven one was too close to Elizabeth for her to truly have a chance. [Shiori comforted Roa](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=9126). Roa thanked Shiori for her kindness.

[Yay! It's a Gassy Girl!](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=9716) The Hot Pink One had given birth! And the ~~chick~~ baby [was gone too soon](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=9845), by the Fuzzy One's claws. Literally. Fire was burning the picnic blanket as another fight broke out between the guests. Finally having had enough, [Shiori stepped away](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10172) to start the last diary entry.

In the Library, Shiori met Ina, who seemed upset. The Hero didn't know, and didn't care, that her child had tragically passed away just 10 minutes ago. The Hot Pink One's affairs and infidelity had come to light for the Hero to see, something that Shiori vouched for by how rather... affectionate the goddess was to others.

The sombre affair was soon cast aside for Roa and Kiara's wedding! Shiori walked Roa down the aisle as Kiara waited at the end, with Elizabeth as her best maid. Ina officiated their marriage, and it seemed that there would be at least one happy romance in this chapter.

[Group Photo! Huzzah!](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10859)

Roa beckoned Shiori and Bijou closer to [share her determination to find her happiness with her own paws](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=10949) as her new wife, Kiara, watched proudly a few tables away. Shiori congratulated the happy couple once again and promised Kiara that, once completed, the commissions would soon find their way to them. Swept up by the flow, Shiori shared her feelings with Bijou. That their relationship was unbalanced by what Shiori remembered and what Bijou couldn't. It wasn't entirely honest.

[But That Didn't Matter. Bijou presented her with a ring of Promise](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11132)

Bijou promised Shiori that she would be the only one Bijou would love. They will take it slow, and when the time comes to talk, they shall. Shiori accepted.

[Our Home, Gothrock](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11372)

A ring now framed upon their door, the precious blue flower in front of their home. A swift kiss from Bijou before she swiftly fled. A series of tumultuous events, Shiori noted as she finished her diary. Soon, Nerissa visited while Bijou brought her brother, the Hot Pink One, to chat. Bijou excitedly joins Shiori and Nerissa in their coven as a witch-in-training.

[**_Betrayal_**](#embed:https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=11957)

As Shiori submitted her diary for the day, she spied one of her previous entries, one titled "Betrayal." An entry written with pain gained from someone with a noble and pure heart. It detailed the Knight's anger, Shiori's sorrows, and ultimately the decision to move on from their relationship. There may have been more to this story; with that in mind, Shiori called Gonathan to ask. They met in the Library, where Shiori read her entry to Gonathan—[Though they couldn't seem to find a private place to talk](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=12352).

Not everything in Shiori's entry was true; there may have been anger, but Gonathan would never hurt Shiori like that. Shiori learned the truth, Gonatha's truth, of that day and the nature of her and Gonathan's relationship. Of Gonathan's hastiness and then the Knight's hesitancy to continue this romance. Shiori thanked her, and Gonathan continued that Shiori was kind, even yesterday. Though her memories were gone, [something lingered in Shiori whenever she met Gonathan](https://youtu.be/mb91g7vQSnA?t=12655). It was a bittersweet memory, and Shiori left, crying as she did.
