It is the day of the gas reveal, but preparations are still in order. Bijou shares her recent conversation with others, which leads them to believe that perhaps it's just [constipation](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=y5yjkh4NAX9clGIW&t=399), or perhaps a weird virus; only time could tell. Still, she desired to meet her beloved, and Shiori wanted to give her food, so they agreed to meet at the archiver's house.

But upon reaching the archiver's door, she's first met with Gonathon G. Bijou quickly realizes that the archiver has no recollection of the knight. This forces her to intervene and have a private chat with him. Bijou tells him that Shiori was considering temporarily deleting her memories of him, and now she knew that it worked.

Once Bijou notices that her onii-chan woke up, she immediately wants to show her the [preparations](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=ASbpOoYyeE-xFFaZ&t=3584) for the party, and HPO notices that the sign saying "ITS GAS" is too visible, so Bijou takes it upon herself to hide it.

As she's placing the final touches, people are gathering at the wagon to face the Heart of Ruin. In the meantime, Fuwawa report the same stomachache as Bijou and Mococo.

> IT COULD BE GAS, IT COULD BE GAS THO, I CAN'T TELL!

And in the end... It was not gas... Nor a pregnancy but a secret third thing. The Curse. The curse has inflicted Shiori, Fuwawa, Mococo, Nerissa, and Bijou.

Through its powers controlled their minds and forced them to attack and hunt their allies, but with the combined power of the heroes from beyond the stars, they managed to purify them.

With the power of the revelations in one hand and the potato in the other, the heroes manage to defeat the formidable foe and [save Libestal](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=MuH6a3gYsGGU4iHY&t=6043) from the Stain. They quickly meet with Princess Iphania, and there is no betrayal this time; they have done it, they've changed fate. And as they're speaking, they notice a doll next to them, the same doll Iphania has given to her father, and one they were familiar with, Fia.

Immerkind seems to be doing okay, and so is Fia at the Library. This left them puzzled, but without more hints to go by, they decided to wait for the banquet for answers. Now, there was something way more important to them, Bijou's onii-chan's pregnancy/gas reveal party.

The picnic starts innocently enough, there is food, decorations, fireworks, music, and happy guests. The Hot Pink One manages to confess her feelings to NinoIna, her eternal consort, and she feels the same.

As they are all gathered to see the miracle of birth and/or the liberation of gas, Bijou starts to reveal the sign hidden in bricks, and they all can see it says "ITS GAS." Not only is it gas, but, as she also tells everyone, the pink wool behind reveals it's a girl, a gassy girl!

Sadly, things quickly go south. As the baby is taking her first steps, Mococo kills her, and HPO is heartbroken and finds herself in denial. Then, soon after, a fight erupts between Bijou's stepmother, Queen Tam Gandr, and her onii-chan (see [Hot Pink One-Tam](#edge:irys-kronii)).

Bijou finds herself lost in this conflict; she realizes her sister is leaving her onii-chan, and a duel is set between Gonathon and the Hot Pink One, with concerning stakes. If the princess' brother were to lose, someone would have to cut open her stomach. With no one else willing to fulfill this task, Bijou decides to take it upon herself... Maps... Maps... Maps... Maps are the only true...

And so, the duel starts. And while the goddess tries her best, she quickly finds out she's no match for the knight, and it is time for her punishment. Bijou gets close to her onii-chan and starts the excruciating process, she cuts, and cuts, and cuts. Reaping everything out, making sure there is nothing left inside. And at the end of this, she finds inside a single thing... A... Soul...? Alcohol...?

There's little time to think about it, because a wedding was going on at that moment between [Shakira and Roa](https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=pz0kfmf9vTMEW-NB&t=9791) Pandora, huzzah! What a joyous occasion! However, Bijou is a bit confused, as she thought her boss was interested in Lady Bloodflame.

They have a quick talk, and Roa tells the princess that she has decided to seek what was best for her and find someone who had eyes for her. This inspired Bijou.

Shiori seeks her out, she wants to talk about the future. Bijou desires to be with her, but the witch expresses worries of taking advantage of her, as the princess has not yet regained all her memories.

Without time to lose, Bijou runs to buy a ring, a ring not to propose, but to promise her beloved that, no matter what, she only has eyes for her. Bijou doesn't mind being used, as long as they can be together. And Shiori accepts the ring.

[Rock hard again](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/4_zJe0t0558?si=ti6H09S9SrEnuLNp&t=10106)

They teleport to the witch's house, set the ring on display, and rename it to The Home of Gothrock, as they will now live together.

Bijou leaves her home once more to talk with her onii-chan, which led the little princess to stand in the middle of the conflict between her step mother and her brother once more. Tam, deciding she no longer wishes to keep wasting her time arguing, leaves, leaving Bijou and the Hot Pink One alone.

Is it then that her brother is determined to convince Bijou the princess that the queen only desires to use her. However, Bijou is reluctant to believe this.

Without being able to choose a side, Bijou can only run and cry. Why must the people she loves fight? Why must there be conflict everywhere? Bijou did not know, the only thing she knew for sure...

It was maps. Maps maps maps maps maps maps maps maps.
Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaps.
