**Are You Okay?**

Another day, another journal. Elizabeth is worried about keeping _someone_ safe. Yet when she looks at Thorn and strikes at the enemy, it cuts differently now. Flashes of ink splashed across a page seared into her memory. Thoughts of accosting someone without cause, without jury, without... justice.

**_Which home do you want to go back to?_**

Elizabeth's morning is interrupted by ominous music, prompting concern for her sister Mococo and the kitty Roa.

That entices her to pull her phone out and call Roa, asking if she was okay due to how upset she seemed yesterday. It doesn't take much for concern to take over when Roa states she feels ill and her stomach is still upset from being cursed. Swiftly, Elizabeth buys Roa some costly treats.

As the two chat, Nerissa shows up, causing the fur on Roa's tail to stand up. Bloodfumble makes herself known again when Nerissa admits that she [stayed the night](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=854) in Lady Bloodflame's room. Offering the same to Roa with Nerissa in the room only infuriates and frustrates Roa and causes her to run off.

"I wonder why Roa doesn't trust Rissa."

Once again, that damned ominous music returns. Nerissa had said she was fine, Elizabeth mumbled to herself (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Forget or Forgive](#edge:liz-nerissa)). Still, she worries and rushes next door, calling for Nerissa multiple times before breaking down the door.

It's her _duty_ to protect. She needs to know that the Witch is safe!

Inside a trapdoor tucked in the corner draws her eye. Scared of what lies beneath, she descends quickly through tight halls—until she's face-to-face with the truth.

**_A trick._**

"Being played a fool. What a foolish knight I am." Elizabeth whispers.

"She was low the other day and was just playing a trick on me to make me feel better," Elizabeth lies. "I will see the brighter side."

Even so, she worries. _Is Ravencroft okay?_

Roa reappears, her disdain for the Witch clear. Despite the trickery, Elizabeth defends Nerissa, warning Roa that Shiori is the danger. The story given to Nerissa painted Elizabeth as cold, callous—unworthy of a knight.

**_F̵o̵r̸ ̷J̸u̸s̶t̴i̷c̵e̶-̴_**

Shaking her head, Elizabeth returns to the forge. She briefly greets the Mighty Phoenix and reminds herself to gift her flowers. In the basement, she confronts framed memories of the unknown.

She gathers materials and builds a fire. Holding the memories, Elizabeth scoffs and [casts them into the flames](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=5712).

**_O̴̠͋h̶͇͂,̴͙̕ ̵͚͋t̴̠́h̷̄ͅè̴̟ ̵̢̈́m̸̫̄ẽ̵̟m̷̟͒o̷̥̓r̸̜̓i̸͚͝ȅ̷̤s̴̹̅.̵̝͌ ̴͚̾Ĕ̵̥v̷̟̆ě̶̗ṙ̵̪y̷̤̆ȍ̶͎n̸͇̓e̸͙̋ ̵̠̍ẘ̶͜ǎ̴̦n̶͈̉ţ̵̍s̶̱̏ ̶͕̂ẗ̸͈́o̶̤͑ ̶̼̈́b̶͍͝ę̴̐ ̶̥̓m̷̰̍ỵ̶͐ ̶͌͜ȇ̶̯n̴͕͐e̷̮̔ḿ̶͎ỳ̷̳.̵͓̋_**

_I won't let these memories hurt Nerissa. These lies and scams._

Shiori tries to approach Elizabeth more than once, but the strong knight ignores her and walks on past without a word. She has to focus on the dungeon—on saving Libestal.

Stepping into the dungeon with everyone else simultaneously to face the final boss together, they instead face something even more terrifying.

Elizabeth must face her friends. Must face... Nerissa.

Without warning, Elizabeth loses control of her own body. Nerissa giggles sweetly in her ear.

Then suddenly, Nerissa is ejected out of her just as quickly as it happened. The Curse strikes out at them before they even have time to discuss what happens. The group fights valiantly and defeats the creature. To finally defeat this evil that stained the Kingdom of Libestal.

**_D̵o̴ ̶y̵o̷u̴ ̷w̴a̶n̴t̸ ̶t̷o̶ ̸g̴o̴ ̶b̶a̵c̴k̷?̸_**

Once free, she spots Roa with Shiori again and approaches, warning her about the evil Witch. Again, she is questioned about which one is truly the evil one: Shiori or Nerissa?

Yet despite that question, she asks Nerissa if she's okay after the dungeon. Again, she's asking Nerissa if she's OK. Is it the third time today? The fourth?

A stop in the castle has her [staring at the paintings again](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=10221). Shiori. Nerissa. Bijou. Fuwawa. Mococo. Why are their photos together?

**_Ⱨ₳Ɽ฿ł₦₲ɆⱤ Ø₣-_**

Elizabeth prepares fireworks for the party; [Nerissa steps in](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=10432) to visit her and chat.

Elizabeth makes red fireworks for herslef and blue ones for Nerissa.. After a failed test, Nerissa makes a suggestion.

A trip together to the onsen.

Yet again, Roa shows up, and Elizabeth Bloodfumble returns full force. Nerissa walks off as Elizabeth offers to have all three attend the onsen together. Something Nerissa or Roa seems too keen on. Somewhere along the way, she loses Roa and searches for Nerissa, finding the onsen she wasn't aware of.

With the other already in the steamy and hot water, Elizabeth undresses and removes her helmet as she climbs into the opposite side, unaware of wandering eyes inside and outside the onsen.

After a while, the two quickly make their way to the event of the day.

With the... Gas party underway, Elizabeth finds herself at Nerissa's side throughout the entire thing. Even sharing a picnic.

Walking back to the forge after the party, she takes a moment to [stare at the burning memories](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=13731). Once again, she finds herself face-to-face with Nerissa.

["You're also pretty too."](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?si=038e-vGsvZvwxgJe&t=13938)

It comes out vocally this time. It's not a thought inside Elizabeth’s head—an admission of something.

**_A͓͓̽̽r͓͓̽̽e͓̽ ͓̽Y͓͓̽̽o͓͓̽̽u͓̽ ͓̽O͓͓̽̽k͓̽a͓͓̽̽y͓̽?_**

Again, the question spills from her lips. Again, Nerissa says she's fine in that honeyed tone. Smiling, Elizabeth says they will talk on the morrow.

But Kiara brings a warning. [Something to heed](https://www.youtube.com/live/sDjysXFWYbI?t=15003).

Calling Nerissa a witch. Saying she casts curses. Elizabeth wants to believe she's a good witch—but maybe it’s a warning too late.

If a witch is fated to be a witch... Then a witch she shall be.
