<!-- title: Potential Cult -->

IRyS had always known Immerkind was a little strange, but today’s encounter took that strangeness to a whole new level. It started normally enough—friendly greetings, the usual small talk—until, without warning, the green one casually dropped a question: how did IRyS feel about being a goddess? Would she be interested in standing above others?

Before IRyS could even process, let alone answer, Immerkind offered no further context, no clarification. Just that cryptic suggestion—and then she walked away.

It left IRyS more confused than anything. Troubled, even. What was that about? What was Immerkind planning? Whatever it was, it didn’t feel like something to take lightly.
