<!-- title: Sugar Phoenix -->

Elizabeth held a deep respect for Shakira. A mighty phoenix, a radiant and friendly soul, and above all, a fellow knight—she was everything Elizabeth admired. That respect went both ways. Their bond, seemingly carried over from past adventures, remained as strong as ever—perhaps even stronger now.

So when Shakira offered her help to the lone scarlet knight, Elizabeth was beyond delighted.

The way the two interacted—so naturally, so comfortably—could easily make one mistake them for family. Shakira especially played into the role, taking on the mantle of a “mother bird.” She bought everything Elizabeth needed for her quests, from humble items like [butter](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=jlgLHt9iX51FLlEP&t=3358) to pricier ones like [gacha boxes](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=omF41I7UAk3lXAXN&t=4393). She even gave herself the title of Elizabeth’s “sugar mommy”—though in this case, it was as sweet and wholesome as it sounded. The red maiden, ever innocent and a little clueless, reacted to the nickname with the wide-eyed surprise of a child.

With all her tasks finished, Elizabeth asked her “mother” for one last bit of help before calling it a day. Seeing all the other heroes setting up shops to sell their goods, she wanted to try too—but had no idea where to start. She’d begun building a modest store, but a guiding hand would mean the world. Shakira, without a second thought, agreed.

And with her deft craftsmanship, Shakira not only helped Elizabeth set up shop—she transformed it. The store came to life in a way that left Elizabeth speechless, eyes gleaming with admiration.
