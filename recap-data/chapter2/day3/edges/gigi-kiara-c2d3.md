<!-- title: A One-Sided Rivalry, a Two-Sided Contract -->

With Kiara's resolve to become known as the greatest smith in Libestal, it was only natural for her to quickly set her sights on competing with Gonathon. However, any attempts at one-upping Gonathon were quickly shelved. Kiara not only agreed to assist Gonathon, Immerkind, and Mordan Ramsey in their descent into the second dungeon, but also joined their newly formed [Wolf Pack](https://www.youtube.com/live/dgfH4qnRlfw?si=92Qk-dRTvlTvGjZi&t=8293).

Aside from a few further jabs from Kiara that went unnoticed by Gonathon, the adventure proved fruitful, and the Wolf Pack emerged from the dungeon victorious. This was not the end of Kiara's dealings with the Humble Knight, however, as she soon revealed a deep desire: she wished to woo Cecilia Immerkind, despite being cousins!

Despite knowing of Immerkind's borderline obsessive desire to marry the Princess of Libestal, Gonathon agreed to assist the ambitious phoenix, particularly after Kiara promised to set Gonathon up on a blind date with "the one who is perfect for them." This plot would eventually have wide-ranging and devastating consequences. (See [Cecilia-Gonathon: Wolves Before Harlots](#edge:cecilia-gigi))
