<!-- title: Strawberry Red -->

After the absolute disasterclass that was her fumbling mess the day before, the scarlet knight was ready for redemption. Even the voices in her head were rooting for her. The moment she crossed paths with the blue maiden again, encouraging chants echoed through her mind: “Don’t fumble, Milord,” “You got this, Milord.” And she was determined to prove that she did, in fact, got this.

Her strategy was simple: flatter her. Call her beautiful—no, *gorgeous*—praise the majestic feathers by her hips, and even show off a bit of her smithing expertise by crafting an upgrade stone just for her. All while staying calm, cool, and collected.

And it was working… until Nerissa gave her a [rose](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=NRlhYHYNbLkCksuF&t=7618) in return.

That’s when the cracks began to show.

First came the fluster. Then the fidgeting. Heat crawled up her face. In a desperate attempt to wrestle back control of the situation, she called Nerissa a witch—clearly hoping the accusation would distract from the butterflies wreaking havoc in her chest. But it only made things worse. “How so?” Nerissa asked. And thus began Elizabeth’s spiral.

*“Aha! Witch! I have all the reasons to call you a witch!”*—was likely the train of thought. She tried to recall their past adventures, stacking up “proof” of Nerissa’s sorcery. But each memory only made her more flustered. She claimed the blue maiden cast spells on her. *“What spell?”* Nerissa inquired. “You made my face a strawberry.” *“But how?”* “You hushed my gums.” *“What does that mean?”*

It meant Elizabeth was scrambling, that’s what.

Desperate to recover, they settled on a sparring match, as if a couple swings of a wooden sword could knock the embarrassment out of her.

Elizabeth didn’t need to hold back—she was already nerfed. Swinging her blades, raising her shield, trying to stay focused… all while a majestic blue maiden danced around in front of her, fully immersed in their little spar. Every move Nerissa made was deliberate, serious, graceful. And that sight alone? More than enough to break the composure of the scarlet swordwoman.

In the end, Elizabeth still won—she *was* a knight, after all. And surprisingly, the match helped clear her head. The fog lifted. She was calm again.

For about a minute.

Nerissa smiled, leaned in, and kissed her cheek. A soft, simple *mwah*. 

A "reward" for the performance. 

The strawberry glowed so red it might as well have been a beacon.
