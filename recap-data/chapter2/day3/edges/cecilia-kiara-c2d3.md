Apparently Shakira had feelings for her cousin...yeah...yikes. She even went so far as to ask Gonathon to pair her with the green one. In a kingdom where rumors of inbreeding swirled, this revelation was, surprisingly, less shocking than it might have been.

In a quiet corner, they shared a private conversation. Cecilia admitted she cherished the roses Shakira gave her, but her heart was set on Princess Iphania. Yet, with a tender pause, she confessed there might be room in her heart for twoâ€”Shakira and Iphania.
