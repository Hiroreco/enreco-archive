<!-- title: Is This Jealousy? -->

The Pink One, Pinkie Von Pie, was shocked—baffled, even. No, she was _angry_. “Tammy”—that nickname wasn’t just a cute quip; it was _hers_. Hers and Tam’s. A shared secret born from late-night giggles and stolen glances, a nickname she’d racked her brain to invent, a symbol of their unique bond. That name was sacred. And now? Thrown around like a party favor for everyone to use, as if to spit on the private promise they'd once made.

And then—_then_—as if to turn the tables, Pinkie put her lips on another woman, mouth-to-mouth. _Sensually_. Right in front of Tam. Tam couldn’t bear the confrontation and left, vanishing like a ghost with a broken heart.

They found her later—alone, still, and staring out as if the whole world had turned against her. Contemplating if it was all worth it. Thankfully, Gonathon and Nerissa were there. They talked her down, gently, firmly. Told her maybe what she saw wasn’t betrayal at all. Just a “European greeting.” Normal. Harmless. Maybe... maybe there was still hope. Maybe Pinkie hadn’t meant to hurt her.

Pinkie, meanwhile, was stewing. She wasn’t convinced. What if _Tam_ had abandoned their promise first? She had to know for sure. So she devised a plan: down an invisibility potion and spy on the Blue Maiden herself. See what truths could be uncovered. But alas—whether it was the trail of sparkles or her uncanny aura—each attempt failed. Not [once](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=vhQvTDISnORcV2gU&t=8783). Not [twice](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=Bgk3gewMRka2Fkjd&t=9184). _Three_ times. Spotted immediately.

In the end, there was no other choice—they had to face each other. Woman to woman. Eye to eye. Heart-to-heart.

Words flew like daggers. Accusations, deflections, and painful memories. “You broke our promise,” one said. “It was a three-way _feeding_ session,” the other defended. There were tales of kissing cats. Yes—_cats_. The word “hobby” was thrown like a curse. “You were a good hobby,” said Pinkie. Tammy scoffed, wounded, bringing up _Immerkind_ just to provoke some jealousy.

It was messy. Ugly. And then—_a floating cape appeared behind them_, spewing the foulest of language. A ghost? A cursed soul? Whatever it was, it scared them both witless.

They ran. Together.

And somehow, through the shared panic, they found something they’d lost—_understanding_. Maybe it was ridiculous. Maybe it was fate. But when they stopped running, so did the anger. They looked at each other; tears welled, and suddenly it all made sense again.

They forgave. They embraced. And just like that, Pinkie and Tam were whole again.
