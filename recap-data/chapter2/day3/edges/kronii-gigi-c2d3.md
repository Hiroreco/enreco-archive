<!-- title: A Ship Sunken, A Pack Expanded -->

With much of Gonathon's day devoted to completing quests and assisting Cecilia Immerkind (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: Wolves Before Harlots](#edge:cecilia-gigi)), the humble knight found little time to devote to her queen. Instead, it was Gonathon's claims of the Outlander and Princess being siblings that most impacted Tam Gandr.

After briefly being consoled by Gonathon following Tam's [outburst](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=16055) upon learning of Roa and HPO's love affair, Gandr found herself talking to Cecilia Immerkind, who was also enduring romantic hardship. Upon learning from Immerkind that Gonathon had told her of the Outlander and Princess's supposed familial ties, Tam flew into a frenzy and called Gonathon to confront her. However, rather than being born from concern for Immerkind, Tam instead was incensed over the seeming obliteration of her romantic ship of the two Libestal figures. Gonathon was quick to explain her reasoning, and the pacified Tam went on to agree to join the Wolf Pack.
