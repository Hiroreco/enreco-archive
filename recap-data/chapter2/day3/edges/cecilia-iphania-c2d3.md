<!-- title: My Princess... -->
<!-- relationship: Unrequited Love -->

With Gonathon’s steadfast support at her side, Cecilia finally mustered the courage to confess her feelings to the princess. It was a vulnerable moment, filled with trembling hope and unspoken dreams—but the response she received cut deeper than any blade. For in that moment, it became clear: Princess Iphania’s thoughts were consumed by another. The Outlander.

Gonathon, ever the loyal friend, did all he could to anchor her, to soften the blow, to joke, distract, or rationalize—anything to keep her from spiraling. But nothing could dull the ache in Cecilia’s heart. Her confession had been met not with rejection, but with silence. Silence, and a distant gaze meant for someone else.

Tears brimmed and spilled before she even realized they had formed. She turned and fled, seeking solace in the quiet corners of the castle, eventually collapsing into the familiar comfort of the princess’s chambers. A place that once felt sacred now felt cold.

Maybe... maybe the princess hadn’t spoken because she was overwhelmed. Confused. Yes, confuzzled. She’d just reunited with the Outlander after all this time—it made sense, right?

But Cecilia, in her pain, latched onto a singular, destructive conclusion: _if the Outlander was the burden, then removing them would set the princess free._

Her thoughts spiraled, her heartbreak twisting into resolve—but thankfully, Gonathon was still there. He yanked her back from the brink, firm and unwavering. “No,” he said. Not like this.

Still, Cecilia’s heart had not surrendered. She wasn’t ready to give up—her feelings burned too brightly. And even if they hurt, even if they were ignored, she swore they would be heard. One day, her love would reach the princess.

It was only a matter of time.
