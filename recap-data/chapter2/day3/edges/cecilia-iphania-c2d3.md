Cecilia and Jonathan notice that perhaps the princess may be unable to express her true feelings due to potential political repercussions. Immerkind then makes a [most kind resolution](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?t=5430s).

Cecilia concludes the day by writing to the princess and noting that maybe the princess is better off with another.
