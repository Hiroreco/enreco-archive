<!-- title: The Finest PP and Hole Around! -->

Gonathon and Bae the Peasant forged a hearty business relationship, with Gonathon at first [gifting Bae her prized Stain Hat](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=9921) after the destitute peasant lamented her inability to purchase a hat for herself. Unwilling to allow Gonathon to leave empty handed, Bae forged an enchanted pickaxe for Gonathon in exchange for some upgrade stones. 

However, this would not be the end of their dealings, as Gonathon, impressed by the quality of Bae's craft, [took it upon herself to advertise the peasant's store to all who would](https://youtu.be/dgfH4qnRlfw?t=10269) (and even some who would not) listen. From then on, everyone would hear of the finest PP and hole in all of Libestal.
