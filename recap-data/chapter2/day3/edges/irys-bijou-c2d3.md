<!-- title: Birthday Girl -->

Her shop? *Tampered with*? Her very own **HPO's Sick Deals**, the proud little pink stand where not a single transaction had ever occurred? That was the call the Pink One received from her brother—reporting a suspicious figure meddling with her beloved store.

Alarm bells rang. The pink lady rushed to the scene, heart pounding, ready to confront whatever culprit dared to mess with her turf.

But what she found was far from a confrontation.

From the middle of her shop—specifically, from within a tree trunk that now stood suspiciously at the center of her home—her brother leaped out, bursting into a cheerful, familiar tune, wishing her a happy birthday.

Whatever tension she had (if she even had any to begin with) instantly melted away. The Pink One lit up like a candle, beaming from ear to ear, her worries forgotten.
