<!-- title: Wolves Before Harlots -->

After abruptly meeting at the Enchanted wagon, Cecilia and Gonathon return to the princess' chamber in order to rest. Unable to bear her burden anymore, Cecilia [confides her troubles](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?t=4770s) to Gonathon. Gonathon knows Immerkind's love to be true and pure and impores her to confess to the princess.

The friendship and support of Gonathon meant so much for Cecilia that she proposes to Gonathon to be her [best man, maid of honor, and best wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icdii90_vSA&t=5938s) at the wedding.

During a moment of respite after slaying the Stain King Elpis, Cecilia confides that her feelings are still tumultuous. Her heart once sought comfort in both [Iphania and Bae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icdii90_vSA&t=14096s) but she made the resolution to stay devoted to only the princess.

After the conquest of Star Site: Elpis and the Stronghold Ruins, Gonathon calls Cecilia and [tells her not to talk to the princess yet](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?t=17674s) for Gonathon is trying to assist Karia with getting together with Cecilia. Gonathon proclaims that perhaps The Outlander and Iphania are but related as siblings and cannot marry!

Cecilia concludes the day discussing her concerns about the ["In bread"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icdii90_vSA&t=22533s) occurences at the castle with Gonathon over the phone.
