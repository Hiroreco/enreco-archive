Being a CEO is hard work, and Roa found that the start of her day felt like a ~~EN~~ curse. But she persisted for profit, for The Gacharms shop, and, of course, for her beloved employees.

Still, Roa is a hero, and so she met with Nerissa and Tammy to enter the Stronghold of Ruination. There, they met with the Outlander and learned of his plight: trapped in the accursed ruin-touched prison, and the key to freeing him was to conquer the Stronghold. Understanding this, the trio [defeated the Stain King Proto](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=2575) with just a few mathematical hiccups along the way.

A revelation! Roa noted that the Outlander and Princess Iphania are enamored with each other, constantly keeping the other in their thoughts. Sadly, not an ounce of trust was given to the shining heroes by the Outlander, for he did not believe. Fellow feline Fia reassured them and suggested that they could become the hero Libestal needs. 

They found the Outlander and the Princess in the guest room, where the Princess urges them to work together. Roa watched the Outlander repeat his suspicions to the Princess as he left for the next ruins. Despite this unwarranted distrust, Roa could not help but coo at the lovebirds. However, Gonathon and Cecilia Immerkind soon insisted on a different [type of relationship between the two](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=3215). Roa interjected into the conversation, stating that it does not matter, for siblings still love each other, and love is love. Should siblings love each other as lovers? Love is **love**, Roa left it at that. 

Roa met the Hot Pink One and was fed by her [mouth-to-mouth](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=3485), to which Bijou expressed curiosity, but Roa and the Hot Pink One explained that it is something only adults do, though the conversation ultimately went nowhere since the brothers and Roa ate mouth-to-mouth-to-mouth.

Bijou and Roa left for their shop, and Roa was impressed by the profits made while she was away. Seeing that their inventory needed restocking, Roa took it upon herself to craft more charms, completing some more quests in the meanwhile to earn a bit more gold. The business with Peasant The Bae is also quite good, as the supplier brought back some Stain materials that Roa needed. But Bae brought more than just the goods; she brought back [a startling discovery of not just the Princess and Outlander, but of the true nature of Libestal as well](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=5595). Not surprised by the news that she already knew and unfazed by the newer revelation, Roa pointed out a key feature to support this: the Libestians all have the same face. Following Roa's keen observation, Bijou added that *they*, the heroes of Libestal from another world, have similar faces to each other, albeit differing in colors.

[We Are In-Bread, Glory to The Sandwich](#embed:https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=6208)

Roa is the ham in the sandwich; such a sentence may not have been spoken of before, but it is nonetheless true. Perhaps the trials of the day wore down on the businesswoman, perhaps something mysterious (sandwich) has spread over these bread-like, blocky lands. Whatever the cause, a cult was born, and their goal has never been clearer: to follow the bread and turn the entire world into one large sandwich. To accomplish this, they must bring other heroic ingredients into their fold and accept the inbreadness inside them.

Shifting her focus back on what truly matters: Gold, Roa knew [advertisement](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=7655) was key to ensuring that The Gacharms stayed relevant in the minds of her customers, which soon proved very effective as Bae wandered by, mentioning she received the ad, though she had skippa skippa it. Of course, it was only natural to send another one to Bae and others.

As her day drew to a close, Roa spruced up the shop's exterior, creating a much more chic design to reflect the growth of her business.

A third day was finished despite the rocky start. [Glory to the Sandwich](https://youtu.be/hpyRxse4zCw?t=11221).
