<!-- title: Hot Pink One -->
<!-- status: In-bread -->

IRyS—sleep-deprived, hungover, and absolutely _not_ helping her case with the [alcoholic](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=CgvbYR_kAf7Wh2dB&t=270) allegations—woke up on her third day in Libestal feeling like a stiff breeze could knock her over. But the spirit was still there. Groggy or not, the pink menace set off to knock out her daily quests.

That morning daze didn’t last long, though. A phone call from her brother snapped her back into reality: someone shady had been snooping around her shop. IRyS went to investigate, ready to confront a shadowy figure... only to be met with an unexpectedly wholesome surprise (see [IRyS-Bijou: Birthday Girl](#edge:irys-bijou)).

And just like clockwork, the pink one's gravitational pull for the weirdest of interactions went into effect. One after another, people kept walking up to her with the strangest of conversations (see [Cecilia-IRyS: Potential Cult](#edge:cecilia-irys)). At this point, she might as well start charging consulting fees.

Sketchy conversations behind her, IRyS moved on to the main event of the day: the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=EFADi02eXHVT3guy&t=2633). She joined up with her brother, the Peasant, and Shiori for the dungeon run. While it wasn’t a major dungeon, it had its fair share of threats—including the cruelest challenge of all: doing [basic math](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=AekGs4GK1BLtsKjh&t=3013). Still, they made it through—though, leading up to it, everyone was strangely eager to show off their [shiny PPs](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=oN4UqMFFhl86YwaP&t=2216) (peasant pickaxes, of course).

Post-dungeon, the group stuck together to retrieve a special record—IRyS’s [very own song](https://www.youtube.com/live/EKjcWfEGsB0?si=0I04ddSjUfu8ZX3v&t=6582)—from the site of her recovered memories.

Back in the kingdom, while looking for more errands to run, she overheard a familiar name. Tammy? Someone else was calling _her_ Tammy Tammy? Turning to the voice, she saw _her_ Tammy—center stage, surrounded by women. The pink one wasn’t thrilled (see [IRyS-Tam: Is This Jealousy?](#edge:irys-kronii)).

And then the day _really_ spiraled, as everyone started theorizing how they were all possibly inbred—sorry, _in-bread_. (see [Peasant the Bae](#node:bae)). Such a revelation would cause any sane person to suddenly want to, uh, _"sandwich"_ their little brother with their big buns.

A chaotic day woven into many stories, and as the day wound down, with chaos trailing behind her, IRyS wrapped up her night journaling her wild day with her brother, one bread at a time.
