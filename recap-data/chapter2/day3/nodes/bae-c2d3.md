[BAE IS RICH!](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=331)

Much has progressed since we last saw Peasant The Bae, for she is now a peasant only in title, with more gold in her pockets and her beloved "tHE dUMPSTER" nearing its grand opening.

But, more than wealth, fortune has also smiled on Bae for the Good Knight Gonathon has bestowed upon her a [hat](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=658). In gratitude, Bae gifted Gonathon with an enchanted pickaxe, which he named after Bae herself, and procured a loyal customer in him. Perhaps a friend.

Bae then met Elizabeth and was astounded! Beautiful, regal. The lady exuded an aura of a queen, just like in her mother's stories. Then Elizabeth offered a spar to build up Bae's courage and strength. A spar that she won, and in doing so, impressed the Red Knight so much that she offered future lessons and the title of "Pheasant" to Bae. And the possibility that Peasant The Bae may become a squireâ€”Elizabeth's. Though honored by the offer, Bae rejected it, as being a peasant is more than just monetary status. It is a title passed down by her dear Mother, [and a title Bae was proud to be born into.](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=1510)

The day goes on, but it would be incomplete without arguing with the Hot Pink One, as Bae would blatantly buy another chef's food in front of IRyS while criticizing her cooking skills. They would trade barbs to the amusement of those around them, Bijou even suggesting that the two may be fond of each other.

Bae would soon dive into the dungeon, meeting the famed Outlander and being tasked to help free him, which proved to be tricky since the challenges included [**Math**](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=3408). But it was no match for Bae's peasant intellect. The battles were arduous, but Bae, bolstered by the earlier spar, endured. Eventually, they would fight and win against Stain King Proto, receiving parts of Fia's _meowmery_, a treasured disc, and freeing the Outlander. Thankful, but distrusting, the hero was wary of them but nonetheless warned them of the lingering corruption within the kingdom.

They reported back to the Princess, Bae noticed a strange... sense of giddiness from Princess Iphania upon hearing of the Outlander's rescue. Methinks they are together, thought the Peasant. Perhaps the Outsider is the result of a [union between the two](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=4400).

After a small adventure to obtain the first disc from the previous dungeon, Bae set off to mine diamonds, but as she did, she noticed the concerning amount of death text from Immerkind. Worried, Bae called her. The Kind Knight was distraught. Bae, perplexed, asked to meet and suggested that Cecilia kill livestock in order to destress while she waited. Under the bridge, Cecilia mentioned a special bond with the Princess which shocked Bae, but she was reassured when Cecilia said that it was a different 'special' from their own. Soon Cecilia would reveal:

[They're... Siblings?!](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=6936)

Unbelievable. Bae called Gonathon to confirm the audacious revelation and could only stagger at his answer. A knight like Gonathon had no reason to lie. Bae could not doubt the knight, rather, the pieces were falling together too well. Every Libestan they met had a similar face, akin to the Princess and the Outlander's...

It is a different land to their own and a different norm, Bae reasoned, but unfortunately (or not) her Mother skipped this part of her education before she vanished. She had no siblings, so she could not understand. Soon, she and Cecilia told this truth to Tammy, who [heavily questioned](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=7979) its authenticity. Betrothed siblings. The news spread, Bae seeking to inform those around her and citing the trustworthy Gonathon as the source.

But the madness did not stop with Libestal. Eventually, Bae, Roa, Bijou, and IRyS would come to another conclusion: their faces looked alike. Ridiculous, but as they thought more, they couldn't deny it much longer. Bae would leave and then rejoin the group to see that a cult had formed: In-Bread.

A cult had formed, and Bae had joined them as their Tomato and would later attempt to indoctrinate others into their group. Their goal is to become a giant sandwich. Glory to the Sandwich.

Shortly after the brief, but lingering, insanity, Peasant The Bae returned to her would-be shop, and after hours of work, the fruits of her labor blossomed:

With the day almost at the end, Bae continued to do a few more quests to earn some coins and bought a few more charms to arm herself for future adventures. She would find a magnificent painting that truly honored the noble spirit of [Peasant The Bae](https://x.com/Mikururun/status/1899107067182411936) and adorn it as the finishing touch for her shop.

One last thing before she rests: with more money to spare, surely it wouldn't hurt to purchase another hat from the quest hall's shop. With a promise to earn the gold lost on the morrow, Bae bought the Stain hat and excitedly showed it to Bijou, who, upon seeing what now donned Bae's head, felt a shiver of unease. Bijou cautioned Bae to be careful and keep well. Bae, unaware of the warning, took little heed as she wrote down her day in her journal...
