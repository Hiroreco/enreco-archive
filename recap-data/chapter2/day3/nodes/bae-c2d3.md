[BAE IS RICH!](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=331)

Much has progressed since we last saw Peasant The Bae for she is now a Peasant only in title, with a whopping 4524 gold in her pockets. She has precured many materials from building blocks to diamonds and her beloved tHE dUMPSTER too is nearing it's completion - things are looking brighter.

Fortune has also smiled on Bae for upon meeting the Good Knight, Gonathan with a G, he has bestowed upon her a [hat](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=658). In gratitude, Bae gifts Gonathan with an enchanted pickaxe, which he named after Peasant The Bae herself, and procured a loyal customer in him. Not to be outdone, Gonathan would gift Bae greater upgrade stones. 

Soon, Bae would meet Elizabeth and was astounded! Beautiful and strong, though not of royalty, she exudes an aura of a Queen, just like in Bae's Mother stories. They would exchange numbers and after conversing, Elizabeth offered a spar in order to build up Bae's courage and strength. Bae would win against, Elizabeth, impressed would offer future lessons and a title of "Pheasant" and that perhaps, one day Peasant The Bae may become a squire - Elizabeth's. Honoured by the offer, Bae rejected it as Peasant is more than just monetary status, it is a Title from her dear Mother. [Bae was born one and will be one for eternity](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=1510). 

The day goes on but as seen before, a day without arguing with the Hot Pink One is a day incomplete; as Bae would blatantly buy another chef's food in front of IRyS, whilst criticizing her cooking skills. They would trade barbs to the amusement of those around them, Bijou even suggesting that two may be fonder of each other in actuality.

The group, along with Shiori, would dive into the dungeon meeting the famed Outlander. There they learn more of the ruination and sought to free the hero. This dungeon proved to be trickier than the last for it had included [**Math**](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=3408) but it proved no match for Bae's Peasant Intellect. The battles fought were arduous but boosted by the spar early on Bae endured. Eventually, they would fight and win against Stain King Proto, receiving parts of Fia's *meowmery* and treasured disc.

Outlander was then freed from the ruins and tells that this ruin is merely connected - there is another one out there. Despite being distrustful of those who just saved him, he warns them: corruption still held the kingdom in its grasp. Fia would later suggest that perhaps, it should be Bae and her companions to truly save the world and not the Outlander.

They report back to the Princess, Bae noticed a strange... sense of giddiness from the Princess Iphania upon hearing of the Outlander's rescue. Methinks they are together, thought the Peasant. That perhaps, The Outsider is the result of a [union between the two](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=4400). 

Bae would continue questing, seeking to take hold of the disc from the first dungeon, she would head there once again along with her group. Disc obtained, they disbanded and Bae set off to mine more diamonds. 

As mined, Bae noticed the concerning amount of death text from Immerkind and called her. Hearing her distraught, Bae grew worried and perplexed asked to meet. While her Immerkind waits for her, Bae suggested for her to kill any of the livestock in order to relieve some of the stress. Upon meeting her, Cecilia mentioned a special bond with the princess which shocked Bae but after reassurance that it was different special bond from theirs relaxed. But then, dropped the bombshell:

[They're... Siblings?](#embed:https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=6936)

In shock at the revelation of such a relation, Bae would call Gonathan with a G to confirm what Cecilia said and could only stagger that the Good Knight repeated the answer. There was no reason for Gonathan to lie to her, so Bae did not doubt the knight, rather, the pieces were falling together too well. Every Libestian they met has a similar face, like the Princess and the Outlander...

It is a different land to their own and a different norm. Bae would know more but unfortunately (or not) her Mother skipped this part of her education before she vanished. She has no siblings so she cannot understand. Soon, she and Cecilia would relay this information to Tammy who too would [heavily question](https://youtu.be/Lp7GyRVbz1c?t=7979) Gonathan. Betrothed siblings. A truly earth-shattering knowledge is now in Bae's hands. Naturally, the news must spread and so Bae would inform those around her, citing the Gonathan as the source.

Eventually this would lead to Bae, Roa, Bijou, and IRyS to come to another conclusion: Their faces too are alike. Ridiculous, it was at first but as they thought more, denial escaped them. Bae would leave and then rejoin the group to see that a cult had formed: In-Bread.

A cult had formed and Bae had joined them as their Tomato and would later attempt to indoctrinate others into their group. Their goal is to become a giant sandwich. Glory to Sandwich.

Shortly after the brief, but lingering, insanity, Peasant The Bae returned to her would-be shop and after hours of work the fruits of her labour blossomed:

With the day's almost at the end, Bae would continue to do a few more quests to earn some coin and bought a few more charms, Glory to Sandwich, to arm herself for future adventures. She would find a magnificent painting that truly honours the noble spirit of [Peasant The Bae](https://x.com/Mikururun/status/1899107067182411936) placing it as a finishing touch for her shop.

But wait, one last thing. With more money to spare, surely it wouldn't hurt to purchase a from one of the vendors. With a promise to earn the gold lost on the morrow, Bae bought the hat and would excitedly share it with Bijou. Bijou, upon seeing what now donned Bae's head, felt a shiver of unease.  She cautioned Bae to be careful and kept well. Bae unawares of the warning, took little head as she wrote down her day in her journal...
