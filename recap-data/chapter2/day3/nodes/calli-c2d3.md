Awooooo! That’s right—that’s the call of the wolf pack. Not dawgs anymore—*wolves*. Having already finished pretty much everything she set out to do, the tavern owner found herself with time to spare, so she did what any loyal alpha would do: hang out with her pack and help out wherever needed (see [Calli-Gonathon: Animals](#edge:calli-gigi-bottom-1-bottom-3)). Along the way, she also passed through conversations so questionable they could raise even the sternest of eyebrows.

But it wasn’t all frolicking and playful banter. One of Mordon’s main objectives was to investigate the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/uX0rZYSrb4Q?si=aLBbcb29JY8k7qre&t=4924). So, alongside her wolf pack, she delved into the dark halls and shadowed corners, uncovering key secrets about the Outlander—and perhaps even deeper truths about the kingdom itself.

Among their findings was a hidden artifact: the music disc *Monster*. Naturally, the pack promised to jam out to it later, and some members got *very* excited.

Now, with the tavern finished and the therapy center up and running, Mordon found herself at a crossroads. What next? After some contemplation, she landed on an idea—a big one. It was time to build a [*Chef Guild*](https://www.youtube.com/live/uX0rZYSrb4Q?si=w1SXzcLHIPpTg1mi&t=6893). No more rivalry or sabotaging, just chefs—together, united by flavor over failure.
