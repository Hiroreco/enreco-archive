#### Main Story

The second dungeon, **Stronghold of Ruin**, was where the heroes first encountered the nameless swordsman known as the **Outlander** and helped free him from being trapped within its depths.

The Outlander shared a deep, unspoken bond with the Princessâ€”one that suggested he would go to any length to see her dreams fulfilled, even if it meant defying the calamity itself to save the world.
