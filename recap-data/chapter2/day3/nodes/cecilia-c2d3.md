<!-- title: Cecilia Immerkind -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Cecilia awakens from a restful sleep in the princess' bed and begins her day by visiting Iphania to make a pledge to [protect the here and now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icdii90_vSA&t=1090s). Immerkind departs for the town to win the hearts and minds of the citizens by defeating countless stains, distributing crucial supplies, and listening to their fears and concerns in order to show that she might be worthy of the princess.

During these forays into the field, she encounters Gonathon who requires protection. Cecilia resolutely stands and protects [her dawg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icdii90_vSA&t=3608s) from the countless Stains as they encroach upon the enchanted wagon.

As the two spend time together, Cecilia and Gonathon return to her "room," where they take a moment of respite. Unable to bear her burden any longer, she [confides the troubles](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?t=4770s) of her heart to Gonathon. Gonathon knows Immerkind's love to be true and pure and implores her to confess to the princess (see [Cecilia-Gigi](#edge:cecilia-gigi)).

Cecilia immediately seeks an audience with the princess and is heartbroken to find that Iphania's (see [Cecilia-Iphania: Just Siblings?](#edge:cecilia-iphania)) mind is only focused on the Outlander. Cecilia and Gonathon depart; tension runs high as Iphania seems blind to the pure emotions that Immerkind has for her. But Gonathon persuades Cecilia and tells her she may still have a chance and that Iphania's free will may be imprisoned by court politics.

After regaining her wits, Cecilia proposes that Gonathon become her [best man, maid of honor, and best wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icdii90_vSA&t=5938s) at the eventual wedding. After a moment of respite, and despite the storm in her heart, she agrees to assist Gonathon with Star Site Elpis, alongside Nerissa and Princess Bijou.

They work together to defeat the Stain King once more and uncover a hidden artifact known as the [Caesura of Despair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icdii90_vSA&t=10650s). The party celebrates at the Hot Pink One's house, a welcome respite for Immerkind as she shares a beautiful moment surrounded by her friends and comrades.

After a brief moment of respite and retooling, the Wolfpack Team (Gonathon, Mordan, Cecilia, and Karia) departs for the Stronghold Ruin to rescue the Outlander. Cecilia slays countless Stains and solves [difficult puzzles](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?si=2MtGJDNGarHGSAuW&t=16129) utilizing her +99 INT to reach the end of the dungeon. After the challenge, the team celebrates at Mordan's reputable establishment and [parties in Mordan's pit](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?t=17430s).

Gonathon later calls Cecilia and tells her not to talk to the princess yet and to go on an adventure with her because [wolf pack before...](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?si=_TcyB6TwuOqLVVYO&t=17714). However, Cecilia accidentally runs into Gonathon at the Library, who then implores her to consider her cousin as a potential love interest, but Cecilia rapidly departs to meet the princess, who is still absorbed with the Outlander.

Cecilia convenes with the Outlander and Princess but believes they are siblings and cannot be married. But this belief is dashed when Roa mentions that [love is love](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?t=19375s) which leaves Cecilia heartbroken and confused as the Outlander is still a potential love rival.

Cecilia tries various attempts to [resolve](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?si=0cVW52wBSJBoDRwe&t=19554) the situation; however, she cannot rid herself of this world. Peasant the Bae and Tam Gandr [spend time](https://www.youtube.com/live/Icdii90_vSA?si=Z-WNC8IAZsHqyGHB) with Cecilia to help ease the hurricane of feelings in her chest.

After a moment to clear her thoughts and a quick discussion with the princess where Tam Gandr and Cecilia share a [customary kiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icdii90_vSA&t=21964s), Cecilia writes in her diary and realizes that maybe the princess' heart is better in the care of someone else.
