Hmmm… maybe churning butter 24/7 wasn’t the smartest path to riches—Shiori came to that realization eventually. In hindsight, yeah, it made sense. So a new business model was in order. It wasn’t that she was broke—she’d done *plenty* of scamming to stay afloat—but even a con artist needs a steady income.

So what if, instead of selling food… she sold *fanfics*?

Writing had always been her thing. Her mind was a swirling enigma of oddities and brilliance, so why not put it to use? But before diving into her soon-to-be award-winning debut, she had some hero duties to knock out first. With Bijou, IRyS, and Bae by her side (strange comrades who kept talking about [shiny PPs](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=mrbHkeRHaHJ4S9E_&t=824)) Shiori helped investigate the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=zG-ew6n0Tlswdg3s&t=1239)—snarking all the way through about the [Outlander](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=LS1xN-4KPGBFQuTx&t=2884) and the Princess, of course.

Then, back to serious matters. The novel.

A world of fantasy, time travel, cutthroat capitalism, minimum wage labor—there was *so* much material to draw from. But something was missing. The stories were too… tame. And then, divine inspiration struck: *yaoi*.

Novel complete.

Next hurdle? How to market it. How to make money off it. Luckily for her, Shiori knew just the knight to manipulate—I mean, humbly ask for help (see [Shiori-Gonathon: The Diamond and the Black Pearl](#edge:gigi-shiori-top-2-bottom-1)).

She ended her day documenting her day in her journal, about the new bonds she'd just made with the humble knight.

Also, she received a [spam letter](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=FoTEQfKL0AN1cOd5&t=10362). Just a little cherry on top.
