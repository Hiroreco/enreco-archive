Hmmm… maybe churning butter 24/7 wasn’t the smartest path to riches—Shiori came to that realization eventually. In hindsight, yeah, it made sense. So a new business model was in order. It wasn’t that she was broke—she’d done _plenty_ to stay afloat—but even a con artist needs a steady income.

So what if, instead of selling food… she sold _fanfics_?

Writing had always been her thing. Her mind was a swirling enigma of oddities and brilliance, so why not put it to use? But before diving into her soon-to-be award-winning debut, she had some hero duties to knock out first. With Bijou, IRyS, and Bae by her side (strange comrades who kept talking about [shiny PPs](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=mrbHkeRHaHJ4S9E_&t=824)) Shiori helped investigate the [Stronghold of Ruin](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=zG-ew6n0Tlswdg3s&t=1239)—snarking the entire way through about the [Outlander](https://www.youtube.com/live/gVAtGMLBJos?si=LS1xN-4KPGBFQuTx&t=2884) and the Princess, of course.

Then, back to serious matters. The novel.

A world of fantasy, time travel, cutthroat capitalism, and minimum wage labor—there was _so_ much material to draw from. But something was missing. The stories were too… tame. And then, divine inspiration struck: _yaoi_.

The next hurdle? Marketing it. Figuring out how to make money off it. Luckily, Shiori knew just the right person to humbly request assistance from.

It had been three days since she first got to know the Orange Knight. Gullible, no doubt about that. At first, she’d only seen him as a convenient pawn—someone easily swayed, someone useful. But something had changed. Somewhere between the sly grins and half-meant jokes, between her calculated words and his sincere responses, something began to stir in her.

A warmth.

It was subtle at first, just a flicker. But now, it burned just enough for even a witch like her to take notice. And maybe… just maybe, it was something she didn’t want to ignore (see [Shiori-Gonathon](#edge:gigi-shiori)).

Afterward, she ended the day documenting her experiences in her journal about the new bonds she'd just made with the Humble Knight.

Another page written, another memory safely archived.

Pen and paper—tools Shiori was intimately familiar with. After all, she was an archiver. She had admitted it openly, even boasted about the title—though what it truly meant remained unclear. Still, it hinted at something deeper, that beyond her penchant for writing questionable novels on even more questionable subjects, the witch and her ever-faithful quill held the power to write something far more important.

Something that could change her view in the others' eyes.
