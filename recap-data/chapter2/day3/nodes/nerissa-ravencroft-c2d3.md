Business seemed to be picking up at *Nibs 'n Nobs* today! There was also [intriguing fashion](https://youtu.be/vMdhvi8dHN4?t=895s) about the streets — perhaps today was going to be a pleasant day.

A date's a date; Nerissa tagged along with Bijou on a search for a [secret](https://youtu.be/vMdhvi8dHN4?t=3876s), only this time as an escort team to accompany Gonathon on his first foray through Star Site: Elpis.

In anticipation of tougher battles ahead, she finally paid a little visit to the butsling *GaCharms* next door. The pity system was great, but the real pull of the place was the people (what the [dawgs](https://youtu.be/vMdhvi8dHN4?t=4441s) doin'?)

Nerissa had a sincere appreciation for her transactional relationship with the Jade Forge, but since recovering bits and pieces of lost tidings, she wondered if the scarlet knight had held back on divulging details about their thorny past. With that being said, the butterfly effect set in motion by an innocent [slip of the tongue](https://youtu.be/vMdhvi8dHN4?t=6520s) were beyond foresight of chivalry, no matter how great.

While waiting for Pandora's arrival to attempt today's dungeon, Nerissa burned her extra time getting in touch with a [long-lost vice](https://youtu.be/vMdhvi8dHN4?t=8514s).

Nerissa shared great excitement with some others over the Outlander's fond interactions with the Princess; then again, [who wouldn't be](https://youtu.be/vMdhvi8dHN4?t=12507s)? The two Libestal figures seemed close with one another.

As luck would have it, Nerissa lived a relatively slow life in Libestal, seeing as she had no relationship prospects going on — none that she's aware of — and how she was pretty much oblivious to any of the great love entanglements. Until today, that is. (see: [IRyS-Tam: Is This Jealousy?](#edge:hot-pink-one-tam-gandr-right-2-left-2))

Divine intervention saw to it that she experienced today's chaos no longer — she retreated promptly to the Library, preparing to retire from this realm. Although her doubts about her place in the world to bubble and brew, she asserted that "perserverence" was key, and she closed the book on her journey so far with a pen of her signature; ["Neriss (Juliet Bloodflame) Ravencroft"](https://youtu.be/vMdhvi8dHN4?t=13486s).
