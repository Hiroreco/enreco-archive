Tam might not have had an active "point of view" today, but that didn’t stop the chaos from finding her anyway. Let’s recap…

— Pulled into a full-blown soap opera with her supposed girlfriend? Check. 
(see [IRyS-Tam: My Best Nightmare](#edge:hot-pink-one-tam-gandr-right-2-left-2))

— Unwillingly involved in a bread-based cult where people are brainwashed into becoming into baked goods? Check.
(see [Peasant The Bae](#node:peasant-da-bae))

— Thrown headfirst into a sibling drama that teetered dangerously close to something out of an ancient royal family tree (incest—for short)? Check.
(see [Immerkind](#node:cecilia-immerkind))

— Somehow ended up joining a wolf pack in the middle of it all? Check.
(see [Gonathon-Tam: Awooo](#edge:tam-gandr-gonathon-g-right-2-bottom-1))
Yep, that about sums it up.
