Today was the official opening of Gacharms to great success. Many of the warriors went to the shop throughout the day, usually pulling more than once. This certainly helped the others with their side quests and dungeoning—ESPECIALLY the dungeon.

That wasn’t all that was on Bijou’s mind today, far from it. She sniffed out something fishy between the Outlander and the Princess, as their dialogue made it sound like they could be related. She wasn’t the only one to pick up on this, as rumors about this started to spread like wildfire from other sources.

Innocent Bijou would catch wind of some peoples’ conversations  around town while doing her quests, making her stand as still as a rock to listen. In one such case [she was caught standing in plain sight](https://youtu.be/A97SrozF36w?t=16800) with her mouth agape. Eventually, she decided she couldn’t just stand around. Something about pink ladies being related to each other? She had to learn more.

Things REALLY started to turn on its head when Bae started spilling the tea with her. She had heard from Cecilia Immerkind about the Outlander and the Princess being SIBLINGS. She also brings up something Tammy apparently said to her: what if the citizens of Libestans are inbred? This causes Bijou and the two pink ladies next to her (Roa and IRyS) to spiral. They all notice similarities with the faces of the Libestans… and each other. What if THEY were inbred themselves? […LITERAL in-*bread*s?](https://youtu.be/A97SrozF36w?t=18688) From this, a cult of in-breads rises.

Word also started going around about a haunted cape going around town, according to her brother IRyS. Bijou didn’t seem to buy it because she saw him drink a potion of invisibility in front of him mere minutes before. Taking a page from her brother, however, she decided to sneak a listen of a conversation IRyS had with Tam Gandr, causing Bijou to become the very thing IRyS warned about… but worse.

The rest of the day was calmer by comparison as others left for the day. After writing her daily journal entry, Roa and Bijou start polishing up the shop’s exterior. She signs the book at the end of the day, left wondering what will come of everyone’s relationships tomorrow.
