<!-- title: The Outlander -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Having long heard tales and legends of the enigmatic hero known as the Outlander, our heroes finally stood face-to-face with the man himself. He spoke with weariness and weight in his voice, revealing his current plight—locked in a struggle to keep the creeping Stains at bay. In doing so, he had become trapped and warned the heroes to stay away.

But he had sorely underestimated them.

Defying his expectations, the heroes pushed forward and conquered the Stronghold of Ruin, and ultimately freed the Outlander from his prison.

Though no longer bound, he remained cautious, skeptical of their purpose. He challenged the heroes’ claims of a destined fate, as they told him that if he were to save the world, it might give rise to a greater evil. But he didn’t believe them—he couldn’t.

He offered no further explanation. With cryptic words hanging in the air, he turned away and disappeared, heading to wherever fate next called him.

But oddly enough, he was found in the castle of Libestal's guest room, having a one-on-one conversation with the Princess (see [Outlander-Princess: The Next Step](#edge:iphania-outlander)).
