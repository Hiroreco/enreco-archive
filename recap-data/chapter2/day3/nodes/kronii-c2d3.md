<!-- title: Tam Gandr -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Tam might not have had an active "point of view" today, but that didn’t stop the chaos from finding her anyway. Let’s recap…

— Pulled into a full-blown soap opera with her supposed girlfriend? Check.
(See [IRyS-Tam: My Best Nightmare](#edge:irys-kronii))

— Unwillingly involved in a bread-based cult where people are brainwashed into becoming baked goods? Check.
(See [Peasant The Bae](#node:bae))

— Thrown headfirst into a sibling drama that teetered dangerously close to something out of an ancient royal family tree (incest—for short)? Check.
(See [Immerkind](#node:cecilia))

— Somehow ended up joining a wolf pack in the middle of it all? Check.
(See [Gonathon-Tam: Awooo](#edge:kronii-gigi))

Yep, that about sums it up.
