Today was set to be a simple one for Miss Bloodflame. Nothing grand or intense—just what she’d call a "guerrilla" adventure, aimed mostly at catching up on quests and general progress.

Right at the start, she received a call from Shakira, who generously offered her assistance with anything she needed—being ahead of the game and all. The Red Knight appreciated the gesture (see [Kiara-Elizabeth: Sugar Phoenix](#edge:kiara-liz)).

One of her main goals today was to finally get a portrait done—she was the only one without one, and frankly, it was about time. After some back-and-forth to gather materials (missing her horse dearly in the process), she finally got her painting. And it was beautiful.

She then moved on to gathering materials, completing side quests, and finally pulling herself out of single-digit coin status. Along the way, she crossed paths with others, even engaging in friendly duels—one of which was with the witch herself (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Strawberry Red](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

With her tasks wrapped up (and [pranks](https://www.youtube.com/live/CVF91CqGD80?si=AEpkx-sq8MxwFXQM&t=8458) delivered), the Red Knight headed to bed. A wise move, really—she ended up avoiding... whatever chaos went down afterward.
