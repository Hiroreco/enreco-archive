## Day 3: The Libestal Incest Situation Is Crazy

Before diving into the juicy chaos, let’s get the “non-important” stuff out of the way.

On the task front, the day largely revolved around two recurring themes for our heroes: grinding and material gathering. They spent time upgrading their weapons, expanding their businesses, and most notably, investigating the **Stronghold of Ruin**. It was there they encountered the mysterious, nameless swordsman—**the Outlander**—for the first time. He revealed more about his role in this tangled tale and the looming catastrophe tied to the fate of the world.

That was how the day *should’ve* gone. But now, let’s talk about the absolute fever dream that was Day 3.

If you've been paying attention, you’d notice that relationships among the heroes have always been... layered. From lovers to sworn brothers, strangers to long-lost cousins, familial themes have been running strong through the kingdom—and on the surface, that sounds wholesome. Heartwarming, even.

But no. Apparently, the idea of “family” got a little *too* medieval for our band of “heroes.” Somewhere along the way, what began as playful speculation took a hard swerve into *full-on incest*. That's right—*sweet home Alabama* levels of chaos.

We had people assuming the kingdom’s ruler and her companions were both siblings *and* lovers. We had a cousin—yep, a cousin—making moves on a relative, and upon getting rejected, nearly spiraled into an emotional breakdown. And from the ashes of all this confusion came the crackpot theory to top all crackpot theories: *everyone* in the kingdom was somehow related. All of them. An entire world of inbred individuals. And from this madness was born a cult. A cult of carbs. The In-Breads. Yes, a religion that believed people were bread—sandwiches even—born of divine inbreeding.

Sure, there were also love stories. Drama... Wolf pack? Maybe even a couple of healthy, emotionally stable conversations. But none of that mattered. It all got absolutely steamrolled by the unhinged shenanigans of the day. Up, down, left, right—wherever you looked, it was chaos.

And the spark that might’ve lit this family-fueled dumpster fire? One orange, fiery bird lady. Who needs logic, morals, or restraint... when you’ve got *family*, right?
