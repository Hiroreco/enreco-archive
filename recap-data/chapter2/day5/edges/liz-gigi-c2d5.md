<!-- title: Honor and Justice -->

Throughout Gonathon’s trials and tribulations, a keen eye was observing and keeping track of her. No longer able to continue passively watching, Gonathon’s fellow knight Elizabeth called Gonathon, stating that she wished to speak in private. Despite having not interacted much with Liz in the current Libestal, this conversation would prove to have an immense impact on the both of them. 

Calling Gonathon to her home, the two at first attempted to have a conversation in [the Jade Forge’s basement](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=9708), but upon being stalked by interlopers, Liz led Gonathon through a secret passage. There in private, Liz scolded Gonathon for associating and giving money to [witches](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=9885), despite her own obvious affinity for one. This teasing soon led to a warm exchange, with Gonathon regaling Liz with the adventures of the Wolf Pack and Liz giving Gonathon some wise words on the nature of love and duty.

Liz and Gonathon realized that they shared an intense bond, even if they did not know exactly what it was, and agreed that they shared a fellow kinship with Roa and Immerkind. Determined to uphold their knightly honor and do what was right for their friends and the people, the two promised to uphold their vow as [the Knights of Justice](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10950), and fight together for what they believed in. Sharing a bro hug, the two parted ways, their determination to fight for their code and beliefs burning brighter than ever before.

While this was the end of Gonathon’s interactions with Liz for the day, it was not the end of the advice she would receive. For a [strange, floating cape](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11687) would appear before Gonathon and lecture the humble knight on whether she was making the right choices. This exchange further hardened Gonathon’s resolve, and with her knightly code firmly engraved on her heart once more, she set out to set things to right.
