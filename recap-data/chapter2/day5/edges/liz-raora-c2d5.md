There was something familiar about Lady Elizabeth Bloodflame. Was it her strength? Her alluring beauty?

Soft hands tenderly patted her head as Lady Elizabeth's laugh softly rang in Roa's ears.

Or was it her kindness that attracted Roa to her?

After the warm greeting, Roa watched the Scarlet Knight approach the Gacharms shop, inquiring about the charms they sell and what they would advise her to use. There was a sense of pride Roa felt as she watched Bijou handle the deal.

The Knight grew stronger from their charms. Roa admired Elizabeth's strength since she could only dream of being as strong as she was.

Elizabeth would humbly brush off Roa's compliment, pointing out that Roa herself was quite helpful in the dungeon the other day.

Pleased by the compliment, Roa watched the Knight leave. The whole segment, however, got the furry pink's heart all flusterd.

But it seemed Elizabeth was popular; Roa [watched](https://www.youtube.com/live/iWSC8XgRlqA?si=wEybCi_1CNOe_S9x&t=2717) her and Nerissa in the distance, her god-eyes sparking as she spied on the two converse. Jealousy sparked when Bijou mentioned Roa shouldn't leave the two alone. Though Elizabeth seemed to avoid looking at Nerissa, it didn't change the way Nerissa searched for Elizabeth.

Roa might be a pretty kitty, but she was a persistent panther too, soon buying gifts and leaving them in Elizabeth's room.

Only time will tell if she can make The Scarlet Knight hers.
