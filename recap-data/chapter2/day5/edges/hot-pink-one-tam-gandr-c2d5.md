<!-- title: Abdomen Pain -->

Red flags had been waving wildly for a while now, and Miss Tammy’s crush—Miss Pinky—was stacking them like achievements. [Mouth-feeding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=12416s) her business partner and brother, sensually. Asking Tammy to wear a [maid outfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=9123s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH ) and say the cringiest lines. Flirting openly with her wedded partner while treating Tammy like a convenient side quest. 

But Tammy was no better, she was two timing, with another pink one.

So disaster was bound to strike for these two to be together.

Out of nowhere, the pink one, casually dropped the bomb that she was pregnant—with someone else’s child. Yes, pregnant. That little detail.

The reveal was so shocking it rendered Tammy mute. But really—why? What exactly was Pinky trying to accomplish here? Make Tammy jealous? Stir some kind of reaction? If so, it failed spectacularly. Tammy wasn’t impressed. In fact, she was straight-up repulsed.

And as if embarrassed by her own failed bit, Pinky spiraled. Dramatically. Talking about committing sudoku levels of melodrama.

She even found a cliff to jump off. Her brother tried to stop her… and ended up jumping too. Don’t worry—they came back immediately. Because dying isn’t an option here. But the stomach pains? Gone. So was it a miscarriage… or just gas? Let’s go with gas.

Honestly, what even was this storyline supposed to be?
