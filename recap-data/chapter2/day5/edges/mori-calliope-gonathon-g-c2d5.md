Upon awaking for a new day, the blissfully unaware Mordan Ramsey was greeted by the aftermath of the firestorm of tragedy that had befallen Libestal, with her primary duty now to consoling a distraught Gonathon who had sent her a flurry of letters begging for aid the night before. 

Pulling Gonathon into her therapy room, Mordan was immediately met by an apology from Gonathon who felt guilty for the disastrous blind date the night before, and further asked why Mordan even liked her in the first place. The sagely Mordan then began to tell a love story between a kindhearted knight and a maiden that seemed [eerily familiar](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=974), but Gonathon continued to insist she was not worthy of love and loyal to her queen. Mordan insisted that blind loyalty was “ick” and that Gonathon needed above all else to make decisions for her own sake. Gifting Gonathon a beautiful mural of herself (which Gonathon sneakily returned the favor by placing her own mural in Mordan’s home) the two parted for the time being. 

Later, the wolf pack once again assembled to delve into a dungeon. It was here that the wily Shakira (see [Gonathon-Kiara: Swords to Plowshares](#edge:gonathon-g-takanashi-kiara-left-2-bottom-2)) once again brought the therapist and knight together by convincing Mordan to [groom](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=5062) the scruffy knight of the flees afflicting her. The pack then descended into the dungeon, and although difficult they easily proved victorious. Having overcome two trials with Gonathon, one of the mind and another of the realm, the two seemingly said farewell for the day.

Alas for poor Mordan, this trials would pale in comparison to what would come next, however the hardship would come not from the knight, but from the quarrelling Peasant Bae and Princess Bijou (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:peasant-da-bae-koseki-bijou-bottom-1-bottom-2)) who were engaged in a custody battle for Khaos. The lengthy, grueling couples therapy that followed saw Gonathon serving as a voice of reason, but sadly the other three left in disgust following an outburst by Mordan calling out what she saw as their prejudices.

A crestfallen Mordan vowed to give up therapy forever, but Gonathon insisted her skills had proven invaluable to bringing the knight back from the brink of despair. Trading places with Mordan, Gonathon now sat in the therapist’s chair. She repeated a [line of advice](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=13671) she had given Bijou days before: to not allow the misery of customer service take the twinkle out of her eye. The humble knight implored Mordan to take up fortune telling instead, as not only could she help people, but the blame would be solely on the gods. Thoroughly amused, Mordan replied she would consider it, and the two wolves ended their day on a much happier note than before.
