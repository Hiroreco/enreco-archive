<!-- title: Good Neighbors -->

If there was anyone that should be Gonathon's enemy this day, it would be Princess Bijou, who began pursuing Shiori of the Nyavellas mere minutes after the witch had broken off her relationship with Gonathon. 

But rather than view the young gem with spite, Gonathon instead wished to help her, starting with an [apology](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=8142) for the way that the knight had used Shiori as a means to heal her own heart. Bijou gave Gonathon some advice of her own, that perhaps the knight had simply not experienced love yet, and encouraged her to not give up in seeking her own happiness.

This exchange touched Bijou so much that she insisted that Gonathon be present as [moral support](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11861) for the no-holds-barred custody battle with Bae the Peasant over the child Khaos, and following the dispute ending amicably, inducted Gonathon into her new extended family, dubbed State Farm, as they were all good neighbors to one another.

While Bijou would ultimately take the side of HPO against Tam Gandr, this would not cripple the bond between princess and knight. Rather, Gonathon had simply cemented another friendship and righted another wrong she had inflicted on others the day prior.
