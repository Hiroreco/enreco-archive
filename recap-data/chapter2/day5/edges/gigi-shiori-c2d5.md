<!-- title: The Witch and Her Fumbling Knight -->

Following the events of the previous day, one would expect Shiori of the Nyavellas to want nothing to do with Gonathon. Somehow though a spark of interest remained for the bumbling knight, and Shiori was keen to not allow sleeping wolves to lie.

Gonathon began the day with the witch on her mind, but upon encountering her before the dungeon, Shiori seemed to avoid the knight, a fact which Gonathon was understanding of. It was to Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Good Neighbors](#edge:gigi-bijou)) that the subject of the witch would come to the spotlight, with Gonathon expressing her regret for using Shiori to fill the hole in her heart left by the loss of her Pearl. The witch and the knight would not stay apart for long though, and Gonathon soon found herself once again waiting outside Shiori’s door.

Overhearing a phone conversation between Shiori and Liz, Shiori held nothing back in expressing her disgust for Gonathon’s actions. This did not dent the knight’s resolve and she quickly confronted Shiori directly. The witch continued to [hold nothing back](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12262), referring to Gonathon as a fumbling knight and disparaging her for requiring so much support to commit to her actions in the past. Chief of all, Shiori presented a question that Gonathon had herself deeply considered: that Gonathon was simply treating her as a salve for her wounded heart, and that as a [Black Pearl](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12317), she was simply an imitation of the real thing.

Despite all that Gonathon had done, and despite admitting she was still a fool, Shiori could not deny her feeling that the knight deep down was a [good person](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=12416). Gonathon for her part apologized to the witch and expressed regret for the way she had treated her.
However, Gonathon’s role in Shiori’s story was far from over. Recruited by Bijou as a form of “moral support”, Gonathon played witness to the intense custody battle between Peasant the Bae and Shiori and Bijou. Wanting to play her own part in the child’s upbringing, Gonathon vowed to provide funds for child support, and in turn joined the newly formed State Farm family.

From there, Shiori would attempt to dissuade Gonathon from being too brash about assisting Tam Gandr, although her words were unable to restrain the loyal knight from leaping to her queen’s defense. As the witch and knight parted for the final time that day, it was abundantly clear that Shiori was far from done with the humble knight, and in some ways may just be getting started in pulling on her strings.
