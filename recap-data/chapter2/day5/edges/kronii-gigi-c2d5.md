<!-- title: The Sham Queen’s Sacrifice -->

As Gonathon roamed the lands righting her past wrongs, so too did Tam Gandr descend into the abyss of depravity and despair (see [Irys-Kronii: Abdomen Pain](#edge:irys-kronii)). For the queen had found herself not only destitute following several poor spending choices but had even ruined her relationships with the Hot Pink One and Roa. Stripped of her dignity and [blackmailed](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15489) by those she once loved, it was now her turn to seek the aid of the knight who, the previous day, she had wrenched from his own abyss.

Initially seeking therapy from Mordan, however, upon learning of her retirement, Tam begged Gonathon to help her. Spilling her guts about the horrific situation she found herself in, not even the revelation that Gonathon had somehow ended up in HPO’s service herself (see [Gonathon-Irys: No Goddesses or Queens, only Grems](#edge:irys-gigi)) could dissuade Tam from seeing the knight as her last hope. The queen’s faith was well placed, for upon hearing of Tam’s enslavement to HPO, Gonathon flew into a rage and implored the queen to fight for her dignity and status as a monarch.

Gonathon mused over their options, including taking HPO to court, while a shellshocked Tam thanked Gonathon for his [purity and unbreakable loyalty](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15872). Alas, nothing could be done at the moment, for the vile goddess had discovered Kronii and commenced ravaging her in front of the Humble Knight. Despite wishing to remain by her queen’s side, Tam’s tearful plea not to witness her humiliation forced Gonathon to retreat, but not before promising to return. Writhing with frustration over the queen’s plight, Gonathon was briefly consoled by Shiori and Bijou, but their words imploring the knight to not get involved only served to harden the knight’s resolve: he had to save his queen!

Rushing to her queen’s side once more, Gonathon was shocked to find that Tam Gandr had turned the tables on the degenerate pink Nephilim, who was now groveling at Tam’s feet. Joining forces with Tam, the two of them, along with Bijou, talked HPO out of [jumping to her demise](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17973) (although this did still occur, with Tam and Gonathon surviving the fall). Gonathon had a truly perplexing heart-to-heart with Tam and urged her to stand up for herself and earn more respect, along with cat-kissing rights. Flabbergasted, but still thankful for her knight’s steadfast loyalty, Tam praised Gonathon for all he had done. Witnessing one final exchange between HPO and the queen in which Tam stated that Gonathon was all she needed, Gonathon departed, content with the good deeds he had done for his beloved queen.
