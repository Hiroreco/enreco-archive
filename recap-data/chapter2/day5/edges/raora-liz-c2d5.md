<!-- title: Who's a Pretty Kitty, You are! -->

There was something familiar about Lady Elizabeth Bloodflame. Is it her strength? Her alluring beauty?

"Hello, Pretty Kitty!"

Soft hands tenderly patted her head. As Lady Elizabeth's laugh softly rang in Roa's ears.

Or is it her kindness that attracts Roa to her?

After the warm greeting, Roa watched the Red Knight approach The Gacharms shop, inquiring about the charms they sell and what would they advise for her to us. There's a sense of pride Roa felt as she watched Bijou handles the deal.

The Knight would only grow stronger from their charms. Roa admired Elizabeth's strength since she could dream to be as strong as her.

Elizabeth would humbly wave Roa's compliment, pointing that Roa's brains was quite helpful in the dungeon the other day.

Pleased by the compliment, Roa would watch the humble Knight leave. 

But it seems Elizabeth is popular;  Roa watched her and Nerissa in the distance, her god-eyes sparking as she spied the two converse. Jealousy sparked when Bijou mentioned Roa shouldn't leave the two alone. Though Elizabeth seemed to avoid looking at Nerissa, it doesn't change the way Nerissa searches for Elizabeth.

Roa might be a pretty kitty, but she is a persistant panther too, soon buying gifts and leaving them in Elizabeth's room.

Only time will tell if she can make The Red Knight hers.
