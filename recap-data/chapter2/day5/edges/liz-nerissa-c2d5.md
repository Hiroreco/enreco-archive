<!-- title: No Room for Drama -->

Reaching the fifth day of the journey without any conflicts or misunderstandings that could spark heartbreak, the bond between the scarlet knight and the blue raven lady officially broke their previous record. That’s progress, right? Hard to say—eye contact alone still seemed like a final boss fight.

These two were so harmoniously in sync that it felt almost impossible to imagine them ever getting into any real quarrel or drama—a stark contrast to nearly every other couple that day. Even when one tried to stir the pot a little, it always came out playful, silly, and undeniably wholesome.

It looked like there was an attempt—an honest effort—to stir up some drama. Elizabeth called Nerissa a witch, and Nerissa needing therapy because of being called said witch. But let’s be real here, that was just your average Tuesday for these two. Nothing out of the ordinary, even others joined in to entertain the bit.

And by day’s end, a quiet gesture: one secretly leaving a gift for the other. Amid all the chaos and absurdity around the kingdom, they found calm. A small, quiet day—simple, sweet, and shared.
