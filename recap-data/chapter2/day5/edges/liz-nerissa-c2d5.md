<!-- title: Doomed Yuri -->

**Elizbaeth's Point of View**

Reaching the fifth day of the journey without any conflicts or misunderstandings that could spark heartbreak, the bond between the scarlet knight and the blue raven lady officially broke their previous record. That’s progress, right? Hard to say—eye contact alone still seemed like a final boss fight.

These two were so harmoniously in sync that it felt almost impossible to imagine them ever getting into any real quarrel or drama—a stark contrast to nearly every other couple that day. Even when one tried to stir the pot a little, it always came out playful, silly, and undeniably wholesome.

It looked like there was an attempt—an honest effort—to stir up some drama. Elizabeth called Nerissa a witch, and Nerissa needing therapy because of being called said witch. But let’s be real here, that was just your average Tuesday for these two. Nothing out of the ordinary, even others joined in to entertain the bit.

And by day’s end, a quiet gesture: one secretly leaving a gift for the other. Amid all the chaos and absurdity around the kingdom, they found calm. A small, quiet day—simple, sweet, and shared.

**Nerissa's Point of View**

The snowball rolled, a quiet slide,
It started when I opened my eyes.
The [gallery](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=1510s)—gone, her work erased,
Why would she do that? I tried to chase
A reason, a whisper, a clue in the space.

She wouldn’t look—just me, [no glance](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=1950s).
Why skip me in that fleeting dance?
A name, a memory, she let slip near,
Of someone else, but not me, dear.
Why [bring her up](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=2130s)? Why now? Why here?

She [hit](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=2795s) my head, just for a hat,
Ignored my ask—just left like that.
Mid-discussion, no goodbye,
A cold gust passed; I wondered why.
What is she planning? A secret? A lie?

I followed, curious, heart in hand,
She turned and screamed—I didn’t understand.
[“Witch!”](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=2890s) she cried, again, again,
Not once in jest, it stung like then.
She chased me off like I’d done sin.

Later still, I sought to trade,
An Upgrade Stone, a fair exchange.
She stopped me short, said I had guessed
All wrong. My chest—tight, compressed.
Was I [unwelcome](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=2960s) now, unlike the rest?

Then—roses, [roses](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=12426s), her room aglow.
Not mine. Just others. A floral show.
Who sent them? Who gets to stay?
Why not me? I couldn’t say.
The thorns inside began to fray.

No meaning made, no truth aligned.
I searched her gaze—found no sign.
What does she want? Why can’t I see?
Is it her fault… or maybe me?
This storm won’t pass, it won’t let me be.

And so, I sat in quiet gloom,
My heart a ghost that filled the room.
All signs confused, all roads misled,
I told myself, “It’s over,”
And let the sadness spread.

...

Then—
A hand. A warmth. A [gentle pat](https://www.youtube.com/live/m5VOeHvSgbI?si=t7-UotzcICQjtvlw&t=16175).
A silly smile. A moment passed.
She called me “witch” with laughter now.
I felt the hurt begin to drown.
And just like that... I came back down.

If witch is what she wants from me,
Then so I’ll be, in full esprit.
I’ll stir my spells in pots of stew,
And wait until her heart shows through.

A love like ours, strange and sublime—
It hurts. It heals. It takes its time.
