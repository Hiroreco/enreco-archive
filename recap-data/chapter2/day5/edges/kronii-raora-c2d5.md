<!-- title: The Queen, A Maid For Two Pinks-->

It's strange how relationships develop over time. They begin in all shapes and forms—many who were once thought to be sworn enemies ended up becoming lovers. Such was the tale between the once two rival queens, one blue and one pink. And now, in this new journey, having not reconciled their relationship for a long time, they finally had a chance to reconnect. Well, “reconnect.”

Roa met Tam, and they shared an emotional moment upon realizing they remembered each other—how Roa used to call Tam everything but her actual name, how they constantly bickered, how they got married. Roa was emotional. Tam was too (not really—this whole reminiscence was actually just Tam’s attempt to get a discount from Roa). Nonetheless, the touching reunion led the two to reach an agreement, with Roa offering almost everything to her queen, reconnecting the two… for about a minute or two—before a certain Hot Pink One came into the picture.

You see, Tam was already in a relationship with the Hot Pink One. So it didn’t take long for the two pinks to realize that their blue queen was two-timing them.

In an attempt to atone for her sins—and to salvage her image—Tam declared she would do anything for forgiveness, not realizing just how much that statement would cost her pride, and eventually, her sanity. She pleaded with Roa, and the blue queen granted her mercy—under one condition: she would become their maid.
