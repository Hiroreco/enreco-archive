<!-- title: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved -->

As Jeweler and Supplier, Princess Bijou and the Peasant The Bae, had an amicable relationship; Bae selling her wares to Bijou for a discounted price and Bijou returning the goodwill with the highest quality charms The Gacharms had to offer. And Bijou doing math for 30 minutes for Bae.

But this friendship would be put to the test when Bae bought what seemed like a hat. A hat that Bijou couldn't help but eye with familiarity. 

Bijou was worried as memories of the past slowly returned to her. Something had happened, a terrible fate had befallen her and would have consumed her if not for others. A fate that Bijou feared the Peasant might experience herself.

Then, Bijou's memories wholly returned.

The hat on Bae's head wasn't an evil artifact! It was her child! Her child with her beloved Shiori Nyavella. 

And so, Bijou would plead to Bae for her child. To have Khaos back. For Shiori's sake. 

But rather than sympathy, Bae was appalled by Bijou's story. A child abandoned by both parents should be loved and looked after by someone who truly cared!

This dispute eventually led them to receive counselling form Mordan Ramsey in order to decide custody - then, visitation. 

It was a complicated matter fuelled by heated feelings from all sides that ultimately led to their therapist leaving and calling it a day and Bae and Bijou talking in Shiori's humble home.

As they watch Khaos and the second unnamed child Bae has adopted play together, the two make amends. They agreed that they both let their emotions overwhelmed them and that therapy was a waste of money and time.

Bae, who still had primary custody by the agreement of all parties involved, Bijou included, gave her blessing for Bijou to visit Khaos.
