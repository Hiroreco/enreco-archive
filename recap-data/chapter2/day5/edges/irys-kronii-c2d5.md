Red flags had been waving wildly for a while now, and Miss Tammy’s crush—Miss Pinky—was stacking them like achievements. [Mouth-feeding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=12416s) her business partner and brother, sensually. Asking Tammy to wear a [maid outfit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=9123s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH) and say the cringiest lines.

And honestly, at this point, the pink one was treating Tam like a hobby—just as she'd shamelessly claimed before. Barking orders at her like a pet—no, more accurately, like a maid—pulling her around, playing with her emotions, teetering between mock affection and cruel ridicule. Acting high and mighty, like some smug master lording over her loyal servant.

Tam, ever proud, ever regal—a Queen—had to grit her teeth and endure it all. Not because she wanted to, but because she chose to. For the pink one. Because... well, something about Tam allegedly cheating on her with another pink one, after that long string of [mentally draining](https://www.youtube.com/live/UyN7jwsiiXA?si=SGznht8by7Elxkr8&t=10852) dungeon runs she had with the two bubblegum heads.

It was rare—unheard of, even—to see Tam so vulnerable. And yet, there she was, all her pride swallowed just to hold onto something fleeting. And the worst part? It looked like Miss Pinky was enjoying every second of it.

So, of course, disaster was inevitable.

This kind of twisted dynamic was never built to last.

Out of nowhere, the pink one casually dropped the bomb that she was pregnant—with someone else’s child. Yes, pregnant. That little detail.

The reveal was so shocking it rendered Tammy mute. But really—why? What exactly was Pinky trying to accomplish here? Make Tammy jealous? Stir some kind of reaction? If so, it failed spectacularly. Tammy wasn’t impressed. She was straight-up repulsed.

And as if embarrassed by her own failed bit, Pinky spiraled. Dramatically. Talking about committing sudoku levels of melodrama.

She even found a cliff to jump off. Her brother tried to stop her... and ended up jumping too. Don’t worry—they came back immediately. Because dying isn’t an option here. But the stomach pains? Gone. So was it a miscarriage... or just gas? Let’s go with gas.

Honestly, what even was this storyline supposed to be?
