<!-- title: No Goddesses or Queens, Only Grems -->

After speaking of her reverence for the HPO for a few days, Gonathon finally had a meeting with the elusive pink trickster. Assisting HPO against a pack of voracious stains, Gonathon struck up a conversation with the wannabe deity. At this point the goddess simply demanded tribute and, busy with other tasks, Gonathon departed for the dungeon.

After assisting State Farm with couple’s therapy (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:bae-bijou)), Gonathon once again encountered HPO as she was desperately seeking therapy following a series of unfortunate events with Tam Gandr (see [Irys-Kronii: Nice Boat](#edge:irys-kronii)). Completely oblivious to the maelstrom of controversy that had erupted between the queen and the goddess, Gonathon offered to assist HPO despite being in opposing factions. For even if they could not be wolves, Gonathon would still serve as her [guard dog](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=14697). However the humble knight soon learned that her intended target would be none other than her beloved queen.

Tam quickly revealed to Gonathon the extent of HPO’s depravity (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Sham Queen Sacrifice](#edge:kronii-gigi)). Enraged over the treatment of her queen, Gonathon pleaded with Tam to not allow HPO to demean her in such a manner. Alas, Tam was seemingly powerless to oppose HPO, and upon HPO’s return and renewed degeneracy towards the queen, Gonathon was forced to make a tactical retreat at [Tam’s behest](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16162). 

Unwilling to simply abandon her queen to the deviant goddess, Gonathon rushed back in to assist Tam. It was there that Gonathon witnessed an incredible scene: Tam taking her words to heart and [bringing HPO to heel](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17471). HPO, shedding any semblance of being a respectable goddess, fled with her tail between her legs before threatening to jump to her demise. It was through the combined efforts of Gonathon, Tam, and Bijou that HPO was eventually talked down.

Following a bewildering, but heartfelt conversation with Gonathon, Tam was able to reconcile with HPO and react a mutual understanding that would see her honor restored and her cat kissing privileges upgraded. While HPO was quick to demean Gonathon, the queen hastily [defended](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=19836) the humble knight, who was watching in secret. And thus the most contrived filler arc came to a close.
