<!-- title: No Goddesses or Queens, Only Grems -->

After speaking of his reverence for the HPO for a few days, Gonathon finally had a meeting with the elusive pink trickster. Assisting HPO against a pack of voracious stains, Gonathon struck up a conversation with the wannabe deity. At this point the goddess simply demanded tribute, and, busy with other tasks, Gonathon departed for the dungeon.

After assisting State Farm with couple’s therapy (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:bae-bijou)), Gonathon once again encountered HPO as she was desperately seeking therapy following a series of unfortunate events with Tam Gandr (see [Irys-Kronii: Nice Boat](#edge:irys-kronii)). Completely oblivious to the maelstrom of controversy that had erupted between the queen and the goddess, Gonathon offered to assist HPO despite them being in opposing factions. For even if they could not be wolves, Gonathon would still serve as her [guard dog](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=14697). However, the humble knight soon learned that his intended target would be none other than his beloved queen.

Tam quickly revealed to Gonathon the extent of HPO’s depravity (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Sham Queen Sacrifice](#edge:kronii-gigi)). Enraged over the treatment of his queen, Gonathon pleaded with Tam to not allow HPO to demean her in such a manner. Alas, Tam was seemingly powerless to oppose HPO, and upon HPO’s return and renewed degeneracy towards the queen, Gonathon was forced to make a tactical retreat at [Tam’s behest](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=16162). 

Unwilling to simply abandon his queen to the deviant goddess, Gonathon rushed back in to assist Tam. It was there that Gonathon witnessed an incredible scene: Tam taking his words to heart and [bringing HPO to heel](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=17471). HPO, shedding any semblance of being a respectable goddess, fled with her tail between her legs before threatening to jump to her demise. It was through the combined efforts of Gonathon, Tam, and Bijou that HPO was eventually talked down.

Following a bewildering but heartfelt conversation with Gonathon, Tam was able to reconcile with HPO and reach a mutual understanding that would see her honor restored and her cat-kissing privileges upgraded. While HPO was quick to demean Gonathon, the queen hastily [defended](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=19836) the humble knight, who was watching in secret. And thus the most contrived filler arc came to a close.
