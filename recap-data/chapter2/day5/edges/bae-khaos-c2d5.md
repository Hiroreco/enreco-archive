<!-- title: CHAOS'S KHAOS -->

Khaos was a child that Bae first mistook as a hat when she happened upon her on the side of the street. Bae bought Khaos for 3000 gold, a hefty sum at the time, and the child soon found a comfortable home on Bae's head. Though it seems Bae has been quite off ever since meeting Khaos, perhaps it's just a coincidence.

Unbeknownst to Bae, since she denied the call to heroism in the first journey and thus missed many, many moments that occurred, Khaos is the child between Princess Bijou and Shiori Nyavella. The unfortunate child was abandoned and lost until Bae officially adopted her.

Though Day 5 was rather turbulent, it ultimately showed that Bae fully considers Khaos her own, fighting fiercely for primary custody and denying any visitation to those who may harm Khaos. Khaos too would seem very happy with Bae as well.
