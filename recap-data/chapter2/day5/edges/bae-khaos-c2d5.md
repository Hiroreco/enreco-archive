<!-- title: CHAOS'S KHAOS -->

A child that Bae first mistook as a hat when she happened upon her on the side of the streets. Buying Khaos for 3000 gold, a hefty sum for Bae then, she would soon find a comfortable home on Bae's head. Though it seemed Bae has been quite off ever since meeting Khaos, but perhaps that's happenstance.

Unbeknownst to Bae since she denied the call to Heroism to in Chapter 1 and thus missing many, many moments that occured; Khaos is actually the child between Princess Bijou and Shiori Nyavella. The unfortunate child was abandoned and lost until Bae officially adopted her 

Though Day 5 was rather turbulent, it ultimately showed that Bae fully considers Khaos her own, fighting fiercely for primary custody and denying any visitation to those who may harm Khaos. Khaos too would seem very happy with Bae as well.
