Despite previously being suspicious of Peasant the Bae, Gonathon would come to forge a strong friendship with her that day. Bae, having previously attempted to assist Gonathon in the previous day’s trials with Shiori of the Nyavellas, was deeply concerned with the knight’s wellbeing. Upon assuring Bae she was doing better, Gonathon responded by asking what was on the peasant’s mind. Bae proceeded to spill her guts: that she was [in love with Immerkind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=1994s) but hesitant to express her feelings due to Immerkind’s obsession with the Princess of Libestal.

Gonathon rebuffed her concerns, stating that she should [follow her heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=2158s) and urged the peasant to write a letter laying her feelings bare for Immerkind. Although the two agreed that marriage was perhaps too hasty, Bae fervently thanked Gonathon for her advice and promised to make good on the courage the knight had given her. Later, Gonathon would proofread the letter along with NinoIna, and the heartfelt and passionate feelings expressed in it moved the two to tears.

Gonathon’s next encounter with Bae would not be in person, but rather through [memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=6486s) obtained in Star Site: Chaos. From there, Gonathon learned that Bae was in fact a trickster Djinn capable of granting wishes. However, the clumsiness and foolishness showcased by the peasant-turned-genie in the memory did little to change Gonathon’s perception of her, and the knight continued to treat her as an equal and a friend.

Sadly, the knight and peasant’s next encounter would be far from pleasant, as Gonathon was drawn into the custody conflict between Bae, Shiori, and Bijou over the fate of the their child, Khaos. Following a protracted and bitter feud between the parties, they eventually agreed to share custody, with Gonathon joining the newly formed [State Farm family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alQr5XqoUPs&t=14038s). Thankfully the day would not end on a sour note, as Bae would request Gonathon’s assistance in her proposal to Immerkind. The gleeful knight eagerly agreed to wingman for Bae, and while the future remained murky for the two of them, they agreed to charge forth together.
