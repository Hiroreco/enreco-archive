Seemingly unfazed by the previous day’s chaos, Shiori started off her morning productively by helping others through the Star Site: Chronos dungeon. It was nice—being helpful, motivated, and untouched by drama… well, for a little while, anyway.

Inevitably, she got dragged into the madness. But more often than not, she played the role of a distant observer, silently watching the chaos unfold around her.

In the situations where she was actually involved, she often felt more like a background prop being shuffled around than a key player—take, for example, the convoluted tale involving her old child with Bijou, which spiraled into a full-on legal dispute (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:bae-bijou-bottom-1-bottom-2)).

She did make time to join the others for the new [Star Site: Chaos dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?t=7733) and even fought the Outlander—y’know, the actual main quest that somehow got buried under all the emotional wreckage.

At the very least, she ended the day with some quiet, meaningful moments spent with her new-slash-old romantic partner, and later penned it all down in her diary.
