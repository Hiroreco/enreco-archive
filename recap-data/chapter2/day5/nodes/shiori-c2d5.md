<!-- title: Shiori Nyavella -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Seemingly unfazed by the previous dayâ€™s chaos, Shiori started off her morning productively by helping others get through the Star Site: Chronos dungeon. It was niceâ€”being helpful, motivated, and untouched by drama... well, for a little while, anyway.

Inevitably, she got dragged into the madness. But more often than not, she played the role of a distant observer, silently watching the chaos unfold around her.

In the situations where she was involved, she often felt more like a background prop being shuffled around than a key playerâ€”take, for example, the convoluted tale involving her old child with Bijou, which spiraled into a full-on legal dispute (see [Bae-Bijou: Family Broken, Found, and Resolved](#edge:bae-bijou)).

She did make time to join the others for the new [Star Site: Chaos dungeon](https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?t=7733) and even fought the Outlanderâ€”you know, the actual main quest that somehow got buried under all the emotional wreckage.

Like the others, Shiori was then challenged by the Outlander to a duelâ€”a trial, more than a true battle. A test to determine whether the heroes were worthy of inheriting his role of destroying the Heart of Ruin and saving the world.

And in classic Shiori fashion, she took the opportunity to jab, tease, and prod. She mocked the Outlander, though at first, it seemed like her usual playful snark. But then, her tone shiftedâ€”less whimsical, more biting. Her words carried an odd weight, a hint of something deeper. She spoke not just to the Outlander but also to herself. About how they were alike.

Two people who _"watch over stories, and feel conflicted that they canâ€™t be part of them,"_ who _"break the rules often."_

They werenâ€™t throwaway lines. Not from someone who speaks as if they know more than they should. Not from someone who holds a role bigger than whatâ€™s visible on the surface.

What did she mean by that? Did it tie into her titleâ€”Archiver?

Later, when the Princess and the Outlander asked the heroes about their reason for saving the kingdom, the others gave answers that varied: confusion, pride, and profit. But Shioriâ€™s answer was different.

"I'm just doing my job, and being a dirty, horrible self-inserter like him."

"I'm fighting for my duty, because I am Shiori Nyavella."

Not for the world. Not for the people. Not even for herself. But for her _role_. A role she never clearly explained. A role she seemed to fully _know_, even if no one else did.

Self-inserter? Into what, exactly? A story? Was she hinting at something more... meta?

Maybe she was just being her strange, eccentric self. Or maybe, just maybe, Shiori Nyavella wasnâ€™t merely a witch with a pen and a sharp tongueâ€”but something far more.

Still, not everything had to be tangled in mystery. At least one of the questions had a charmingly down-to-earth answer: the mess of romance and rivalry sheâ€™d stumbled into. The Orange Knight, so humble, so earnest, had completely upended her world. Turned her story on its head. And now, she was left picking up the emotional debris of their ever-complicated dynamic (see [Shioriâ€“Gonathon](#edge:gigi-shiori)).

She ended her day with rare, quiet momentsâ€”sharing them with [Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?t=15814) and later, a bonding conversation with a sleepy Elizabeth. All of it, as always, inked into her diaryâ€”yet another page, yet another piece of the puzzle that was Shiori.
