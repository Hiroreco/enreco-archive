**(Archiver’s Note: This is a long read and there’s also a couple tough scenes. Reader discretion is advised.)**

Today was the day Princess Bijou wanted to set things straight.

She had awoken from the bed of her beloved. It was the first night of restful sleep she had in a span of four days; she either slept on the floor of her shop or collapsed (like that one time at the end of Day 2). 

She went back to her shop, where she found the story she commissioned from her dearly beloved! Hidden in a corner, [she read it out loud.](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=515)

It was only 10 pages long like she asked, but… it ended on a cliffhanger! She desperately wanted to see what would happen next. Luckily, Shiori just got on, so she was able to ask for a sequel then and there.

She also invited Shiori to go to Star Site: Chronos together, knowing her boss was absent yesterday and had yet to see it. Shiori had to get ~~dinner~~ breakfast first AND was anticipating some sort of meeting with the other Chefs in a few minutes, so they put a pin on that.

Speaking of her boss, Roa came back today after a well-deserved day off. Elizabeth, the Red Knight, came by the shop during this time and… it seems like [Roa had the hots for her?](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=3401) 

Bijou tried to push her towards making a move, and it seems like she did—although she made it anonymous. A secret admirer sort of situation. Whatever happened after that… wasn’t Bijou’s problem at that point.

----

After her revisit to Star Site: Chronos, [she called up Peasant Bae](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=7980), asking for materials for her shop as she ran out after serving Gonathan. This was how Bijou decided to bait her into trying to get Khaos back…

Veiled behind a regular business transaction, Bijou confronts the Peasant about the Stain hat on her head. She and Shiori had previously abandoned the baby back in the illusory Libestal, and now she wants it back.

(*NOTE: [Biboo clarified outside of RP](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=25370) that Khaos is the stain hat that Shiori wore last chapter. The stain hat that Bijou got corrupted by went away after she got purified.*)

Bae strongly believed she had been taking better care of Khaos since she found it; after all, Bae did the right thing to free them from the shackles of slavery. *(How it traveled back in time with the warriors is…not explained.)* 

[The hat is not for sale.](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=8082)

As if her Onii-chan and her sister openly eavesdropping on this wasn’t enough, Bijou tried getting Tam’s opinion on the matter. …It was too early for the queen to deal with it. The two will just have to settle it in therapy later.

That said, they would have to set their differences aside for the time being. It was time for Bijou to investigate Star Site: Chaos.

----

Little did she know that she would be asked to duel with none other than [The Outlander](#node:outlander) upon her return, as a test of her strength for what's to come.

They were transported to a [vaguely familiar place](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=11300) to fight. Bijou was victorious, winning on the first try. Somehow she could be reached by phone in that mysterious battlefield, but that didn't distract her from fighting.

The dialogue she had with the Princess and the Outlander after the duel had Bijou pause to think deeply for a moment. Although she was being asked about the fate of Libestal, she couldn’t just think of that when asked this one question:

[“What does Libestal mean to you?”](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=11473)

----

Bijou met with Gonathan at the Library after recovering [Fia’s](#node:fia) third memory fragment. [Gonathan soon asked for Bijou’s ear](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=11846) in regards to a serious matter.

Sat under a big tree far from everyone else’s buildings, he felt the need to confess about eavesdropping on the conversation she had with Bae earlier.

Gonathan realized how much Bijou likes Shiori. If there was anything he could do to help Bijou get the baby back, he was but one call away. (See [Bijou-Gonathan: Good Neighbors](#edge:gigi-bijou-left-3-left-3).) In response, she invited Gonathan to join her therapy session with Bae.

Bae was waiting at the wagon, now having reclaimed her memories as Hakos Baelz (she was still a peasant at heart). She postponed her therapy session until after she revisited Star Site: Chaos. With Bijou, Gonathan, and Ina, they tried winning the hidden music disc a second time.

They all failed the first time in their respective parties; Bijou’s party ended with 53% luck. In that second attempt, with a 9-in-10 chance, they were successful! 

They ran to the nearest jukebox to celebrate…to the Hot Pink One’s chagrin at first, as they went straight to *his* jukebox first.

That was the peak of Bijou’s happiness that day. The calm before the storm, if you will. The events that would later transpire would become traumatic to innocent Princess Bijou…

----

As she approached Shiori’s house, she saw Gonathan at her front door. She wanted to ask Shiori to come to couples’ therapy, but she innocently let him go inside and let the two talk things out first. She [hid inside the outhouse](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15243) to eavesdrop on them for a bit. Apparently Shiori had cooked a meal for Gonathan?!

At some point [she felt guilty](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15366) about eavesdropping. She didn’t wanna be blinded by jealousy and rage once again. Her trust in both of them stayed true. If they felt the need to talk things out, that’s their business. She even [called Bae](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15485), out of not having nobody else to turn to.

Bijou decided to postpone the therapy session a little bit longer. She wanted to see Shiori anyway. Feigning ignorance, she entered Shiori’s house. Gonathan appeared to be coming back in; he was wearing a Chef’s Touque.

Shiori was kind enough to let her in and feed her. The first thing Bijou brought up was the child, and what Shiori’s opinion on the matter was.

Shiori was very frank about her feelings. [If the child is happy, she’s willing to support from afar.](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15866) The best course of action seemed to just let Bae have the child… unless Bijou objects.

Bijou wasn’t entirely satisfied by this answer. She was pursuing this for Shiori’s sake. Her stance did not change, but… agreed to come to the therapy session.

In essence, this was now a family therapy session.

----

Alone, Bijou went to Mordan’s therapy shack to begin therapy. She stated her case, only for Bae to suddenly butt in and object. Shiori and Gonathan soon followed, and the court case truly began.

[Family Court](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=15988)

Gonathan was kind of just… there though. This was mainly an affair between Bijou, Shiori, and Bae. Gonathan looked confused almost the entire time and nay spoke a word… even though he paid to be there.

Nonetheless, there was a lot of yelling back and forth. Poor Princess Bijou felt overwhelmed by this entire exchange and emotions got the best of her. She couldn’t even see the fact that the Stain on Bae’s head [wasn’t actually her child!](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=16677) Bae  was also the mother of another child all along...

Mordan closed the case as follows: [Shiori](#node:shiori) can have visitation rights, but Bijou must offer child support. Bijou then brought up living space concerns, stating that the diamond-studded room in Bae’s hole was too small and thus inadequate.

While looking for an adequate living space for the child, Mordan began to lose her composure. She [talked under her breath](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17200) towards Shiori; they had a bad relationship from day one in Past Libestal. Unfortunately, everyone heard that and were all shook by this. Even Shiori—they were still in a therapy session!

The five of them tried to reconcile—which Bijou partially helped in by agreeing to pay for the [charges](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17403) put against her by Bae. “Call it child support”, said Shiori. 

All seemed to be well… but it somehow got worse. Overwhelmed in anger, Mordan ran away and left for the day. They were all out of a therapist.

Bijou felt the need to talk to Bae after the entire fiasco. [Things went out of hand](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17644) and they knew that. The better course of action is just to talk it out. As a family.

Shiori seemed to be off finding Gonathan again. Bae had let the children play in Shiori’s room for the time being. As part of their reconciliation, Bae mutually agreed to give Bijou visitation rights after all (alongside Shiori).

The two of them came back to Gonathon and Shiori, [reconciling](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=17898) as a group on their own terms. Mordan was now seen in a new light. Were her services biased after all? Whatever happened to impartiality? And what of privacy, for that matter?

Maybe they’ll seek different avenues of therapy the next day. That jeweler Mococo offers therapy sessions too, after all…

After all of that, Bijou asked where she stood with Shiori regarding their relationship. They mutually agreed to let Bae have the child, and Bae allowed them to visit whenever they pleased. All was well.

[…But what will come of the two of them?](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=18552)

----

As if the day was over, the two of them [wrote their daily journals](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=19395) together inside the therapist shack. But… the day’s tension was not over. 

As the two were about to submit their daily journals to the library, they walked into Tam and IRyS. The queen was confessing her love to IRyS. Bijou sees this all go down from a distance, not even thinking at first to go to her brother’s side.

Gonathan had also finished his daily journal around this time and walked in on this, only to get turned away by Shiori. No matter… Gonathon had seen enough. Shiori demanded Gonathan to sit in the therapy chair until they cleared out.

Shiori and Bijou returned to the inside of the library. She continued to distance herself from the matter, but… wait—IRyS is EXPECTING?! Hearing what Tam and IRyS were saying… the Princess started to spiral too.

["Is no person in this kingdom good?!"](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=20720)

To try bringing comedic relief to the situation, Bijou asks to make sure if it’s just gas she is feeling. Then again, if it was real, then maybe a [gender reveal party](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=20922) is to be called for. Shiori could easily provide for that.

Bijou had to speak to someone about this though. Now without a therapist, [Shiori lends both her and Gonathan her ear](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21122)—promising to be completely unbiased. Unlike that reaper/lorekeeper/tavern keeper guy…

This was mainly Gonathon’s time to speak his mind about what he felt. Bijou had also given her two cents on the matter, coming from her blood-pact relation to IRyS. She leaves Shiori and Gonathan alone after the latter leaves to go see where IRyS was.

----

***(content warning ahead)***

Bijou returned to doing her business when she noticed an [eerie, deafening silence](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21666). Only Elizabeth and Shiori were around in the Building Area. She thought of calling her brother to see what was up… [at the nick of time](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21724).

This was how Bijou found out that her brother was thinking of going away…... forever. She didn’t have the entire context for why—all she knew was that she had been berated. She rushed as fast as she could to go save her.

Based on what he said his location was, her instincts led her to the Antigonian Aerie. She loved her Onii-chan so much… so much that she would follow wherever he went. Even if it meant *diving off a cliff right next to him.*

[The Goddess is descending.](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21847)

Gonathon and Tam jumped off with them. While they survived the fall, IRyS and Bijou both perished…

…*"in Minecraft."* 

The blood-pact brothers respawned on the warp point, seemingly given a second chance.

IRyS’ pain subsided briefly, but it came back. Is the baby… still there? IRyS believes so; she’s a goddess, after all. But could the baby be an eldritch being, a demi-god, or both? Or is it just food after all? *Only time will tell.* They still plan to surprise her consort (Ina) with the news the next day.

----

After this traumatic experience, she [meets with Shiori again](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=22527) to talk about the circumstances for the gender reveal party. After the absolute chaos that ensued that day, they sat on the front porch of the house next to the wagon. Elizabeth was there as well. It’s at this moment when Princess Bijou, ever innocent, asked the Red Knight…

["Do you think there are truly good people in this world?"](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=22748)

They also spent some time gossiping about the lore of the kingdom so far before heading out. Bijou listened to Elizabeth’s answer to her question in earnest, but… she wasn’t convinced.

She already turned in her journal; her thoughts have not changed. She needs some time to think about it. To see if her words were true. Her world view had turned more cynical after today.

She does admit, at least, that she needed that talk with the Red Knight. She needed that moment looking up in the sky, and to the buildings in front of them. It eased her mind at least a little.

Despite her rock-hard appearance, today proved our Princess Bijou had a soft, emotional core prone to crumbling in the face of drama. She wonders if she could handle existing in this universe.

*"We will have to see what tomorrow brings."*

She went to bed with her dearly beloved that night.
