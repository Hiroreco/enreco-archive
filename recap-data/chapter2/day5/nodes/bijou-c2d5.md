Today was the day Princess Bijou wanted to set things straight.

She had awoken from the bed of her beloved. It was the first night of restful sleep she had in four days; she either slept on the floor of her shop or collapsed (like that one time at the end of Day 2).

She went back to her shop, where she found the story she commissioned from her dearly beloved! Hidden in a corner, she read it out loud.

It was only 10 pages long like she asked, but… it ended on a cliffhanger! She desperately wanted to see what would happen next. Luckily, Shiori just got on, so she was able to ask for a sequel then and there.

The gem then met up with her boss, Roa, who seemed to [have the hots for a certain Scarlet Knight?](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=3401)

Bijou tried to push her towards making a move, and it seems like she did—although she made it anonymous, a secret admirer sort of situation. Whatever happened after that wasn’t Bijou’s problem at that point.

After her revisit to Star Site: Chronos, [she called up Peasant Bae](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=7980), asking for materials for her shop, as she ran out after serving Gonathon. This was how Bijou decided to bait her into trying to get Khaos back…

Veiled behind a regular business transaction, Bijou confronts the Peasant about the Stain hat on her head. She and Shiori had previously abandoned the baby back in the illusory Libestal, and now she wants it back.

Bae strongly believed she had been taking better care of Khaos since she found it; after all, Bae did the right thing to free them from the shackles of slavery (see [Bijou-Bae](#edge:bae-bijou)). _(How it traveled back in time with the warriors was never explained.)_

That said, they would have to set their differences aside for the time being. It was time for Bijou to investigate Star Site: Chaos, and later, a duel with [the Outlander](#node:outlander).

The dialogue she had with the Princess and the Outlander after the duel had Bijou pause to think deeply for a moment. Although she was being asked about the fate of Libestal, she couldn’t just think of that when asked this one question:

Fast-forwarding to the end of the day, after one hectic therapy session later, Bijou and Shiori decided to cool down by [writing their daily journals](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=19395) together inside the therapy shack. But the day’s tension was not over.

As the two were about to submit their daily journals to the Library, they walked into Tam and IRyS. The queen was confessing her love to IRyS. Bijou sees this all go down from a distance, not even thinking at first to go to her brother’s side.

And then, broke the news. IRyS... was EXPECTING?! Hearing what Tam and IRyS were saying the Princess started to spiral too.

To try to bring comedic relief to the situation, Bijou asks if it’s just gas she is feeling. Then again, if it was real, maybe a [gender reveal party](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=20922) was in order. Shiori could easily provide for that.

Bijou had to speak to someone about this. Though now without a therapist, [Shiori lends both her and Gonathon her ear](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21122)—promising to be completely unbiased. Unlike that reaper/lorekeeper/tavern keeper.

This was mainly Gonathon’s time to speak his mind about what he felt. Bijou had also given her two cents on the matter, coming from her blood-pact relation to IRyS. She leaves Shiori and Gonathon alone after the latter leaves to go see where IRyS is.

Bijou returned to doing her business when she noticed an [eerie, deafening silence](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21666). Only Elizabeth and Shiori were around in the building area. She thought of calling her brother to see what was up… [just in the nick of time](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=21724).

This was how Bijou found out that her brother was thinking of going away… forever. She didn’t have the entire context for why—all she knew was that she had been berated. She rushed as fast as she could to go save her.

Based on what she said her location was, her instincts led her to the Antigonian Aerie. She loved her Onii-chan so much… so much that she would follow wherever she went. Even if it meant _diving off a cliff right next to her._

Gonathon and Tam jumped off with them. While they survived the fall, IRyS and Bijou both perished for a brief moment.

The blood-pact brothers respawned on the warp point, seemingly given a second chance.

IRyS’ pain subsided briefly, but it came back. Is the baby… still there? IRyS believes so; she’s a goddess, after all. But could the baby be an eldritch being, a demigod, or both? Or is it just food after all? _Only time will tell._ They still plan to surprise her consort (Ina) with the news the next day.

After this traumatic experience, she [meets with Shiori again](https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=22527) to talk about the circumstances of the gender reveal party. After the absolute chaos that ensued that day, they sat on the front porch of the house next to the wagon. Elizabeth was there as well. It’s at this moment when Princess Bijou, ever innocent, asked the Red Knight…

["Are truly good people in this world?"](#embed:https://youtu.be/AwTYvoyB3Xo?t=22748)

They also spent some time gossiping about the lore of the kingdom so far before heading out. Bijou listened to Elizabeth’s answer to her question in earnest, but she wasn’t convinced.

She had already turned in her journal; her thoughts had not changed. She needs some time to think about it. To see if her words were true. Her worldview had turned more cynical after today.

She does admit, at least, that she needed that talk with the Red Knight. She needed that moment to look up in the sky and at the buildings in front of them. It eased her mind at least a little.

Despite her rock-hard appearance, today proved our Princess Bijou had a soft, emotional core prone to crumbling in the face of drama. She wonders if she could handle existing in this universe.

_"We will have to see what tomorrow brings."_

She went to bed with her dearly beloved that night.
