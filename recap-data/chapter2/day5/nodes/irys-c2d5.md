IRyS joined the day and got straight into preparing for the day’s task. One of which was tackling the day’s dungeon—but before that, she received an invitation to join the [Chef Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=1300s), led by none other than Mordan Ramsey.

Soon after, she got swept into a drama involving Bijou, where they discovered that the former child of Bijou and Shiori was actually the [mysterious Stain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=1808s) atop Bae’s head.

Then she teamed up with Tammy, Bae, and Ina to challenge the Star Site: Chaos, where together they managed to recover memories of [Hakos Baelz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=3568s).

After that, it was back to preparation for the next dungeon—getting stronger, getting ready. During this time, she stumbled across her lover, Tammy, who was whimpering after losing a hefty sum to the store Gacharm. And right after, she ran into the store’s owner, and the two had their "usual exchange." These two back-to-back encounters laid the groundwork for yet another drama in the kingdom, with the pink woman somehow ending up thinking she might be pregnant (see [IRyS-Kronii: Abdomen Pain](#edge:irys-kronii)).

She then appointed Gonathon as her loyal dog, after witnessing just how loyal—and frankly, how doglike—he was (see [IRyS-Gonathon: No Goddesses or Queens, only Grems](#edge:irys-gigi)).

And once all the chaos had passed, she ended her day [journaling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyN7jwsiiXA&t=17165s) about it all.
