Tam kicked off her day by diving headfirst into the Star Site: Chaos dungeon alongside the Hot Pink One, Nino Ina, and Peasant the Bae. There, they uncovered Bae's lost memories—turns out, she was more than just some quirky [peasant girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PukMnVXnJMo&t=2307s). Afterward, Tam was challenged by the Outlander himself. It was a challenge, alright, with the Outlander easily wiping the floor with her regal robes as Queen Tam was put in the dirt over and over due to her weak equipment.

This prompted the Queen to get better charms for herself, but in true Queen Tam fashion, she just had to [overcomplicate things](https://youtu.be/PukMnVXnJMo?t=3165). It wasn't even about not having the money for the "Gacharms"—she had some coins. She just wanted to appear special, maybe even getting a discount from the shop.

And so, using her newly regained memories to her unfair advantage, the Queen did the unthinkable and told Roa Pandora of their shared romantic history from the previous timeline and used the lingering [romantic feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PukMnVXnJMo&t=3653s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH) to con the poor big cat into giving her free charms. Even as she agonized over the monster she had become, the deed was done. All she could do was defeat the Outlander to somehow make up for it.

The plot thickened when Roa, Queen Tam, and the Hot Pink One (yes, the very same one Queen Tam began having a secret affair with the other day—and who just so happens to be Roa’s master, as Roa was her pet) decided to [team up for the day’s dungeon](https://youtu.be/PukMnVXnJMo?t=5771) again in search of treasure. The Queen was quite literally playing a dangerous game by juggling two women at the same time.

It went about as well as you’d expect: chaotic, emotionally confusing, and infinitely frustrating, as they were forced to do the dungeon over and over due to failing to acquire the treasure in it, which required a certain amount of luck, and all while leaving a trail of drama in its wake (see [Roa-Kronii](#edge:kronii-raora)).

Above all else, the humiliation that befell the Queen on this day reached heights—or depths—that even shook her own Humble Knight, Gonathon (see [Gigi-Kronii](#edge:kronii-gigi)).

Before the day could properly end, the ongoing drama with the Hot Pink One escalated to the point of her jumping off a cliffside, even as Queen Tam, Gonathon, and Bijou tried to stop her from doing so (see [Kronii-IRyS: Abdomen Pain](#edge:irys-kronii)).

With that, the day ended as the Queen finished writing her [journal of woes](https://youtu.be/PukMnVXnJMo?t=16515).
