Tam kicked off her day by diving headfirst into the Star Site: Chaos dungeon alongside IRyS, Ina, and Bae. There, they uncovered lost memories of Bae—turns out, she was more than just some quirky [peasant girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PukMnVXnJMo&t=2307s). Afterward, Tam was challenged by the Outlander himself. She got knocked around a few times, sure, but eventually pulled through and emerged victorious.

Then—and this is where things took a sharp turn—she met Roa. Somehow, seemingly out of nowhere, Tam found herself catching [romantic feelings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PukMnVXnJMo&t=3653s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH) for her, likely stirred up from unresolved moments in the past. The plot thickened when Roa, Tam, and the hot pink lady (yes, the very same one Tam also had lingering feelings for—and who just so happens to be Roa’s master, as Roa was her pet) decided to team up for the day’s dungeon again in search of treasure.

It went about as well as you’d expect: chaotic, emotionally confusing, and leaving a trail of drama in its wake (see [Roa-Kronii: That one Time the Queen was Sent To Another World and is Now Suddenly a Maid for a Goddess and Cat](#edge:kronii-raora) and [Kronii-IRyS: Abdomen Pain](#edge:irys-kronii)).

At the end of the day, Tammy wrapped it all up the best way she knew how—writing in her journal after casually inflicting mental damage on everyone involved. Teehee~
