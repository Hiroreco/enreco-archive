Another piece of Fia's memory resurfaced—perhaps the final fragment. But rather than tying all the threads together, this revelation only unraveled more.

[The Princess' Doll](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/98bQ3awzWLM?si=8VkaP1-inxJZVfpp&t=9357)

This memory was quiet. Personal. The Princess’s favorite doll, a gift from her mother, the Queen. A doll meant to watch over her, to protect her when no one else could. The Queen had been gentle, wise, and endlessly kind—a beacon of peace amidst growing chaos.

And yet, even she couldn’t escape the tragedy caused by the Ruination.

Possessed by the corruption hidden within a seemingly harmless hairpin, the Queen’s own handmaiden turned against her. Driven mad, the handmaiden committed the unthinkable: regicide. It happened in an instant, yet painfully long enough for the young Princess to bear witness to the murder of her mother.

"Nothing stays pure," the handmaiden had murmured again and again, her voice empty, as if repeating a truth too ancient and cruel to be denied. She was swiftly dealt with, but the damage was irreversible.

Later, as the corruption continued to spread and the King prepared for war, the Princess entrusted him with her doll—perhaps believing in its protective magic, perhaps simply hoping it would keep him close to her in spirit. But the King, too, never returned.

The doll never came back either.

And just like that, the Princess was left alone—an orphan in a crumbling kingdom.

When these memories returned to Fia, she merely bowed her head, thanked the heroes for helping her recover what was lost, and quietly let them continue on their way.

No grand realization—only silence.

And in that silence, more questions than answers.
