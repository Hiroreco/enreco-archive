Last dungeon down, the last fragment of Fia's memory was acquired. 

Oddly enough, Fia already recalls everything about the Outsider's origins. What could this last fragment hold?

The last fragment reveals... the Princess's favorite doll?

The last fragment also tells of the kind queen of the kingdom: gentle, wise, and always had something kind to say to everyone. 

Tragically, she was murdered by her handmaiden. Possessed by the corruption hidden in the hairpin, the handmaiden was driven to commit this act of regicide until Kopis was able to kill her.

All while the Princess witnessed the scene unfolding, frozen with fear.

Later when the King went to wage war with the spreading corruption, the Princess gave the King her doll as protection. However, the King failed to return from his war against the corruption.

Thus the Princess, now reduced an orphan.
