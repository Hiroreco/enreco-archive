**What Does It Mean to be a Knight?**

The previous day’s events had left Gonathon G a broken and deeply troubled knight. However, as the sun rose on a new day, Gonathon was resolute in her desire to seek redemption and improve.

First, Gonathon paid a visit to her therapist Mordan Ramsey, whom she had desperately petitioned for aid the night before (see [Calli-Gonathon: Confidently Confidential](#edge:calli-gigi)). Beginning their session in earnest, Mordan implored the knight to fight for her own beliefs and code, rather than blindly following the wishes of others. She further told a [love story](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=964) between a maiden and knight, one that was deeply familiar to Gonathon (and was in fact one of her and her Pearl.)

Gonathon’s travels that day would see her lending aid to many people, including those she had every right to see as rivals or foes. For Princess Bijou (see [Bijou-Gonathon: Good Neighbors](#edge:gigi-bijou)), the one who was now betrothed to her former love Shiori, the humble knight apologized for using Shiori to fill the hole in her heart left by her Pearl, and the two promised to always help one another. And for Bae the Peasant (see [Bae-Gonathon: A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed](#edge:bae-gigi)), who Gonathon had feared was corrupted and threatening the land, Gonathon gave her the courage to confess to Immerkind, seeking to make right the error she had committed in shackling Immerkind’s heart to the Princess. Even the Hot Pink One, who perhaps most of all was undeserving of any generosity, the humble knight swore to serve as a loyal guard dog, although this would prove to be a troublesome arrangement in due time.

Soon after, Gonathon joined up with the Wolf Pack to tackle the next dungeon. Here Gonathon had a heart-to-heart with Shakira that saw the wily phoenix consoling Gonathon on her personal strife and arranging for Mordan to groom the scruffy knight. Free of fleas and full of determination, Gonathon fought alongside the Pack in Star Site: Chaos, besting its games of chance and ferocious Stain King. Following a revelation of Bae’s true identity, Gonathon found herself face to face with an all too familiar person: the Outlander.

An intense duel saw Gonathon emerge victorious once more, and a flood of memories return. When asked why she fought and what Libestal meant to her, Gonathon [responded resoundingly](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=7383): from now on, she would not fight simply because she was told or because of blind duty, but because it was what she believed in. For her, Libestal meant kindness, compassion, and above all always fighting for what you believed in.

Following this, Gonathon met with the aloof, but deeply familiar Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame (see [Elizabeth-Gonathon: Honor and Justice](#edge:liz-gigi)). As a fellow knight, Liz had become deeply concerned with Gonathon’s dealings with Shiori. She too asked Gonathon what she was fighting for, and after being asked what she thought of Gonathon, the scarlet knight described the [deep kinship](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=10855) she felt for Gonathon, Immerkind, and Roa. The two agreed they shared a special bond, and resolved to fight for an even higher cause than mere honor or love: that of Justice. Filled with resolve, Gonathon went forth to confront her greatest challenge of the day: reconciling with Shiori Nyavella.

The [reunion of the diamond and black pearl](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=11506) proved bittersweet. Shiori lamented Gonathon’s flaws, both past and present. Yet despite all Gonathon had done wrong, Shiori assured the knight that while she was indeed a fool, she had a good heart. It was this good heart that was on display as, during an intense couple’s therapy session and child custody battle between Bae and Shiori and Bijou, Gonathon would assist in smoothing out the difficulties they shared, even promising to provide monetary support to the child. The new family, dubbed State Farm, parted on happy terms and, following a final heart to heart with Mordan in which she provided career advice to her former therapist, Gonathon prepared to turn in for the night.

But her most grueling trial was yet to come, for yet another figure needed Gonathon’s aid: her beloved queen, Tam Gandr (see [Gonathon-Kronii: The Sham Queen’s Sacrifice](#edge:kronii-gigi)). Tam had become enslaved by the deviant HPO, and had fallen into a pit of despair not unlike that which Gonathon had experienced the previous day. [Enraged](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=15494) that her queen would be treated this way, Gonathon implored Tam to stand up for herself and demand the respect she was owed as a monarch. The queen was moved to tears, thanking Gonathon for always standing with her, even at her lowest. Sadly, the HPO arrived before Tam could be properly steeled, and Gonathon was forced to flee in tears as Tam fell to the foul goddess’s mercy.

Unwilling to abandon her queen and treasured friend, Gonathon charged back into the fray, only to find that Tam had heeded her advice and laid low the degenerate pink creature. After foiling an attempt by HPO to escape her responsibility, Gonathon and Tam had a [bewildering heart to heart](https://youtu.be/alQr5XqoUPs?t=18669) in which the knight convinced the queen to seek a more equal role in the relationship…and expanded cat kissing rights. Thus Gonathon’s first steps to redemption came to an end, and while the knight still has much work to do, she resolved to stay optimistic and hold her head high.
