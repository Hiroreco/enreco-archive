There was an apprehensive sense of foreboding. Was it the air? The child on Bae's head? Inside her? Wherever it was from, it didn't stop the visions, snapshots of a [blurry face in her dreams.](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=824)

But visions of what could be Bae's past weren't the only thing troubling her. There was also love... and Gonathon's rather messy relationship. Bae called him to her PP Hole, concerned about his well-being after yesterday's _bombastic_ events. Glad to hear he was fine, she asked for his love advice. Bae was but a peasant, dumb (and poor) in many ways but especially in matters of the heart. A lesson her Mother never finished, but the heart didn't heed what the brain thought, stirring whenever she met the lovely Immerkind... And _anguish_ as Bae knows she wasn't the green apple of Immerkind's green eyes.

Immerkind's love for Princess Iphania was too well-known and worrisome for Bae to be ignorant. How could a peasant, in name, compare to royalty? Gonathon would give sound advice, reminding Bae that she had cared for Cecilia when she was in pain and that as heroes of another land, they must leave once evil had been defeated. That Cecilia's love may be fraught with inevitable heartbreak. Bae may still have a chance. A chance that a heartfelt letter may sway Cecilia's own heart.

Rings were too soon, but flowers gave the 'right' touch of Bae's intention. The price, Bae faltered for a moment, but her love for Cecilia couldn't be measured by gold spent (gold that would be earned back after a certain therapist-chef commissioned Bae for a pickaxe). But another worry crept in: what [comes after today's Dungeon?](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2262) If Peasant The Bae's memories returned; would her feelings stay the same? To preserve her feelings, Bae wrote her a letter first:

[Dearest ImmerKind...](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2543)

[Read "My confession"](#text:my-confession)

Words flowed out like a steady river from Bae's quill, passion burning itself onto the parchment. Each feeling is transcribed carefully and precisely, hoping that the Fair Maiden can hear Bae's sincerity and ardent love. After being [proofread by others](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3130), the Hot Pink One notwithstanding her rating of 6/10, it was ready.

Unbeknownst to Bae, there was another familial matter at hand. Bijou called; at first it seemed to be about enigmatic stones to be negotiated in person, but as they talked in Bae's PP Hole...

[The 'hat' on Bae's head was her and Shiori's child, Khaos.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3580)

Bijou told Bae about her past, her mistakes, and Shiori's struggles to care for Khaos alone. The child was abandoned because of Bijou, and thus, [Bijou asked Bae to return Khaos to her so she can set things right](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3620), to their audience's shock and Bae's disgust. Righteous anger filled Bae as she denied Bijou's request. **Bae** was the one who stepped up for Khaos when no one would and cared for Khaos when no one did. Tensions were high, but it was a matter to be solved later.

Star Site: Chaos. The new dungeon **spoke** to Bae. There was an [overwhelming sense of familiarity with each challenge](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=4434). Each game was _beautifully chaotic_, with no need for challenging puzzles, math questions, or overwhelming might. Just a little luck on the roll of a die. However, she had to reroll later to get that disk.

[**WAAAAZZZZUUUUUPPPP**](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSFZwinYaaU)

Bae wasn't a peasantâ€”she helped out _peasants_, like Charlie! That brat. Bae remembers now; he took her dice after all the help she gave him! And it's now lost! So, Bae _still_ was missing her full power. But, despite her newly found identity as Chaos, Bae couldn't let go of the Peasant title... keeping it [in Charlie's honor.](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=5680)

But all is not over, for there are a few more challenges. First, the Outlander. Bae must prove that she is [the hero this world needs](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6108) and overturn fate. A battle well fought and well won.

Second, there were Bae's memories. [Who was Mother](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6505) if Bae ever had one. Bae can remember Charlie fondly, reminiscing about the times they spent as she worked, but not a 'Mother'. Was perhaps, Mother... Brother? Was 'Brother' Charlie? It almost felt like the memories in Bae's head were in too much conflict for her to truly understand.

But it wasn't just Bae who was troubled, since a distressed Bijou soon called for help; [Bijou's beloved, Shiori, and Gonathon were talking once again](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=10880). Caught between trusting her wife and repeating her mistake, Bijou turned to Bae for advice. Despite the tensions earlier in the day, Bae still held Bijou as a friend. She told her to trust Shiori and that they could begin the custody battle/family therapy session with Mordan soon.

[**_The dispute was... a Mess_**](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11850).

It was one filled with drama, tears, and deceit that soap operas can only dream of having. Inspired by a suggestion from Mordan, [Bae bought another hat/child](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11383) and [renamed the real Khaos](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11464) to test Bijou. A ploy that [Bijou fell for](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=12085), proving that Bae deserved primary custody. Not that anybody disagreed. But alas, the subject of home suitability came up, and, in an unexpected twist, Mordan's tavern seemed like the top choice for the children's home. A home that was accepted then dropped when everyone, except Gonathon, turned on Mordan after they mistakenly thought the chef insulted the group (it was only Shiori).

Tired and wary, [Bijou and Bae finally made amends](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13039h). As they watched the children play in Shiori's humble shack, they agreed that they went too far and that therapy doesn't really work. Bae gave her blessing for Bijou and Shiori to visit Khaos. Gonathon would step up to help [provide for the child as well.](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13387) Bae would also need to build the children's room, but that is a task for another day.

[Oh, and Bae is also mother to another child.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13027)

But another matter lingered in Bae's mind: Cecilia Immerkind. As a worried Gonathon pulled her away to talk, Bae explained that some of her memories might be linked to her missing box. But her focus right now was the Kind Knight. Bae would give the letter [to Cecilia](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13807) in person and present her with flowers afterwards. Touched, Gonathon promised to help Bae when the moment arrived.
