There was an apprehensive sense of foreboding. Was it the air? The child on Bae's head? Inside her? Wherever it's from did not stop the visions, snapshots of a [blurry face in her dreams.](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=824)

But visions of what could be Bae's past weren't the only thing troubling her. Love... and Gonathan's rather messy relationship. Bae called him to her PP Hole, concerned about his well-being after yesterday's _bombastic_ events. Glad to hear he was fine, she asked for his advice on love. Bae was but a peasant, dumb (and poor) in many ways but especially in the matters of the heart. A lesson her Mother never finished, but the heart didn't care for what the brain thought, stirring whenever she met the lovely Immerkind... And _anguish_ as Bae knows she wassn't the green apple of Immerkind's green eyes.

[Immerkind's love for the Princess Iphania](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=1388) was too well-known, and worrisome, for Bae to be ignorant. How could a peasant, in name, compare to royalty? Gonathan would give sound advice reminding Bae that she had cared for Cecilia when she was in pain and that as heroes of another land, they must leave once evil had been defeated. That Cecilia's love may be fraught with inevitable heartbreak. Bae may still have a chance. A chance that a heartfelt letter may sway Cecilia's own heart.

With a gift. Rings were too soon but flowers gave the 'right' touch of Bae's intention. The price, Bae faltered for a moment but her love for Cecilia couldn't be measured by gold spent (gold that would be earned back after a certain therapist-chef commissioned Bae for a pickaxe). But, another worry crept in: what [comes after today's Dungeon?](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2262) If Peasant The Bae's memories returned, would her feelings stay the same? To preserve her feelings, Bae wrote her letter first:

[Dearest ImmerKind...](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2543)

Words flowed out like a steady river from Bae's quill, passion burning itself onto the parchment. Each feeling transcribed carefully, precisely, hoping that the Fair Maiden can hear Bae's sincerity and ardent love. After being [proofread by others](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3130), the Hot Pink One's notwithstanding by her rating of 6/10, it was ready.

Unbeknownst to Bae, there was another familial matter at hand. Bijou called, at first it seemed to be about Enigmatic stones to be negotiated in-person but as they talked in Bae's PP Hole...

[The 'hat' on Bae's head was her's and Shiori's child, Khaos.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3580)

Bijou told Bae her past, her mistakes, and of Shiori's struggles to care for Khaos alone. The child was abandoned because of Bijou, and thus, [Bijou asked Bae to return Khaos to her so she can set things right](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3620), to their audience's shock and Bae's disgust. Righteous anger filled Bae as she denied Bijou's request. **Bae** was the one who stepped up for Khaos when no one would, and cared for Khaos when no one did. Tensions were high but it was a matter to be solved later.

Star Site: Chaos. The new dungeon **spoke** to Bae. There was an [overwhelming sense of familiarity with each challenge](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=4434). Each game was _beautifully chaotic_, no need for challenging puzzles or math questions or overwhelming might. Just a little luck on the roll of a die. Though she had to reroll later to get that disk.

Bae wasn't a peasant - she helped out _peasants_, like Charlie! That brat. Bae remembers now, he took her dice after all the help she gave him! And it's now lost! So, Bae's _still_ locked out of her full powers. But, despite her newly found identity as Chaos, Bae couldn't let go of the Peasant title... keeping it [in Charlie's honour.](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=5680)

But all is not over for there are a few more challenges. First, the Outlander. Bae must prove that she is [the hero this world needs](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6108) and overturn fate. A battle well fought and well won.

Second, were Bae's memories. [Who was Mother](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6505) if Bae never had one. Bae can remember Charlie fondly, reminiscing the times they spent as she worked, but not a 'Mother'. Was perhaps Mother... Brother? Was 'Brother' Charlie? It almost felt like the memories in Bae's head were too in too much conflict for her to truly understand.

But it wasn't just Bae who was troubled since a distressed Bijou soon called for help; [Bijou's beloved, Shiori, and Gonathan were talking once again](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=10880). Caught between trusting her wife and repeating her mistake, Bijou turned to Bae for advice. Despite the tensions earlier in the day, Bae still held Bijou as a friend. She told her to trust Shiori and that they can begin the custody battle/family therapy session with Mori soon.

[**_The dispute... for a the lack of a better word was a Mess_**](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11850).

It was one filled with drama, tears, and deceit that soap operas can only dream of having. Inspired by a suggestion from Mordan, [Bae bought another hat/child](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11383) and [renamed the real Khaos](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11464) to test her opposition. A ploy that [Bijou fell for](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=12085), proving that Bae deserved primary custody. Not that anybody really disagreed. But alas, the subject of home suitability came up and, in an unexpected twist, Mordan's tavern seemed like the top choice for the children's home. A home that was accepted then dropped when everyone, except Gonathan, turned on Mordan after they mistakenly thought the chef insulted the group (it was only Shiori).

Tired and wary, [Bijou and Bae finally made ammends](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13039h). As they watched the childen play in Shiori's humble shack, they agreed that they went too far and that therapy doesn't really work. Bae gave her blessing for Bijou and Shiori to visit Khaos and Gonathan would step up to help [provide for the child as well.](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13387) Bae would also need to build the children's room but that is task for another day.

[Oh and Bae is also Mother to another child.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13027)

But another matter lingered in Bae's mind: Cecilia Immerkind. As a worried Gonathan pulled her away to talk, Bae explained that some of her memories might be linked to her missing box. But her focus right now was the kind knight. Bae would give the letter [to Cecilia](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13807) in person and present her with flowers afterwards. Touched, Gonathan promised to help Bae when moment arrives.
