"Something is... *stirring*," The Peasant The Bae thought. From where, she couldn't say. The child that is on her head? Inside her? Perhaps it is that. Visions, snapshots of a [face she almost grasped](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=824) but slipped through her fingers. Today would be a special one.

That is not the only thing Bae worried about. She called Gonathan to her PP Hole, to inquire about his well-being from yesterday's rather dramatic (love) affair and to ask for his advice. To Bae's relief, Gonathan seemed to be doing better and she would open her own heart: She is but a peasant, dumb (and poor) in many ways but especially in the matters of the heart. Her Mother never finished this lesson but ignorance did not stop her heart from stirring whenever she met the kind Immerkind.

Bae felt anguish as she knew [Immerkind's love for the Princess Iphania](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=1388), for how could a peasant, even one with more money, compare to royalty? Is this love?  Confused, Bae asked Gonathan for his advice. Gonathan hesitated, his own endeavour with love had proven... Complicated (See Gonathan's relationships), but, reminded Bae that she was there for Immerkind when others were not. Perhaps write a letter, he suggested, so Immerkind may read Bae's true feelings once she returns?

Gonathan brought up another point Bae hadn't consider: They are heroes of another land. Once their adventure is over, they *must* leave Libestal. What of Immerkind's heart then, when she would have to part ways with the Princess. Realising that perhaps that a lowly peasant might have a chance, Bae quickly took his advice and began fretting on what to write in her letter. Gonathan advised Bae to write what she told him, for what her heart spoke is what she felt and that is enough. A gift too wouldn't be a bad idea.

[A letter and A 5000 gold Bouquet](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=1762)

Empowered, Bae quickly bought a letter to send but pondered on the gift. A ring, especially an expensive one, might prove too much, too soon. Flowers are a better option but which one? Bae faltered. 5000 gold for a bouquet of roses? Bae's love for Immerkind overcame her newly found appreciation for money and she bought the bouquet, swearing to swiftly earn the money back which came rather quick when Mordan Ramsey called Bae to commission a diamond pickaxe for 4000 gold.

Still, Bae worried for what [comes after the Dungeon](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=2262). The trepidatious feelings came back. Tammy once kind is now a Tyrant Queen calling them all 'peasants'. If Peasant The Bae's memories returned, would her feelings stay the same? It was letter best written before the adventure, to preserve her feelings on paper.

Her passion and love for Immerkind burnt like a thousand suns as she tenderly wrote on the parchment. Words flowed out like a steady river but soon found itself overflowing into the ocean as droplets of water flew into the sky like stars. Soon, the letter was done but was it good enough? She asked Gonathan and a few others to proofread the letter and was [gladdened by the positive reception](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3130), the Hot Pink One's notwithstanding by her rating of 6/10. 

Things are looking up, her letter approved and roses ready, when Bijou called. She first inquired about purchasing Enigmatic Stones and would quickly ask if they can negotiate in-person. Bae quickly agreed but then would come to slightly regret that decision; In the PP hole, Bijou revealed she remembered her past memories and... 

[The 'hat' on Bae's head is her's and Shiori's child, Khaos.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3580)

Bijou would quickly explain her past, her mistake, and of Shiori's inability to care for Khaos alone led to the child being abandoned before being picked up by Bae and then [ultimately asking for Khaos back to make amends with Shiori](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=3620), to Ina's and the Hot Pink One's shock and Bae's disgust. Anger coursed through Bae as she told Bijou how she found Khaos alone, how **she** was the one who truly cared for her when no one else was there. This conversation would ultimately turn to Mordan's therapy since there is not Court available for the heroes to use.

... After conquering the next dungeon, Star Site: Chaos. A dungeon that... **spoke** to Bae. There was an [overwhelming sense of familiarity with each challenge](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=4434). Each game was *beautifully chaotic*. There was no need for challenging puzzles or math questions, no need to prove your overwhelming might. Just enough luck to get a nice roll on a die.

[**WAAAAZZZZUUUUUPPPP**](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSFZwinYaaU)

Bae wasn't a peasant - she helped out *peasants*, like Charlie! That brat, he took her dice and she can't really use her full powers now. Bae might need therapy later since there was much to unpack. But, despite her newly found identity, Bae would still be a [Peasant in Charlie's honour!](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=5680) 

But all is not over, the Outlander found the source of Ruination in the Heart of the Ruins and then soon found out that unfortunate fate that will befall him if saves the world. He doubted her strength but Bae proved [her strength is more than enough to take his place](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6108). Another tender moment would be had as [Bae witnessed Fia's final memory return to her](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6316).

The adventure might be done but Bae's day isn't over as she completed Mordan's request for a diamond pickaxe, quickly calling the Chef for her services as a therapist for the family dispute. Bae would wistfully remember Charlie as she worked, remembering memories from long ago. [But, then who was Mother?](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=6505). Was Mother real? Or was perhaps Mother... Brother? Was 'Brother' Charlie? Bae couldn't understand why her memories were so conflicted.

A feeling that would ironically be mirrored in Bijou as the princess would call Bae for help; [Shiori, Bijou's beloved, and Gonathan were talking once again](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=10880) and Bijou must respect their privacy. Her distrust of Shiori in the past had led to her mistakes, ones that must not be repeated. Though the custody of Khaos was still in dispute, Bae was still Bijou's friend and loyal customer, receiving splendid charms earlier, and affirmed that Bijou should trust Shiori. Seeing that Bijou was still in conflict, Bae immediately suggested to counselling since Mordan's free.

Bae would quickly go to Mordan's therapy and had a brief solo therapy. After explaining her side of the story, including the spicy drama of the current state of the Shiori-Bijou relationship, Mordan would explain her idea: to trick the couple with a fake child. Bae disagreed Bijou would be tricked but had another idea. [She bought another hat/child](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11383) and [renamed the real Khaos](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11464). A ploy that [Bijou fell for.](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=12085)

[***The dispute... for a the lack of a better word was a Mess***](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=11850). 

The matter of primary custody go to Bae's favour with visitation rights given to Shiori. Bijou would waived all her rights as parental rights to Khaos and Gonathan would step up to support the child, despite being an outsider to this family dispute, and all of the party involved, minus the Good Knight Gonathan for he is still part of Mordan's Pack and too kind, would turn and blame the innocent Tavern-owning Therapist Chef for their heated dispute.

[Bae is also Mother to another child.](#embed:https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13027)

Bijou and Bae would make [amends in Shiori's shack](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13039) and admit they are all family now as Khaos played by the carpet and the second child playing by the bed. Expressing they all want everyone to be happy. Bae giving her blessing for Bijou to visit Khaos from time to time. The same offer of visitation would also be extended for Shiori. Gonathan was there as well and so was included and [would pay for child support](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13387).

Gonathan would pull Bae away to talk to her privately in the PP hole where Bae would explain that perhaps her memories are linked to her missing box. Conversation would then turn to Immerkind, Bae explaining that she would send the letter [in front Cecilia](https://youtu.be/L7rBGepFrXA?t=13807) so she can present her flowers after Cecilia finished reading. Gonathan promised to wingman for Bae when the morrow comes.

She would also need to build a safe room for her *children* but that is a quest for another day.
