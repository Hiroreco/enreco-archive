The successful businesswoman Roa wakes up and begins her day immediately checking on her business and employees; however, her attention is quickly stolen by the Red Knight, Lady Bloodflame. She confides her concerns to her employees and tries to assess the relationship between Nerissa and Lady Bloodflame.

Roa joins a raid team consisting of Nerissa, Liz, Bijou, and Shiori, but she leaves a [gift (one of several)](https://www.youtube.com/live/iWSC8XgRlqA?t=2440s) for Liz anonymously at her LOO before their departure, though she jealously watches as Nerissa and Liz interact with each other, her god eyes becoming a brighter hue.

Roa later meets Tam Tenders, and they share an emotional moment where they realize they remember each other. Roa offers almost everything to her queen.

After several dungeon incursions, Roa faces the Outlander and defeats him with ease through the power of [GACHARMS: Tiny Treasures, Infinite Pleasure! (Not Sponsored)](https://www.youtube.com/live/iWSC8XgRlqA?si=nWta_aNHR5pl4-Wp&t=11532.).

Roa, Irys, and Tam enter Bae's dungeon once again, where they spend time [untangling their complicated emotions and relationships while suffering through minigames](https://www.youtube.com/live/iWSC8XgRlqA?t=14740s), and Tam seeks forgiveness for only using Roa in hopes for a freebie (charms). Tammy seeks forgiveness and agrees to do anything in order to earn their forgiveness, even becoming a maid:

Roa concludes her day by [listening to the troubles](https://www.youtube.com/live/iWSC8XgRlqA?t=17650) of her employee, Bijou. After such an emotional day, Roa retires for the day and gets a well-deserved rest.
