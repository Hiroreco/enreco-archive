The events of yesterday lingered in Kiara's mind, and it was with concern that Kiara asked Mordan for a private word. Underneath the Chef's Tavern, Kiara [inquired about Mordan's well-being](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=836); the blind date had ended horribly for everyone, but especially for her fellow wolf. Mordan reassured her that, though she liked Gonathon, she would prioritize his feelings. But seeing the way Mordan put aside her own feelings, seemingly burying them within, made Kiara concerned.

In the midst of their talk, Elizabeth, Kiara's Sugar Child, would come by to request a legendary upgrade stone—Kiara quickly provided it and was delighted to guess that it was a gift meant for a [certain Raven](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1045), as the other woman frequently left gifts for Elizabeth. Elizabeth, flustered but not denying it, left.

The conversation then turned to Gonathon and Mordan's attempts, as Gonathon's therapist, to help the Good Knight remember his past—[to remember his Pearl](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1128) to lead him in the right direction. That a new love isn't what Gonathon needs, but rather the companionship of others. Kiara wondered if Mordan was projecting her own feelings, as she too felt that recently.

Kiara went back to her forge to see if Nerissa had bought something earlier. Elizabeth commented in surprise as she remembered Nerissa complained of being poor, to which Kiara would playfully disagree—especially if one were to compare Nerissa's wealth to Elizabeth's own. As her Sugar Matron, Kiara would [give money](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1419), causing the other to be thankfully embarrassed. Kiara would also come across a rather [pretty pink panther](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1535), to whom she promised to go to the new dungeon later.

And it seems Roa might remember something. Kiara, of course, knew they had been part of the same guild before, but could it be a sign? Would her friend remember their treasured bonds?

Kiara left for the newer Remnant fields to search for materials and the new Enigmatic Stones, commenting on the mysteriousness of these materials compared to the more common ores. She met Mordan again, the Lorekeepers fighting together against the Stains before, shortly, finding what seemed to be [a grave for one called "Anax."](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=4045) A journal left on the grave revealed a tragic tale.

At the job hall, Kiara would meet Ina and ask if she had received Kiara's letter. She did! [Ina would read out loud](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=4856). An apology for the slight yesterday, and Ina would wave it off, stating all is good, giving a potato as thanks.

By the wagon, Kiara found [Roa in a trance](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=5592). Perhaps a vision, one of Time, was coming back to her? While waiting for Roa to awaken, Kiara overheard Shiori complaining to Nerissa, guessing it was about Gonathon. [Kiara thought she could fix Shiori.](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=5673) Roa reawakened, and Kiara let her know they had found a group for the dungeon.

But it seemed it was not only Kiara and Shiori who were affected by the relationship drama. Kiara would comfort Gonathon when [he overheard others gossiping](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=6300).

And soon, the hour came again: a new dungeon to dive, one with Chaos as its name. And chaos it was, for though the challenges were simple in nature, they weren't in effort. After more party games than fights, eventually, the group would encounter the boss and, as before, win the battle. Though... something was missed, as luck was not on their side and they missed out on the treasured disc.

A chaotic memory unfolds: The Peasant The Bae's! Kiara likened the memory to her own, [more fun and silly than the memories before](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=8602). Another connection was how they helped others in simpler, but still meaningful, ways.

But it seemed the fight was not over. As she reported to the Princess, the Outlander returned, and soon, his history—and fate—was revealed. Now, [Kiara would prove her worth as a knight and hero](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=9733) against the Outlander, finishing the battle in her flaming Revelation. Now it seemed history would diverge, and the Outlander's fate may have finally changed. She left the Princess and Outlander alone, but before she did, a few questions were asked:

[_What Does Libestal Mean to You?_ **TO SAVE THE LESBIANS!**](#embed:https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=9949)

Kiara noticed her fellow knight's struggle against the Outlander and offered to give her some equipment to help in the battle, [fulfilling that promise](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=10623) shortly after it was made. As she went to her forge, Nerissa passed by to see if there were legendary upgrade stones. Pleased by the day's earnings, she would see to restock her wares.

Elizabeth then returned in [victory](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11357)—besting the Outlander, totally on the first try of course. Kiara felt proud of Elizabeth's progress. The Red Knight was already strong, and to see her become stronger was admirable.

But unfortunately, that strength caused a tense situation: [Knight Bloodflame suddenly attacked Nerissa, calling her a witch,](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11940) when the latter came by to see Elizabeth. Kiara quickly pulled Nerissa aside and [reassured her](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11984) that those were not Elizabeth's true feelings, and that there was fondness within the Red Knight's heart for the Blue Chef. Time is what Elizabeth needs. Kiara promised to be a wingman, but... carefully this time.

Today was a calmer day, and perhaps tomorrow would be a nice day off.
