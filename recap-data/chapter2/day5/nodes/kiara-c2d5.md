The events of yesterday lingered in Kiara's mind and it is with concern that Kiara asked Mordan for a private word. Underneath the Chef's Tavern, Kiara [inquired about Mordan's well-being](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=836); the blind-date had ended horribly for everyone, but especially for her fellow wolf. Mordan reassured her, that though she liked Gonathon, she would prioritised Gonathon's feelings. But seeing the way Mordan put aside her own feelings, seemingly burying it within, made Kiara concerned.

In the midst of their talk, Elizabeth, Kiara's Sugar Child, would come by to request a legendary upgrade stone - Kiara quickly provided and was delighted to guess that it was a gift meant for a [certain Raven](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1045) as the other woman would frequently leave gifts for Elizabeth. Elizabeth, flustered but didn't deny, left.

The conversation then turned to Gonathon and Mordan's attempts, as Gonathon's therapist, on helping the Good Knight remember his past - [to remember His Pearl](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1128) in order to lead him to the right direction. That a new love isn't what Gonathon needs, but companionship of others. Kiara wondered if Mordan was projecting her own feelings as she too felt that recently.

Kiara went back to her forge to see Nerissa bought something earlier. Elizabeth commented her surprise as she remembered Nerissa complained of being poor to which Kiara would playfully disagree; especially if one would compare Nerissa's wealth compares to Elizabeth's own. As her Sugar Matron, Kiara would [give money](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1419) to the other's thankful embarrassment. Kiara would also come across a rather [pretty pink panther](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=1535) whom she would promise to go to the new dungeon later.

And it seem Roa might remember something. Kiara of course knew they were part of the same guild before, but could it be a sign? Would her friend would remember their treasured bonds?

Kiara left for the newer Remnant fields to search for materials and the new Enigmatic Stones, commenting on the mysteriousness of the material compared to the more common ores. She met Mordan again, the Lorekeepers fighting together against the Stains before shortly, finding what seems to be [a grave for one called "Anax"](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=4045). A journal left on the grave revealed a tragic tale.

At the job hall, Kiara would meet Ina ask if she had received Kiara's letter. She did! [Ina would read out loud](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=4856). An apology for the slight yesterday and Ina would wave it off stating all is good, giving a potato as thanks.

By the wagon, Kiara found [Roa in a trance](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=5592). Perhaps a vision, one of Time, is coming back to her? While waiting for Roa to awaken, Kiara overhear Shiori's complaining to Nerissa, guessing it was about Gonathon. [Kiara could fix Shiori.](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=5673) Roa reawakens and Kiara would let her know they have found a group for the dungeon.

But it seems, it is not only Kiara and Shiori that are affected by the relationship Drama. Kiara would comfort Gonathon when [he overheard others were gossiping.](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=6300)

And soon, the hour comes again, a new dungeon to dive, one with Chaos as its name. And Chaos it is, for though the challenges are simple in nature, they aren't in effort. More party games than fights, eventually the group would encounter the Boss, and as before, win the battle. Though... something's missed as luck was not on their side as they lucked out on the treasured disc.

A chaotic memory unfolds: The Peasant The Bae's! Kiara likened the memory to her own, [fun and sillier to the memory's before](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=8602). Another connection would be how they helped others in simpler but still meaningful ways.

But it seems the fight is not over. As she reported to the Princess, the Outlander returned, and soon, his history - and fate - revealed. Now, [Kiara would prove her worth as a Knight and Hero](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=9733) against the Outlander, finishing the battle in her flaming Revelation. Now it seemed history shall diverge and the Outlander's fate may have finally been changed. She left the Princess and Outlander to alone, but before she does, A few questions would be asked:

[_What Does Libestal Mean to You?_ **TO SAVE THE LESBIANS!**](#embed:https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=9949)

Kiara noticed her fellow knight's struggle against the Outlander fight and offered to give her some equipment to help in the battle, [fulfilling that promise](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=10623) shortly after it was made. As she went to her forge, Nerissa passed by to see if there were legendary upgrade stones. Pleased by the earnings of the day, she would see to restock her wares.

Elizabeth then returned in [victory](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11357)! Besting the Outlander, totally on the first try of course. Kiara felt proud at Elizabeth's progressed. The Red Knight was already strong and to see her stronger was to be admired.

But unfortunately, a strength that caused a tense situation: [Knight Bloodflame would suddenly attack Nerissa, calling her a witch,](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11940) when the latter came by to see Elizabeth. Kiara quickly pulled Nerissa aside and [reassured her](https://youtu.be/0CHBuQwz_hY?t=11984) that it is not Elizabeth's true feelings and there is fondness within the Red Knight's heart for the Blue Chef. Time is what Elizabeth needs. Kiara promised to wingman but... carefully this time.

Today was a calmer day and perhaps tomorrow would be a nice day off.
