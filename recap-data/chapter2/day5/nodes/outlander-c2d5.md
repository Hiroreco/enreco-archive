He admitted it—he was the Watcher. He had seen a future where the Ruination consumed all. But he claimed he had changed. That was why he took on the guise of the nameless swordsman, to destroy the Heart of Ruin and stop the Ruination from devouring everything. Still, he couldn’t accept the idea that, in doing so, he would become a far greater evil.

And so, he issued a challenge to the heroes—not out of malice, but to test their strength, to see if they were truly worthy of being entrusted with the fate of the world.

And to answer that question, to solidify their resolve and earn his trust, the heroes gave their honest, heartfelt answers.
