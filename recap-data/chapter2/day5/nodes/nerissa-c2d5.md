The pieces have fallen into place. *She* shall return.

This was what she willed (see: [Elizabeth](#node:liz)), and so she shall bear witness to *her* existence.

But first, a quick word from our sponsor:

Welcome back.

The snowball began rolling as soon as *she* woke up, when *she* realized that their gallery had a shocking [content update](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=1510s). Why would she do that, *she* wondered.

Then [she](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=1950s) wouldn't look *her* in the eye. Just *her*. Why is she doing that, *she* wondered.

Then [she](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=2130s) started bringing up memories about *her*, which added more weight to *her* piling confusion. Why did she do that, *she* wondered.

Then [she](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=2795s) hit *her* head to get *her* Stain Hat off, didn't respond to *her* Upgrade Stone request and just stormed off mid-discussion. What is she going to do, *she* wondered.

Then [she](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=2890s) chased *her* away when *she*'s just trying to see what she's doing, yelling "Witch!" repeatedly at her. What is she doing, she wondered.

Then [she](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=2960s) sounded her *off* for trying to buy someone else's Upgrade Stone, saying *she* "guessed incorrectly". Why would she do that, she wondered.

Then, while [she](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=8985s) was in the Library, *she* stood behind her, around her, next to her. When *she* tried to stand in front of her, "Fia" shooed her away. She was so cute when she did that.

There was nothing that *Nerissa* could do to understand Elizabeth's desires.

It was so much easier to just [spiral](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=15920s).

There were so many [mixed signals](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=16180s).

But there was one thing about her that *she*'s certain of.

*She*, in the eyes and mind of the Knight, was supposed to be a *witch*.

So a *witch* [*she*](https://youtu.be/m5VOeHvSgbI?t=16220s) shall be.
