Right from the start of the fifth day, Elizabeth already had company. She was greeted by [Roa and Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=490s)  —friendly morning hellos, headpats exchanged—until the blue bird lady popped in, completely ruining the mood (or more accurately, ruining Elizabeth’s ability to keep her composure).

With actual people around her this time—unlike the solitude of the day before—Elizabeth joined the gang to tackle the Star Site: Chronos dungeon. Upon completion, she recovered memories of Ouro Kronii and came to a simple yet powerful realization: having others around really did make all the [difference](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=6644s).

Next came the Star Site: Chaos dungeon, presumably one of the last major ones and a particularly intriguing one, where the aspect of chance dictated the flow. Still, alongside Bijou, Shiori, and Nerissa, Elizabeth powered through and recovered the memories of [Hakos Baelz](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?si=1zrJ9s4OAUQLt_pm&t=9740).

Then came a true test of strength and courage. The Outlander challenged Elizabeth to a duel—a trial to determine if the heroes were worthy of carrying the fate of the world. Though she stumbled a few times, Elizabeth held her ground and proved her worth.

With all the main tasks out of the way, the day slowly descended into madness. It started with a heartfelt conversation with [Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/live/9gL4We5utAk?t=13255s), but somehow everything spiraled and the spotlight shifted to Nerissa. Even the gods themselves chimed in, calling out to Elizabeth to “give Nerissa a chance,” all due to a supposed misunderstanding that unfolded earlier in the day (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: No Room for Drama](#edge:liz-nerissa)). The cape of wisdom also made a return.

Once the chaos subsided, Elizabeth wound down, penned a letter to Shakira expressing her appreciation, and finally called it a day.
