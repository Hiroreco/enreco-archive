Cold. Lonely.

A small stain-looking child sits among the similarly looking hats in one of Libestal's shops. 

She's been here for a long while now, just waiting... for someone. Memories of the past too painful to remember - a feeling of warmth now left terribly cold.

"Oh! I want this one, my good fellow!"

Warm hands suddenly, but oh so gentle, took her from the pile to be placed on a head with soft red hair. Though scared at first, Khaos soon found herself carried almost everywhere; from the peaceful fields of Libestals to the admittedly terrifying Dungeons, Khaos was never alone. Not anymore.

It was frightening at first, to suddenly be at the hands, well, head, of a stranger. But that feeling was quick to fade. The red-head, Peasant The Bae, would looked at Khaos warmly, as if she was more than just a simple mistaken hat.

As if she was a child deserved to be treasured. 

Unwittingly, Khaos overheard much of Bae's randomly muttering of her own Mother. One who would speak of lessons when Bae was younger, to guide the young rat in the wise ways of peasantry. Khaos would listen silently and wondered, is this what's it like to have a 'Mother'?


So, child and Mother would spend their days in Libestal; the child watching and learning, the Mother mining and crafting. Mother ensuring the child does not fall from her head by accident while going up the waterfall. 

Of course, when there are peaceful days, there too must be days of hardship, Khaos remembered Mother said once.

One such day came in the form of shiny Princess called Bijou. Khaos would note warily that the Princess would stare at her at times, intensely as if memories will come back to her if Bijou stared at Khaos long enough. Khaos in turn would wonder why the princess looked oddly familiar.

Eventually, the past unveiled itself:

Bijou would confront Bae about Khaos, about her regrets, about her foolishness, and the intent to make things right - to Khaos's other mother, at least.

Khaos was too young to remember the past but all she wanted was the present. Her Mother.

It only brought a large sense of relief when Mother refused to part with her. That Mother viewed Khaos as child of her own.

It was terrifying to see Mother so angry against everyone and Khaos was glad to see that everyone reconciled in the end. Though she's a little bit wary of Princess-Mother, it seems she did not dislike Khaos. 

Now, Khaos waits for a new room. One for her and her new little sibling too!
