#### Main Story

The fifth day brought the final star site: **Star Site: Chaos**, where the heroes uncovered the memories of Hakos Baelz, along with the last fragment of Fia’s missing memories.

This memory differed from the rest—it revealed nothing more about the Outsider. Instead, it offered a somber glimpse into the Princess’s past: her favorite doll and the tragic fate of her parents, who perished as a result of the corruption’s spread. Yet the memory placed particular emphasis on the doll—a keepsake from the Princess’s mother, later passed to her father. The doll was promised to watch over and protect whoever it was given to.

Additionally, the Outlander finally revealed his true identity as the Watcher. After witnessing the heroes' unwavering determination to save the world, he chose to entrust them with that burden. For the first time, he agreed not to shoulder it himself—so that he might avoid punishment from the Higher Being.
