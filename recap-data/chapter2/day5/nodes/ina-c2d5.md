<!-- title: NinoIna -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

NinoIna's consciousness returned to the Kingdom of Libestal in the Library, and the very first scene to greet her eyes was the figure of her consort eternal. It was cute! They had a whole thing about how fate brought them together, clearly a divine sign that they were meant for each other. Verily, the Hero and her Goddess knew not what was about to transpire on this new day and what Lady Fate [had in store for them](https://youtu.be/UyN7jwsiiXA?t=17578s) tomorrow.

Surely the Hero would take the news in stride.

Anyway, watch as the well-rested Hero and co. inspect the totally-not-a-Necronomicon-like object she wields in the battlefields. The tome bends reality in such a way that its very manifestation in this world is obscure, but one thing's for sure: it is a [progenitor](https://youtu.be/OxKP4ED-xz8?t=278s). Of what, who knows—the book is sealed shut—but actions speak louder than written words. Hardcover equals hard-hitting slam ~~poetry~~.

The Hot Purple One was distinct from her Pink counterpart in that _she_ was perfectly literate, and her Revelation showcase was not the only time she was put to the test today:

- Shakira made her thoughts heard, seeking amends for her transgressions (see: [Ina-Kiara: Love Thy Neighbor](#edge:ina-kiara)).
- The Peasant penned [a confession](https://youtu.be/OxKP4ED-xz8?t=978s) to a knight who was at the dentist, and Ina was its beta reader. It was good enough to publish as is!
- Later on, the highly discussed Hot Pink One [received the wrong charm](https://youtu.be/OxKP4ED-xz8?t=5606s)... Oh, I guess heroes do get some things wrong.

While she would not get to see the resolution to her [Sneak 100 cutscene](https://youtu.be/OxKP4ED-xz8?t=1606s) (see: [Bae-Khaos](#edge:bae-khaos)), she left her mark by [helping author](https://youtu.be/OxKP4ED-xz8?t=1902s) the Baece Attorney event that leads to it. Such was the humble Hero's fate to miss out on [cinema](https://youtu.be/OxKP4ED-xz8?t=12740s).

The potato fairy's prophet rolled a Nat 20 on [persuading Chaos Incarnate](https://youtu.be/OxKP4ED-xz8?t=3641s) to singlehandedly shift the paradigm of potato stonks. Granted, she still needed to [guide the hand of entropy](https://youtu.be/OxKP4ED-xz8?t=5259s), but there was no price too big for a bountiful harvest on the morrow.

Shortly before logging off, Ina squeezed in some more illegally obtained [rising action](https://youtu.be/OxKP4ED-xz8?t=7146s) footage (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: No Room for Drama](#edge:liz-nerissa)). Not really sure what to make of it, but she'll [sleep on it](https://youtu.be/OxKP4ED-xz8?t=8162s) for the time being.
