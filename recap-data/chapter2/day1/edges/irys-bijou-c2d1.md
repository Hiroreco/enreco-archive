<!-- title: Onii-chan -->

From side chicks to sidebros—a development that transcended all boundaries (especially the gender one), but here we are. Having forgotten the messy details of their previous divorce, the Hot Pink One and Koseki Bijou found themselves bound together once more. Only this time, it wasn’t through romance, but through something far more powerful: brotherhood.

Surprisingly, they got along splendidly. It started with the exchange of ancient wisdom—secret arts passed down through generations (or maybe just made up on the spot): the “bro tug,” the “chicken jockey,” and the sacred “flint and steel.” These teachings forged something greater than a mere alliance, culminating in the gemstone calling the pink menace her **“Onii-chan.”** And just like that, their sibling status—*kyodai*—was sealed.

The two spent nearly the entire day side by side. Through sticks and stones, blood and tears, they stuck together. They were even the last two to call it a day, staying up to help set up each other's shops like true business partners, or delinquent siblings.

No one could have predicted such a twist in fate—but in this strange new world, somehow, it just made sense.
