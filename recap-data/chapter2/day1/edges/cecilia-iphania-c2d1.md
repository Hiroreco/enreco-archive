<!-- title: Vow -->

She made her way to the meeting chamber, and as her eyes landed on the radiant figure seated within—[Princess Iphania](#node:iphania)—Cecilia felt her breath catch ever so slightly.

Leaning toward Gonathon, she whispered, voice light but sincere:

["Don’t you think she is cute?"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyLsX20esBE&t=3677s)

And how could one disagree? That gentle elegance, the fire hidden beneath her calm exterior, the unwavering resolve to pull a crumbling kingdom back from the edge—it was everything Cecilia admired, everything she dreamed of. Though the princess had lost nearly all her memories, perhaps that made it all the more fitting. For Cecilia, it truly was love at first sight—again.

Gonathon, ever the dependable companion, offered his help in Cecilia’s new endeavor: to win the heart of the one who ruled hers.

With a quiet smile and knightly grace, Cecilia bent the knee—not just to her mission, but to the feelings stirring in her heart. And with renewed resolve, she pressed forward in her journey to save the world.

Later, while wandering the castle halls, Cecilia stumbled upon the princess’s private chambers. There, surrounded by soft silks and the lingering warmth of royalty, she felt utterly captivated. She breathed in the faint, sweet scent of the bedsheets, eyes drifting toward the window where moonlight poured in.

And in that moment, she made a vow—soft but certain, spoken to no one but the stars:

She would save the world.
And she would marry the princess.
