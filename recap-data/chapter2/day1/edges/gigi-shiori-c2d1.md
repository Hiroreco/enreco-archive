<!-- title: Can She Fix Her? -->

Shiori and Gonathon have a rather complicated relationship. While on the surface their constant efforts to help one another seem to be born of mutual respect and a desire to assist one another, on closer inspection it becomes apparent that Shiori views Gonathon as an easy mark, at least at first. 

In their first encounter, Shiori attempted to [scam Gonathon out of all of her gold](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=9251), but quickly gave up upon realizing just how naive and generous the humble knight was. The two then adventured for a while, quickly forming a bond due to their mutual hatred of all things flying. Shiori would go on to teach Gonathon how to milk a cow before the two parted ways. 

The next time Gonathon would encounter Shiori the knight's values would be put to the test. Shiori earnestly requested Gonathon's aid in her feud with Morden Ramsey, [claiming her rival chef was demeaning her store](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=12331). However, Gonathon would soon learn the truth, and indignant over Shiori's betrayal, sought to reveal her crimes to Tam Gandr. Upon reading a [seemingly heartfelt letter](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=13233) from Shiori thanking Gonathon for purchasing her food, Gonathon retracted her accusations. 

After writing her own letter to Shiori in which she struggled with the prickly topic of the Chef Wars, Gonathon became determined to learn more about Shiori, expressing a belief that Shiori meant well. Only time will tell whether this proves true, or whether the tricky Archiver continues to prey on the naive knight.
