<!-- title: Knight in any Universe -->

Immerkind strolls through the city when she see's the Princess Bijou toiling through her work. Bijou no longer remembers Cecilia but is wary of anyone who calls themselves [kind](https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?t=7233s).

Cecilia assures her that she is kind. The Immerkind name was given to her and she is destined to live up to it.

Bijou is seeking to make amends to the wrongs of her past but Cecilia stops her. Immerkind sternly proclaims that it [isn't your fault](https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?t=7267s). Bijou's eyes sparkles, relieved of the burden and agrees.

Princess Bijou asks if Cecilia will be her knight once more. Cecilia proclaims solemnly "You know what, no matter how much time passes. I will always be your knight (if you pay me)".
