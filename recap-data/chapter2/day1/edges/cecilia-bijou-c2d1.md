<!-- title: Knight in any Universe -->

Immerkind strolls through the city when she sees Princess Bijou toiling away at her work. Bijou no longer remembers Cecilia but is wary of anyone who calls themselves [kind](https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?t=7233s).

Cecilia assures her that she is kind. The Immerkind name was given to her, and she is destined to live up to it.

Bijou is seeking to make amends for the wrongs of her past, but Cecilia stops her. Immerkind sternly proclaims that it [isn't your fault](https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?t=7267s), and Bijou's eyes sparkle, relieved of the burden.

Princess Bijou asks if Cecilia will be her knight once more. Cecilia proclaims solemnly, "You know what? No matter how much time passes, I will always be your knight (if you pay me)."
