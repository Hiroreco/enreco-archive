<!-- title: Up Dog -->

Cecilia Immerkind runs into Gonathon in the dining hall. She notes that Gonathon is suffering from hearing and memory problems. Using her vast knowledge of the brain surgery, Cecilia swiftly delivers [multiple blows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyLsX20esBE&t=3340s) to Gonathon's head. The troubleshooting continues as Immerkind helps Gonathon fine tune the voices in his head where they discover it's stuck on [system default](https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?si=nyrhw0A3elGdzyWG&t=4008).

Gonathon declares his intenton to help Cecilia to [woo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyLsX20esBE&t=3677s) the princess. While Gonathon has not retained his memory, his heart of gold remains.

Their next meeting occurs as Cecilia explores the surrounding area, she see's Gonathon being tracked down by a [dreaded bird](https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?si=heSaCd2NMHfPv-Ah&t=6718)and gracefully slays it. Immerkind warns Gonathon to be careful of the company she keeps and reminds him of what he once was:

The two banter about the meaning of "Up Dog" and the philosophy of Mordan Ramsey of what makes two close dawgs. As they bond, Cecilia agrees to become dawgs with Gonathon.
