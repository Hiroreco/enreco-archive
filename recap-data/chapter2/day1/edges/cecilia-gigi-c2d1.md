<!-- title: Up Dog -->

Cecilia Immerkind runs into Gonathon in the dining hall. She notes that Gonathon is suffering from hearing and memory problems. Using her vast knowledge of brain surgery, Cecilia swiftly delivers [multiple blows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyLsX20esBE&t=3340s) to Gonathon's head. The troubleshooting continues as Immerkind helps Gonathon fine-tune the voices in his head, where they discover it's stuck on [system default](https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?si=nyrhw0A3elGdzyWG&t=4008).

Their past journey is echoed in the present: these two, one green and one orange, instinctively have each other's back in times of need, their personalities bouncing off each other with amazing ease. It seems this new adventure would be no different for their enduring bond.

Gonathon declares his intent to help Cecilia [woo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyLsX20esBE&t=3677s) the princess. While Gonathon has not retained his memory, his heart of gold remains.

Their next meeting occurs as Cecilia explores the surrounding area. She sees Gonathon being tracked down by a [dreaded bird](https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?si=heSaCd2NMHfPv-Ah&t=6718) and gracefully slays it. Immerkind warns Gonathon to be careful of the company he keeps and reminds him of what he once was:

The two banter about the meaning of "up dog" and the philosophy of Mordan Ramsey on what makes two close dawgs. As they bond, Cecilia agrees to become dawgs with Gonathon.
