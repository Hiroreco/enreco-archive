<!-- title: I Met My Ex-Wife in Libestal But We Both Forgot Our Memories -->

Though they may not remember, some things don't change between worlds. 

In a familiar song and dance, Hakos Baelz and IRyS once again clash; anything the Hot Pink One says is [incomprehensible](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=3182) to Peasant The Bae's ears and the feeling is quite mutual. The Hot Pink One is quite generous to feed anyone she comes across with the exception of the peasant. But this does not stop business, with Bae agreeing to be the Hot Pink One's SC (supply chain) for her consort's concert at the end of their adventure.

Despite the playful animosity, they continue to meet as they go throughout the day, bantering as they go on. Bae [teases](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=4012) the Hot Pink One when she [needs materials](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=5192), but ultimately trades the iron for some bread.
