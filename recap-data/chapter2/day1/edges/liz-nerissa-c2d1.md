<!-- title: She's Jesting, Right? -->

She was a witch—had always been a witch—the very same witch who had caused Elizabeth countless headaches, who brought more trouble than anything else. But she was _the_ witch. The one Elizabeth had once risked her life to protect. The one she knew, deep down, was a kind and loving soul who looked out for others... even if she delighted in teasing Elizabeth for reasons only known to her. Still, Elizabeth wouldn’t trade what they had for anything.

And now was no different. Even in another world, Elizabeth believed things would stay the same—the same teasing, the same exasperation, the same feelings.

Or so she hoped.

When Nerissa greeted the red knight with unfamiliar eyes, Elizabeth felt a sharp tug at her heart. At first, she brushed it off, convinced the witch was simply jesting—messing with her, as usual. But as their conversation went on, the truth became clear. Nerissa really didn’t remember her. Not even her beloved potato salads. Elizabeth didn’t quite know how to respond to that… except by being herself. Even if Nerissa had forgotten her, the feelings remained. And perhaps, just perhaps, if she kept up the same attitude she always had, Nerissa would remember in time.

As if their bond had never truly been severed, the two crossed paths again and again. When Elizabeth was off building in solitude, Nerissa was there, keeping her [company](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=A837PYRSHvJus1sJ&t=8673). And when Nerissa wandered off to tend to her own matters, Elizabeth was never far behind—[watching](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=YfAOcQoIOWbai1uL&t=5607) over her, just like she always used to.

Maybe not all was lost. Maybe something still lingered between them. Until that day came—until Nerissa Ravencroft remembered—Elizabeth wouldn’t change a thing.
