<!-- title: My Dawg -->
<!-- relationship: Dawg -->

Among the slew of familiar faces, Gonathon bonded most with the pink-haired Mordan Ramsey. Mordan, who had retained her memories, seemed to harbor a strong interest in the humble Knight, a sentiment rooted deeply in their past adventures and her lasting impression of him. She saw him as a kind, trusting Knight, profoundly caring for those around him, especially a particular blonde. Gonathon, in turn, was instantly enamored with Mordan, particularly given her apparent role as the "Savior of Libestal," and the two quickly hit it off.

Mordan introduced the concept of a ["dawg"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT2cj934-I&t=5384s) to the Humble Knight, which she explained to be a sort of soul bond. The two agreed to become dawgs, with Gonathon enjoying the title so much he requested that another one of his closest companions become dawgs [as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT2cj934-I&t=6923s).

Gonathon remained staunchly loyal to Mordan. When Shiori and Mordan began to feud over food prices, Gonathon wished to hear her out despite Shiori's desperate plea. Ultimately, he sided with Mordan upon learning the truth of Shiori's schemes.

Mordan, for her part, seemed oddly smitten with Gonathon, to the point of wanting to give him several [objects of affection](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=5250). Only time will tell if the humble Knight will reciprocate or even become aware of these feelings.
