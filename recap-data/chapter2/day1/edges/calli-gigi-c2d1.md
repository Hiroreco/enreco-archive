<!-- title: My Dawg -->

Among the slew of familiar faces, the one that Gonathon bonded the most with was the pink-haired Morden Ramsey. As a member of Myth, Morden now retained all of her memories and seemed to have a strong interest in the humble knight. And with Morden seemingly being the "Savior of Libestal", Gonathon was instantly enamored by her and the two hit it off quickly.

Morden introduced the concept of a ["dawg"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT2cj934-I&t=5384s) to the humble knight, which she explained to be a sort of soulbound. The two agreed to become dawgs, with Gonathon enjoying the title so much she requested [another one of closest companions to become dawgs as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT2cj934-I&t=6923s) 

Despite the misgivings of Cecelia Immerkind, Gonathon would remain staunchly loyal to Morden. When Shiori of the Nyavellas and Morden began to feud over food prices, Gonathon wished to hear her out despite Shiori's desperate plea and ultimately took her side upon learning the truth of Shiori's schemes.

Morden for her part seems oddly smitten with Gonathon, to the point of [wishing to gift her several objects of affection.](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=5250) Only time will tell if the humble knight will reciprocate, or even become aware of these feelings.
