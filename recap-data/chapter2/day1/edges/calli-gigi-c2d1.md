<!-- title: My Dawg -->

Among the slew of familiar faces, the one whom Gonathon bonded the most with was the pink-haired Mordan Ramsey. As a member of Myth, Mordan who retained her memory, seemed to have a strong interest in the humble knight. And with Mordan seemingly being the "Savior of Libestal," Gonathon was instantly enamored with her, and the two hit it off quickly.

Mordan introduced the concept of a ["dawg"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT2cj934-I&t=5384s) to the humble knight, which she explained to be a sort of soul bond. The two agreed to become dawgs, with Gonathon enjoying the title so much she requested that [another one of her closest companions become dawgs as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT2cj934-I&t=6923s) 

Despite the misgivings of Cecelia Immerkind, Gonathon would remain staunchly loyal to Mordan. When Shiori of the Nyavellas and Mordan began to feud over food prices, Gonathon wished to hear her out despite Shiori's desperate plea and ultimately took her side upon learning the truth of Shiori's schemes.

Mordan, for her part, seemed oddly smitten with Gonathon, to the point of [wanting to give her several objects of affection.](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=5250) Only time will tell if the humble knight will reciprocate or even become aware of these feelings.
