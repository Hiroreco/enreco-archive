<!-- title: Consort, Again -->
<!-- relationship: Marriage -->

The love of her life had returned—her eternal consort, her walking bank account, her one and only Ninomae Ina’nis.

And yes, she was still illiterate.

They say true love stands the test of time—and apparently, the test of memory loss and time travel too. But their relationship didn’t stop at rekindling romance—it evolved.
