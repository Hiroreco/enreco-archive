<!-- title: A Sense Of Loyalty -->

Despite losing his memories, nothing could shake the unbreakable oath that Gonathon had with his queen, Tam Gandr. Upon their first meeting in the new world, Gonathon expressed a familiarity with Tam and a desire to assist her.

The two quickly rekindled their old bond, with Gonathon teaching Tam [a number of techniques](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=12900), and it culminated in Tam being [the first customer](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=10788) to Gonathon's new smithy. All the while, Gonathon [mused about how kindhearted Tam was](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=4910), even if he still was not exactly sure what kind of bond they had before. Tam, for her part, also felt a bond with Gonathon, although only time will tell what memories might return.
