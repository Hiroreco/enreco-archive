<!-- title: Enemy -->

Cecilia has become a newly appointed supplier in Libestal. As she gathers her gear and prepares to depart, she runs into a fellow Star who describes herself as "Peasant the Bae."

They depart for the Remnants where they get to work. With her newfound job and comrade, she creates a monopoly. But their definitions of riches differ. Bae seeks fortune, whereas Immerkind seeks to enrich the lives of others with kindness and supplies:

["We will get rich with kindness!"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?si=98NttHZqZvCyfV3K&t=5215)

But this camaraderie would not last long. During Cecilia's studies in the Library, she runs into a despondent Bae who has lost all her money gambling. Cecilia attempts to [give Bae advice](https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?si=KpxqsgufX3tkxSra&t=8052) to resolve her financial problems and provide some funds. But Bae would not listen. She takes the money and faces Cecilia:

["I AM GOING TO BE A PEASANT"](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/cyLsX20esBE?t=8105s)

Bae disappears with a mocking laugh. Immerkind realizes she must warn the others before their kindness is also taken for granted.
