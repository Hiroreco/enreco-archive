<!-- title: Forget and Forgive -->

In a shocking turn of events, one of Gonathon's former greatest adversaries, the Hot Pink One, seemingly became one of her closest friends and...brother?!

With only vague fragments of their [past animosity](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=6268) remaining, the two quickly hit it off, with Gonathon quick to run to her aid in HPO's utterly dire predicament. Gonathon was particularly inspired by HPO's passionate call to lower food prices and expressed a desire to partake in her cake when her shop opened.

While the Hot Pink One seems to be up to her [old tricks](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=15616) when it comes to the other members, her camaraderie and familial bond to Gonathon seem genuine, although only time will tell if this holds true.
