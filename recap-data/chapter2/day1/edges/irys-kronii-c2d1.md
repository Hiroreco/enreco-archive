<!-- title: Tammy and Pinky -->
<!-- relationship: Romantic -->

Tam Gandr was once in love with the Hot Pink One. The Hot Pink One was once her loyal (well, _maybe_ loyal) servant. Their history together was brief but bizarrely intense—a relationship layered with sarcasm, unresolved tension, and just the right amount of chaos. And now, fate had tossed them back together, giving them a clean slate... or at least a reset button.

Tam, ever sharp-tongued and regal in demeanor, upon learning the pink one was that of a culinary kind, wasted no time reestablishing the power dynamic—_her_ power dynamic. She stared the Hot Pink One down and declared, with the elegance and subtlety of a sledgehammer:

A proclamation that would surely make 1950s housewives proud and modern sensibilities cry (tears of joy of course).

The Hot Pink One didn’t seem offended. Perhaps because this was their love language. Or maybe because she couldn’t be bothered. Either way, the two fell right back into their usual rhythm—whatever that rhythm was. Love? Servitude? Mutual delusion? No one could tell. But it worked for them.

What was certain was that their bond, however undefined and slightly unhinged, was real. Real enough for nicknames. Real enough for jabs. Real enough for something that looked a lot like familiarity—whether that was a blessing or a curse remained to be seen.
