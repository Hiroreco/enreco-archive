## Day 1: The Chains of Employment

The kingdom of Libestal has returned—but something is… off. Our heroes have traveled back in time?! As if the whole “the King was evil and the old kingdom was a fabricated illusion” twist wasn’t enough, now we’ve got _time travel_ thrown into the mix. But alright, maybe it’s not so bad, they just need to—oh, they’ve also lost their memories. Again???

Forget the bonds, the connections, the whole history they’d built up—our heroes now begin anew. A new kingdom, new lives, even new identities. But one thing hasn’t changed: their mission to recover their shattered memories and, somehow, save the world—no, the universe—from the great evil known as the _Outsider_.

The Ancient Kingdom of Libestal also brings new systems for the heroes to learn. Guilds are gone, replaced by _Jobs_, and each hero is free to choose the path they wish to walk:

- **The Smith:** Crafts upgrade stones used to enhance Revelation Weapons.
- **The Jeweler:** Crafts charms that boost health and defense.
- **The Chef:** Cooks meals that grant adventuring buffs.
- **The Supplier:** Enchants tools, improving resource gathering.

The kingdom itself has undergone a makeover too. With a strong wooden motif, it carries a distinctly medieval vibe. No tyrannical King this time—replacing him is Princess Iphania, the current ruler. Alongside her is a mysterious talking cat named Fia, who manages a place known as the _Library_.

The Library holds the memories of everything, and it's now tended by lorekeepers, Calli and Kiara, who work with Fia to archive the new stories our heroes will forge. At the end of each day, everyone is expected to write a diary entry about their journey and submit it to the Library.

How will any of this help save the universe? Who knows? But it's only Day 1—the start of a new adventure, a chance to forge new bonds and rediscover old ones. Forget world-saving for now. First, our heroes need to get a grip on their new lives and roles, because before anything else, they need to _pay the bills_.
