The fluffy one’s beginning mirrored that of all the others—she was given the rundown of her situation, her mission, and the state she was in: missing a piece of her memories (see [Fia](#node:fia) and [Princess Iphania](#node:iphania)). She was understandably confused, but, as always, she faced her new reality with quiet resolve. Just like in her past journey, she accepted her role and duties without hesitation.

When asked to choose an occupation, Fuwawa became a chef. Her reason was simple and heartfelt: she wanted to bring people together through food, to create joyful moments with her cooking—a touching motive that fit her perfectly.

And so her new adventure began. Thanks to the familiarity of the kingdom’s mechanics from her previous life, the fluffy one had a much easier time settling into this strange, yet oddly familiar world. Along the way, she encountered old acquaintances—or perhaps new ones? With her memories fragmented, she couldn’t be sure. She remembered her beloved bread lady, [Elizabeth](https://www.youtube.com/live/-zBlbI-EuCw?si=wV_c4zN2N9MCFymM&t=5394), but drew a blank on the striking blue maiden before her. So she gave her a name of her own:

Then came the cooking. She was a chef, after all. From soups to potato salads, Fuwawa happily prepared meal after meal. It quickly became clear she had made the right decision—cooking was easy, fun, and most importantly, fulfilling.

She spent time exploring the kingdom, inspecting the [kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zBlbI-EuCw&t=8953s) she would come to know well, and even visited the gallery where she stumbled upon a nostalgic painting of herself from a past she could still recall.

As the day came to a close, the doggo continued doing what she loved. She even attempted to bake a cake—though that endeavor didn’t go quite as planned, and she ultimately gave up. Still, it was a sweet and fluffy end to a sweet and fluffy start.
