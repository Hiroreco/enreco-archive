When one chapter ends, another must soon begin.

Once again, Peasant The Bae finds herself trapped in a familiar room with equally familiar people. A hero? A princess? But before they could talk, a darkness enveloped them all and an unknown voice spoke.

A mysterious cat named Fia brought Bae and her maybe friends back to the past, in an abandoned temple hides The Library, a special place that exists between worlds. There, she told them of The Outsider, the one who donned on the King's skin and tricked them into freeing him from his prison. The Libestal they knew was but an illusion to keep The Outsider locked in but now that he runs free, millions of worlds are now in jeopardy.

But there is a way to stop him...

In the past before The Outsider truly came to be, Peasant The Bae can be the hero the world needs. The key to their victory lies in the missing memories of all our heroes and Fia. Star-shaped crystals, the form their memories took, are scattered throughout the world. With each memory recovered, the power of their Revelation would strengthened and they grow closer to finding the key to defeat The Outsider.

Soon after arriving in Ancient Libestal, Bae meets the Princess Iphinia, Libestal's remaining royal. The Princess tells of them of the Ruination and that the end will come after 7 Days. Though Bae's mission differs from Princess Iphinia's own goal to defy the fate of her Kingdom, she graciously allows our heroes to take on jobs and to prepare for their respective quests.

Now no longer jobless, but still poor, Bae sets out to explore the kingdom meeting fellow heroes, though some conversations were admittedly [questionable](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2293). Even if the dungeon is still not yet available, it does not mean that the day is wasted. Together with Tammy, Ina, and Gonathan with a G, the group explored The Library and found codes hidden within the texts of the books, including [Fia's](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2910) bringing suspicion their benefactor.

Soon after leaving The Library, Peasant The Bae meets The Hot Pink One once again, finding that the HPOs are married. Whenever The Hot Pink One speaks, it leaves Bae annoyed though she still eventually agreed to being the SC, supply chain, for HPO's the consort's concert. Throughout the rest of day, Bae would find the Hot Pink One constantly nearby.

After some guidance, Bae finds her way to Job Hall to accept her quest and begin her work as a Supplier. Together with fellow Supplier Cecilia Immerkind, they left for the mines to mine Lapis Lazuli, learning on the way of their abilities to improve the quality of their tools. As they gathered materials, Cecilia and Bae bonded over their previously unemployment status and the woes of being chosen as heroes. After gathering more materials, Peasant The Bae soon learns that she would need better quality tools and must purchase them from the seller.

Soon after gathering enough materials, Bae learns that she would need coins to purchase better tools. In order to accomplish this, she sets out to defeat Stains that littered the kingdom and soon enough earnt [enough and more.](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=7007)

Going back to the Kingdom, Bae finished her job and trades some iron ore to Shakira and receives an upgrade stone. With money now in her pockets and tools enchanted well all seems well for our beloved Bae. But alas, misfortune would soon befall her...

Gacha. Gacha would soon leave Bae poor once again as she attempted, and failed (even after receiving gold from Cecilia to save wisely), to obtain any of the special prizes. Though, it would not keep her down as she would write in her journal that she remained through to her soul: [A Peasant.](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=8145)
