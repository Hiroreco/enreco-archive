When one chapter ends, another must soon begin.

Once again, Peasant The Bae finds herself trapped in a familiar room with equally familiar people. A hero? A princess? But before they could talk, a darkness enveloped them all, and an unknown voice spoke.

[The Outsider](#embed:https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=454)

A mysterious cat named Fia brought Bae and her maybe-friends back to the past, in an abandoned temple hides the Library, a special place that exists between worlds. There, she told them of the Outsider, the one who donned the King's skin and tricked them into freeing him from his prison. The Libestal they knew was but an illusion to keep the Outsider locked in, but now that he runs free, millions of worlds are now in jeopardy.

But there is a way to stop him...

In the past, before the Outsider truly came to be, Peasant The Bae could be the hero the world needs. The key to their victory lies in the missing memories of all our heroes and Fia. Star-shaped crystals, the form their memories took, are scattered throughout the world. With each memory recovered, the power of their Revelation would be strengthened, and they would grow closer to finding the key to defeat the Outsider.

Soon after arriving in Ancient Libestal, Bae meets Princess Iphinia, Libestal's last remaining royal. The Princess tells them of the Ruination and that the end will come after seven days. Though Bae's mission differs from Princess Iphinia's own goal to defy the fate of her Kingdom, she graciously allows our heroes to take on jobs and to prepare for their respective quests.

Now no longer jobless, but still poor, Bae sets out to explore the Kingdom, meeting fellow heroes, though some conversations were admittedly [questionable](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2293). Even if the dungeon is still not yet available, it does not mean that the day is wasted. Together with Tammy, Ina, and Gonathon with a G, the group explored the Library and found codes hidden within the texts of the books, including [Fia's](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=2910), bringing suspicion to their benefactor.

Soon after leaving the Library, Peasant The Bae meets the Hot Pink One once again, finding that the HPO is married. Whenever the Hot Pink One speaks it leaves Bae annoyed. Though she still eventually agreed to be the SC, supply chain, for HPO's consort. Throughout the rest of the day, Bae would find the Hot Pink One constantly nearby.

After some guidance, Bae finds her way to the Job Hall to accept a quest and begin her work as a Supplier. Together with fellow Supplier Cecilia Immerkind, they left for the mines to mine lapis lazuli. Along the way they learned of their abilities to improve the quality of their tools. As they gathered materials, Cecilia and Bae bonded over their previous unemployment status and the woes of being chosen as heroes. After gathering more materials, Peasant The Bae soon learns that she would need higher quality tools and must purchase them from the shop.

Soon after gathering enough materials, Bae learned that she would need coins to purchase better tools. In order to accomplish this, she set out to defeat Stains that littered the Kingdom and soon earned [more than enough.](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=7007)

Once back in the Kingdom, Bae finished her job and traded some iron ore to Shakira and received an upgrade stone. With money now in her pockets and tools enchanted well, all seems well for our beloved Bae. But alas, misfortune would soon befall her...

Gacha. Gacha would soon leave Bae poor once again as she attempted, and failed (even after receiving gold from Cecilia to save wisely), to obtain any of the special prizes. However, it would not keep her down as she would write in her journal that she remained true to her soul: [A Peasant.](https://youtu.be/7bOe38rP7JQ?t=8145)
