The Hot Pink One had forgotten—_actually_ forgotten. Not from amnesia, not from time travel, not from magical interference. She just… [forgot](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=pjoUkIMvyhTJhGRu&t=375). The Outsider? The King? None of those names registered, not even a flicker of recognition when they were brought up.

But what she _didn’t_ forget were the people she was about to meet.

She was briefed on the world's looming threat, how she and her fellow heroes were once again called upon to save everything from destruction. Most of it went in one ear and out the other. What _did_ catch her attention, though, was when Calli mentioned that everyone was expected to keep a daily journal of their journey. Writing? The Hot Pink One? Absolutely not. She hated words with a passion. So, in true Hot Pink fashion, she tried to weasel her way out of it by claiming to be illiterate. A grown woman pretending she can't read—classic.

To avoid anything that might require literacy, she chose a job that wouldn’t involve [reading or writing](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=HR2XQ6PjVgzkLghk&t=1475): chef.

And with that, her new journey began. Almost immediately, her infamous “Hot Pink Aura” started drawing people in. Cecilia Immerkind quickly reminded her that HPO stood for “Hard Potential Oliver” and that they were the best of friends. Bijou, after a brief conversation, remembered her too—and they instantly became sworn brothers (see [Cecilia–Hot Pink One: Huh puh](#edge:cecilia-irys) and [Bijou–Hot Pink One: Onii-chan](#edge:irys-bijou)).

She then reunited with NinoIna and Peasant the Bae, reestablishing their previous connections—Consort and Peasant respectively (see [Hot Pink One–Ina: Consort, again](#edge:ina-irys)).

Then came Tam Gandr—Timmy, as the Hot Pink One decided to call her (see [Tam Gandr–Hot Pink One: Timmy and Pinky](#edge:irys-kronii)). What followed was a classic bonding session covering truly meaningful topics like siblings, lack of blood relation, and... other vaguely questionable things.

Eventually, after a _lot_ of distractions, she managed to gather enough materials to make a cooking pot and began her culinary career. With Nerissa’s help, she whipped up a few bowls of savory vegetable soup.

She also got wind of the Shiori Nyavella [scam saga](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=toRAAJgyNlb9mNMJ&t=12409) and decided to try selling her goods—right in front of someone else’s shop. Naturally, she was promptly kicked out. Understandably so.

In the end, she opened her own shop—a [pink one](https://www.youtube.com/live/xzAqu4vkY7I?si=4DWyjnCRm8GAkJ9g&t=22870), of course, to match her energy. And finally, with great reluctance, she ended the day by writing her journal. A slightly chaotic, very pink beginning to what was sure to be a memorably unhinged culinary journey.
