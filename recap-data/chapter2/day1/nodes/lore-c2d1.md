#### Main Story

The current setting takes place in Ancient Libestal—a real version of Libestal set far in the past, currently suffering under the ravage of Stains and corruption. As stated in the Book of Prophecies, the world was doomed to fall into this calamity. Its princess, Iphania, now rules the kingdom, pleading with the heroes for their help to save the world.

Fia had summoned the heroes here, revealing the truths behind their previous journey—that it had taken place in a fake, fabricated version of Libestal, created as a prison to contain its false King, known as the Outsider. A being born from hatred, the Outsider, once released, unleashed its rage upon the universe. Now, the heroes—known as the Shining Stars—are asked to retrieve Fia’s missing memories, which contain vital information about the Outsider, in hopes of finding a way to prevent its existence from fully manifesting.

Within this, the Princess mentioned the name of a nameless swordsman, one they referred to as _the Outlander_—an individual on their own mission to save the world from the coming calamity.

#### Uncovered Information

Currently, the heroes are gathering their resources and materials at the Remnants of the Cliffs of Sidero. These remnants are what's left of certain locations in the kingdom before the Stains and corruption spread, forcing its residents to flee and seek refuge elsewhere.

The Cliffs of Sidero were once the site of an ancient expedition led by an explorer who, long before the corruption took hold, ventured deep into the cliffs in search of treasure. One by one, his companions fell away, until he finally discovered what he believed to be the treasure—only to realize they had instead unleashed something terrible: possibly the Stains themselves.
