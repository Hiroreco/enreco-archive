The first thing the blue maiden saw upon waking was a magical talking cat explaining her dire situation and her ultimate mission. And the first thing she did upon seeing said cat? She called it [fat](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=HUKTRLtdetft9DSn&t=554). A flawless introduction.

Tam—or was she Tam? The blue maiden couldn't recall. Her name, her past journey, even her former comrades were but faint echoes in her mind. Foggy, half-remembered fragments. But she didn’t seem to care. As ever, she remained completely deadpan, even in the midst of chaos and confusion.

Others, however, seemed to remember her. Calli was the first to call her by name—Tam Gandr—followed by Gonathon, who felt an odd sense of loyalty toward her (see [Gonathon-Tam: A Sense of Loyalty](#edge:kronii-gigi)). Elizabeth? She straight up remembered Tam, no doubt about it. Even the Hot Pink One chimed in with a nickname of her own (see [Tam-Hot Pink One: Timmy and Pinky](#edge:irys-kronii)).

Strangely enough, Tam became something of a focal point. Perhaps it was the uniqueness of her name—or perhaps something else—but people seemed drawn to her.

And yet, name or no name, the Tam-ness of Tam still shone through. Her signature snark, sharp side comments, and faint air of [superiority](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=vZp0hb6TVjwCsmUK&t=3549) lingered. Once a queen, always a queen… even if no one remembered her reign.


Moving on, when it came time to pick a job, Tam chose to be a Supplier. The idea of gathering materials appealed to her, so she wasted no time getting started. She even managed to trade some of her early findings for a snazzy [hat](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=GRs1MgjdHWSBgNzw&t=8470).

After that, she began building her [abode](https://www.youtube.com/live/9XG91aw1gTo?si=FQg3zwZiabQwSxev&t=12197) and took a little detour to investigate the widely-gossiped "scammer shop" run by none other than Shiori Nyavella. It didn’t go well—Tam unintentionally exposed how broke she was when she couldn't afford a single thing from the shop, even with a discount.

Eventually, Tam settled down to write her journal entry for the Library, reflecting on the bizarre start to her journey and the strange, memorable people she had already encountered.
