Right as she was regaining her composure after a long slumber—ever since the battle against the corrupted King—Elizabeth suddenly found herself thrown into a place that somewhat resembled a library, where a cat named Fia greeted her and explained the current situation.

There was a lot to take in, but one detail stood out to Elizabeth more than anything else: she had been brought back in time to an earlier state of Libestal. Her memories were fractured, and she was told she would need to recover them beyond the kingdom’s walls.

Elizabeth found this peculiar. She could still recall everything—her battles, her comrades, the life she once lived. But not everyone could say the same. When she met Mococo again, the latter didn’t even [recognize her](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=7Td3cbu0PPDJkx27&t=606).

After some discussion about the library's mechanics with Kiara and Calli, Elizabeth eventually met with the Princess, who further clarified the current state of things.

Having had enough of the info dump, Elizabeth’s new journey began. Like everyone else, she needed to learn the ropes of this unfamiliar kingdom. A lot had changed: the guilds were no more, her Jade Sword guildmaster was nowhere to be found, and her former guildmates didn’t even remember her clearly. Her status as a knight who once protected the kingdom no longer held any meaning. Instead, she was told she had to… get a job.

From a noble knight to working minimum wage—what a downgrade. Still, Elizabeth was dutiful, and she took on the challenge. After some thought, she chose to become a smith, even crafting a quirky title for herself to match the role.

But of course, her journey was anything but smooth. Just moments after signing up for her job, the red knight—turned smith—ran into a very familiar face she absolutely did *not* want to see: Tam Gandr. A big meany. However, this time something felt… different.

Tam didn’t seem to remember who Elizabeth was, which strangely delighted the red maiden. The obnoxious, self-proclaimed queen was no more. But fate wasn’t so kind, for there was another blue maiden Elizabeth would've rather remained forgotten (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: She’s jesting, right?](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

Even Elizabeth’s ex-daughter, Koseki Bijou, had no recollection of her. And with that, Elizabeth slowly realized—maybe this wasn’t a joke. Maybe she really *was* one of the few who had retained her memories. Was she sad? Was she shocked? Not really. She just felt… tired. Being thrown back in time, forced to adapt to a new life on the spot, and now the people she once held close couldn’t even remember her? Mentally, it was draining.

Still, she pressed on. Maybe by focusing on her tasks, she could push those feelings aside. That plan didn’t exactly pan out either. Elizabeth was terrible with directions—[*very* terrible](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=y_o1ps5Fsgg5Gp0T&t=2561). While others zipped through their new jobs, she was constantly lost, repeatedly [struggling](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=k7qXNc2nNN22aSHQ&t=3331) to figure out where to go next, to the point she broke character and yelled out in sheer indignation.

Eventually, after taking thousands of misdirected steps, she started to figure things out. Things began to look up. She chatted with [others](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=ECQ3WNgCsEOouRSU&t=4018), cracked some [terrible jokes](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=HRKqbzfBMQze3nLm&t=4666), and discovered that her sword could [shoot fire](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=rj1mAKCPPbUAYG2p&t=4782). She even managed to sneak up on Ina to prank her.

As a smith, her role was to craft and upgrade weapons—both for herself and for others. But Elizabeth, wielder of a massive claymore, was more of a swinger than a maker. The whole smithing thing [confused](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=sigydwBMx8Bvvkd-&t=7247) her, so in the end, she gave up on the job—at least for now.

Instead, she chose to build herself a [humble home](https://www.youtube.com/live/2toZfafpyW8?si=HlRR5c81lqUhhU2P&t=10915). She painted it green, a nod to her days as a Jade Sword member—something small to bring her comfort in a world where most of her friends had forgotten her. And so, her new adventure began, a lonely but determined march through the mystery that is Libestal.
