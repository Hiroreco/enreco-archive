Fragments of Memories, Whispers of Past Deeds and Love

With a flash of light, Gonathon G. once again finds herself whisked back to the land of Libestal. However in a preverse turn of fate, she once again finds herself stripped of her memories, including those of her time in the present and of the ones who were most dear to her.

Thrust into a new quest, Gonathon quickly devoted herself to her new job as a [smithy](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=1679). Ever the generous and humble knight, Gonathon was perhaps [overly generous](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=9555) in giving away the valuable upgrade materials she created. Eventually she established her own smithy and began constructing a tree house next to it.

Throughout her adventures of the day, Gonathon received many flashes of her past memories, which she desperately clung to [despite not understanding what they meant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT2cj934-I&t=7987s). She knew that she had lost something [precious](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=6105), and the lack of clarity frustrated her greatly. Determined to relearn what she had lost, Gonathon became committed to serving the kingdom and its people once again through her smithing.

Along the way, Gonathon bonded with many fellow adventurers, with some seeming to be very familiar. In particular, she learned [the concept of a "dawg"](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=5376), a form of soul bound from Morden Ramsey, and she quickly formed a similar bond with Cecelia Immerkind. Immerkind was quick to provide Gonathon with some words of warning, stating that she should not trust everything she hears and to make decisions for herself.

This mantra would quickly be tested, as Gonathon found herself thrust into many conflicts, particularly a heated exchange between [Morden Ramsey](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=13056) and [Shiori of the Nyavellas](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=12334), with both claiming to be in the right and seeking Gonathon's aid. It was here that Gonathon's truest virtues once again shined through, as she made sure to hear both sides of the story and worked with the two to reach an amicable agreement. 

With the day drawing to a close, Gonathon retired to record her diary for inclusion in the Library. It was here that many of her self-doubts bubbled to the surface.
