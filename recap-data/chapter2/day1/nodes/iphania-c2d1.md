Princess Iphania, in her own right, stood as the ruler of this version of the kingdom of Libestal. Gentle in voice and soft in demeanor, she carried herself with a quiet strength—a kind-hearted soul clinging to hope in a world on the brink of collapse. When the heroes arrived, seemingly from the stars themselves, she looked upon them not with suspicion, but with the belief that they might be the long-awaited miracle.

She laid bare the grim truth of their reality: the world was being devoured by the Ruination, a creeping corruption that turned people into mindless, frenzied shells of who they once were—those marked as “ruin-touched.” It was an affliction without mercy, one that had already claimed countless lives, including her own parents and everyone she once held dear.

According to the Book of Prophecies, the world’s fate was already written. Every disaster, every loss, every soul consumed by the Stains—predicted, expected, unchangeable. It was a prophecy that had never faltered. But when the heroes arrived, something shifted.

For the first time in history, an event occurred that the book did _not_ foresee. Their presence disrupted the script, like a ripple breaking the still surface of fate. And in that moment, Princess Iphania felt something stir within her—a blazing hope that perhaps these Shining Stars were not just a footnote in the final chapter, but the very force that could rewrite the ending.

With that fire in her heart, she gave the heroes one solemn charge:

The world would end in seven days.

And they had seven days to stop it.
