<!-- title: Fia -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Fia was a talking cat-like doll who oversaw the _Library Between Worlds_, a strange yet seemingly all-knowing figure who guided the heroes into this new journey, recalling their previous tales.

She explained that the King they’d served had deceived them; his true identity was the Outsider, a being of rage and hatred, seeking vengeance on those who imprisoned him in the fabricated kingdom of Libestal and yearning to destroy the universe.

As the heroes defeated that great evil, the world began to crumble. To save them, Fia brought them to the Library, traveling back in time to before the Outsider’s existence.

Now, she asked the heroes for their strength to prevent the Outsider’s emergence. However, the time leap had cost her precious memories. With a heartfelt plea, she urged the heroes to recover her memories to save Libestal and the universe.
