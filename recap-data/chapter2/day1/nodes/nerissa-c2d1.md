Try as she might, Nerissa was not to break through the flat-white walls of this endless cage. She had lost her memories — again. Not even the very brief confrontation with her, the one she was once deeply intertwined with, could jog her memory (see: [Elizabeth](#node:liz))

After a sticky situation during her first meeting with [Fia](#node:fia), she convened with the other girls gradually populating the atrium of the Library. The group had a short stint, relating over not remembering their own names, which would ironically be a great icebreaker prompt. She searched for aim between the thousands of books lining the shelves of the Library, acknowledging her presence in the distant past.

She struck up conversation with Shiori of the Nyavella, though “trying to” would be more apt descriptor considering the lively sounds of fifteen voices overlapping within the building. They shared brief banter, before the greater group came together for the debriefing from Mori Calliope and Kiara.

The nameless maiden took interest in learning the crafts of culinary arts to get by throughout the week. She was on the straight and narrow, focusing on exploring the castle grounds as she completed the Princess’ quests. She placed much trust in fellow Chef Mordon Ramsay to save Ancient Libestal, taking in her well-informed advice on the state of the land. She even agreed to become Mordon’s sous chef in her upcoming tavern, such great developments for her budding career.

The woman with crimson hair reappeared, distrusting of her apparent amnesia, to the point of accusing her to be a witch! (see: [Elizabeth-Nerissa: She's jesting, right?](#edge:liz-nerissa-right-2-left-2))

Her path converged again with Shiori (who tried to name her Pickles) and Mordon in the cave of Sidero. As luck would have it, the three of them are fledgling Chefs, setting them up for a fine discussion of the future in the restaurant industry while they gathered precious metals.
