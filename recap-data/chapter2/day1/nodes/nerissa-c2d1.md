Nerissa—if that was even her real name anymore—[remembered nothing](https://www.youtube.com/live/XfZh_3xb7i0?si=4ltg7sRVoTvNszan&t=1063). Not the dying kingdom she had once vowed to save, not the universe hanging by a thread, not even the bonds she once held dear (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa](#edge:liz-nerissa)). Still, something pushed her forward. If nothing else, maybe the path ahead held fragments of who she used to be: her name, her stories, and the hearts she once held close.

With no memory and no grand destiny in mind, she turned to something simpler—something grounding. The [culinary arts](https://www.youtube.com/live/XfZh_3xb7i0?si=pOseYNmId4we0h3f&t=1909). To survive the week, she took up cooking, wandering the castle grounds, helping out with the Princess’s errands, and keeping her head down.

She placed her trust in one particularly loud and passionate fellow Chef—Mordon Ramsay. Despite her... colorful personality, her advice on the state of Ancient Libestal was oddly sound. So much so that she agreed to become her sous chef for the tavern he planned to open. Not bad for someone with no idea who she really was.

In the early days, she went around asking others what her name might be. Suggestions included [“Pickles”](https://www.youtube.com/live/XfZh_3xb7i0?si=LsieHphNAMacw33r&t=2781), [“Mustard”](https://www.youtube.com/live/XfZh_3xb7i0?si=Vfs5XEK6BG2ZsnzT&t=3599), and other bizarre guesses. Thankfully, Elizabeth gave her a name that stuck—**Nerissa**. A small anchor in an ocean of uncertainty.

And so she worked. Hard. Even without memories, her instincts never left her. She cooked (mostly potato salad), gathered ingredients, bonded with other chefs, and built a modest home. She even hung a portrait of herself inside, and set up a small food stall to sell her endless supply of potato salad.

It was a confusing start, no doubt. But gradually, she settled into this new rhythm. And maybe—just maybe—if she kept going, the memories would one day find their way back to her.

And of course, getting swept up in all sorts of shenanigans with the others along the way.
