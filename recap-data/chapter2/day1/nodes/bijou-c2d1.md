<!-- title: Koseki Bijou -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Koseki Bijou, ever innocent, calls herself the princess of the Kingdom of Libestal. She used to call herself the Stain Princess, but those days were over. She vowed to turn over a new leaf to atone for what she had done to her peers.

Sometime after slaying the Captive (now the Outsider), she finds herself in a library like everyone else. A cat named [Fia](#node:fia) tells her and the other heroes that they have been sent back in time to an earlier state of Libestal. The REAL Libestal, not the phony version everyone was once trapped in. While some details are clear as crystal and painful to bear, she had forgotten some details due to the effects of time travel.

She keeps her title more as a formality than a status, wishing to do good in this world to make up for what she had done before. She also remembers things about the other heroes she was once close to. While Ina remembered being her dear sister, the Hot Pink One completely forgot about Bijou and started calling her brother instead (see [Bijou-Hot Pink One: Onii-chan](#edge:irys-bijou))

Princess Bijou quickly realizes she must take up a new lifestyle, as the role of "Princess" is already taken at this point in time. For some of the heroes, this doesn’t mean much more than taking up any old occupation. As a (former) princess who lived as a carefree royal for all her life, Bijou is distraught to become one with the common folk and...

Bijou decided to become a Jeweler—the most natural choice for her, as a rock. She could even take parts of herself apart if she had to. She soon finds company with others who also took up the same role. Roa, a jewel entrepreneur, is quick to bring innocent jewelers like Bijou under her wing as employees for her up-and-coming [business](https://www.youtube.com/live/pEAXwijhfFY?si=pm8ohz6scqKw0s6B&t=2864). Through their partnership, they realize the potential of selling charms to the other heroes.

Our Princess isn’t used to the commoner life. She was once spoiled by being so rich that money was no object to her. The realization of having to make her own money and soiling her hands with hard work was… a foreign concept for her. Nonetheless, she forged on, determined to build her business. ["Princesses don't earn, they receive!"](https://youtu.be/pEAXwijhfFY?t=6275)

Late into the day, Bijou would be the only jeweler left. Several of the heroes would come to her to buy one or more charms for their own adventures, letting her rake in the cash. Between this and completing a lot of side quests, she could get used to this!

...Perhaps avoid doing business underwater, though, lest you drown in the process.

The rest of her day is spent building what will become the establishment for her charm business with Roa and the other jewelers. IRyS keeps her company as she builds her house nearby.

Oh, and lava chicken.
