<!-- title: Tanakisha Karia -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Tanakisha Karia—or rather, Kiara Takahashi—had her memories returned, though some parts remained a blur. What happened in the end? A fierce battle of epic proportions?

The mystery didn't last long as a [voice](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=471) reminded her.

She told Kiara of the Outsider who tricked everyone into freeing him. How his hate would consume millions of worlds if not stopped. Thankfully, there was a way to stop him.

Kiara soon found herself in a strange Library, one caught between time and space. A mysterious librarian, [Fia](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=753), explained who the Outsider is, how the Libestal they knew was but a mirage, and the key to the Outsider's defeat. Unfortunately, the latter is unknown as Fia's memories were also lost. In order to save the world, Kiara must bravely venture back to Ancient Libestal and find everyone's memories.

With that in mind, Kiara and Mori Calliope (also known as Mordan Ramsey) were designated as the official Lorekeepers of the Library and relayed their mission to their fellow heroes. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, Kiara spoke of keeping a journal daily to record the events so nothing goes amiss.

With hope in their hearts, they all set forth towards their adventures, soon meeting the last Royal of Libestal, [Princess Iphania](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=1374). The Princess told a tale of how Ruination had destroyed her kingdom and family, how a Book of Prophecies foretold the end of everything in seven days. Though the brave Princess does not know whether or not Kiara's mission would align with her own, she allows the heroes to stay in the kingdom to prepare.

Despite her overqualifications to be a chef, Kiara decided that being a smith would benefit her in the long run. With her prowess and her sword, being a smith will only lead to this beautiful Knight becoming stronger.

After slight difficulty in reading the map—the effects of time travel still lingered—Kiara eventually made her way and soon heard word of Stains roaming the kingdom and left to vanquish them. On the way there, Kiara found Elizabeth and was relieved to see that she too recalled their previous adventure.

[Lost in only direction](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=2908)—but never in heart. Kiara eventually made her way to the Remnants, and before she could procure the materials essential to a smith, she must first take care of the Stains. Hard fought, almost defeated, but by the timely appearance of others, they secured a safe victory.

Along the way, Kiara met many of her companions. Though perplexed by the youths of today, who seemed to prefer speaking through the floor. Kiara made wonderful connections, such as forming a kindred spirit with fellow orange smith Gonathon and finding a possible cousin with Cecilia Immerkind due to the common language they speak and a mutual appreciation for kindness (see [Kiara-Cecilia](#edge:cecilia-kiara)).

Focusing on the quests beforehand to prepare for the coming days, Kiara gained more experience as a smith and began trading her goods with others free of charge, for her Noble Spirit as a Knight shines ever bright. Not everyone is in agreement with Kiara's ideals, as Roa Pandora and her employees, the former Princess Bijou and Mococo, enforced [capitalistic ideals](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=9621). Against all odds, and perhaps due to Kiara's kind nature, she may have convinced Bijou that fairer trades could be made—not just ones with gold.

Soon, Elizabeth calls Kiara to the building area, a large plot of land that our heroes are free to use as they see fit, and shows her the beginnings of their shop. Kiara [marveled](https://www.youtube.com/live/5pgqtkxazUo?si=7diOGxuprXPr80Zl&t=11622) at the craftsmanship Elizabeth showed but was appalled that the other knight was too humble, leaving herself only the area under the stairs to rest, and insisted they share the upper floor.

A knight's and hero's work is never done, especially as the deadline looms. Tired, Kiara writes in her journal before departing to rest, pondering what tomorrow could bring.
