Tanakisha Karia, or rather, Kiara Takahashi's memories returned though some parts remained a blur. What happened in the end? A fierce battle of epic proportions?

The mystery didn't last long as a [voice](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=471) reminds her.

She told Kiara of The Outsider who tricked everyone into freeing him. How his hate would consume millions of other worlds if not stopped. Thankfully, there is a way.

Kiara soon found herself in a strange Library, one caught between worlds and of time and space. A mysterious librarian brought her, and others, here. [Fia](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=753) explained who The Outsider is, how the Libestal they knew was but a Mirage, and the key to The Outsider's defeat. Unfortunately, the latter is unknown as Fia's memories are also lost. In order to save the world, Kiara must bravely venture back to Ancient Libestal and find everyone's memories.

With that in mind, Kiara and Mori Calliope (Also known as Morden Ramsay) were designated as the official Lorekeepers of The Library and relayed their mission to their fellow heroes. To ensure that everything goes smoothly, Kiara spoke of keeping a journal daily and to record the events so nothing goes amiss.

With hope in their hearts, they all set forth towards their adventures soon meeting the last Royal of Libestal, [Princess Iphania](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=1374). The Princess told a tale of how Ruination has destroyed her kingdom and family, how a Book of Prophecies foretold the end of everything in 7 days. Though the brave Princess does not know whether or not Kiara's mission would align with her own, she allows the heroes to stay in the kingdom to prepare.

Despite her overqualifications to be a chef, Kiara decided that being a smithy would benefit her in the long run. With her prowess with her sword, being a smithy will only lead to this beautiful Knight in becoming stronger.

After slight difficulty in reading the map, the effects of time travelling lingered, Kiara eventually made her way and soon heard word of Stains roaming the kingdom and soon left to vanquish them. On the way look for the quest, Kiara found Elizabeth and is relieved to see that she too recalled their previous adventure.

[Lost in only directions](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=2908) but never in heart Kiara eventually made her way to the Remnants and before she could procure the materials essential to smithy jobs, must first take care of the Stains. Hard fought, almost defeated but by the timely appearance of others, they secured a safe victory.

Along the way, Kiara met many of her companions. Though perplexed by the youths of today who would rather speak through the floors, the concept of 'dawg's - Kiara made wonderful connections, such as forming a kindred spirit with fellow orange smithy Gonathan and finding a possible cousin with Cecilia Immerkind due to the common language they speak and an appreciation for kindness.

Focusing on the quests beforehand to prepare for the coming days, Kiara gained more experience as a smithy and began trading her goods with others free of charge, for her Noble Spirit as a Knight shines ever bright. Not everyone is in agreement with Kiara's ideals as Rao Pandora and her employees, the former Princess Bijou and Mococo, enforces the [Capitalistic ideals](https://youtu.be/5pgqtkxazUo?t=9621) even possibly persuading Ina. Against all odds, and perhaps due to Kiara's kind nature, she may have convinced Bijou that fairer trades could be made - not just ones by gold.

Soon, Elizabeth calls Kiara to the building area, a generous place that our heroes are free to use as they see fit, and shows her the beginnings of their shop. Kiara marvelled at the craftsmanship Elizabeth showed but is appalled that the other knight was too humble, giving herself only the sparsest of places to rest and insisted they share the upper floor.

A knight and hero's work is far from over as the deadline looms over their heads. Tired, Kiara writes down on her journals before departing to rest, pondering on what the next day could bring.
