While everyone around her was confused and panicking—grappling with the fact that they'd lost parts of their memories once more—the pink ex-tavern owner stood calmly. Why? Because she remembered everything. More importantly, she had been tasked by a certain important someone—Fia—alongside Kiara, to oversee operations at the Library. That made her feel special. She was the main character now. Probably.

And with that self-appointed title came great responsibility: explaining to the others what was happening, what to do, and how to go about it. You know, main character things. She carried herself with pride… which only made the looks she got from others more awkward—especially after she loudly introduced herself as _Mordan Ramsey_.

Regardless, her new journey had to begin. Having been a cook before, it was no surprise that Calli chose to become a [chef](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=vJIwAPJzVnd5H6Yo&t=1666) again. As for the world-saving stuff—how she was one of the “Shining Stars” destined to rescue the universe? Yeah, no one really cared about that. Mordan Ramsey was here to cook, and cook she shall.

She quickly befriended her new (or were they old?) comrades, including the likes of Gonathon (see [Calli-Gonathon: My Dawg](#edge:calli-gigi)). She had a lot of “dawgs.” She formed bonds with [fellow chefs](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=3GeaCgPBFqQL-cAU&t=3179), started questing, and got used to the mechanics of the new kingdom.

With the basics out of the way, she turned to her true ambition: [opening a shop](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=Y4GcVRFhNDwNYn6w&t=4391)—again. But this time, it would be grander. Better. More delicious food. More divorce services. More charging married couples exorbitant fees. And this time… maybe even a few employees. Her last tavern was built with a green theme to reflect the Jade Sword colors, but since guilds were no longer a thing, she pivoted. Maybe bricks this time—for that solid, grounded, “no tax fraud here” look.

Then came the masterstroke: a secret underground fight club basement. She called it _Dawg Pound_.

A place for others to throw hands in the name of glory (and entertainment), while the soundtrack was none other than [“Lava Chicken”](https://www.youtube.com/live/aqhG1kmmkec?si=xfsHwyAD0T8QPExJ&t=12501) sung by Koseki Bijou. Calli, of course, would be sitting pretty, raking in the profits as the crowd roared.

It was thrilling. She got straight to work laying the foundation—literally—for the Dawg Pound, pushing aside all that “save the world” and “recover your memories” stuff. Journals? Nah. Fight club first. Priorities. And in true Calli fashion, she was locked in.

Before, well, others planned on ruining her business
