Shiori Nyavella learned about the universe being in danger, the loss of memories, being chosen as a hero, all that usual spiel—and promptly decided it was far too boring. Naturally, her first instinct was to drown herself.

...Unsurprisingly, she failed.

This was classic Shiori: defying expectations, doing everything on her own terms—even if it meant risking the safety of the world, unsettling those around her, or earning the label of "freak." Choosing a job like everyone else? No thanks. Supplier? Too bland. Jeweler? Too bougie. Even if the ruler of the kingdom got on her knees and begged, Shiori would have happily remained unemployed. But alas, society always had a way of forcing her hand. Begrudgingly, she chose to be a Chef—not because of any altruistic desire to feed the people, but because it gave her the perfect excuse to [poison](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=XKamh_0_UlRKCyzN&t=1816) them. A true hero.

Thus began the tale of perhaps the most dangerous chef the kingdom had ever seen. One who casually referred to a random woman as [Pickle](https://www.youtube.com/live/zCWoxMbOZPk?si=5acuSuxcDzRRtjdl&t=2667), spoke freely of burying gold and breeding pigs, and generally operated in ways no one could predict. And yes—she cooked. A lot.

To everyone’s shock (and mild horror), Shiori turned out to be exceptionally good at it. She cooked up a storm and hit over 1500 coins before anyone could blink. But for Shiori, it wasn’t enough. A new idea took root—not opening her own shop (too much effort), but rather, what if she... sold her goods on *someone else’s* shop?

And so the Oreo Maiden’s devious schemes began. The unfortunate target? Whichever poor soul owned the establishment she decided to “borrow”.

In no time at all, Shiori transformed from misunderstood oddball to infamous kingdom scammer, surpassing even the speed record previously held by FaunaMart. Her notoriety spread far and wide, reaching even the ears of reclusive figures like Tam Gandr, who typically couldn’t be bothered with trivial social noise.

All in all, a flawless start to her new culinary life of chaos.
