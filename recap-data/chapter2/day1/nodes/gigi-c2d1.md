**Fragments of Memories, Whispers of Past Deeds, and Love**

With a flash of light, Gonathon G. once again found himself whisked back to the land of Libestal. However, in a perverse turn of fate, he was stripped of his memories, including those of his time in the present and of those most dear to him.

Thrust into a new quest, Gonathon quickly devoted himself to his new job as a [smith](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=1679). Ever the generous and humble knight, Gonathon was perhaps [overly generous](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=9555) in giving away the valuable upgrade materials he created. Eventually, he established his smithy and began constructing a tree house next to it.

Throughout his adventures, Gonathon received many flashes of his past, which he desperately clung to [despite not understanding what they meant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT2cj934-I&t=7987s). He knew that he had lost something [precious](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=6105), and the lack of clarity frustrated him greatly. Determined to relearn what he had lost, Gonathon became committed to serving the kingdom and its people once again through his smithing.

Along the way, Gonathon bonded with many fellow adventurers, with some seeming to be very familiar. In particular, he learned [the concept of a "dawg,"](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=5376) a form of soul bond from Mordan Ramsey, and he quickly formed a similar bond with Cecilia Immerkind. Immerkind was quick to provide Gonathon with some words of warning, stating that he should not trust everything he hears and should make decisions for himself.

This mantra would quickly be tested, as Gonathon found himself thrust into many conflicts, in a particularly heated exchange between [Mordan Ramsey](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=13056) and [Shiori of the Nyavellas](https://youtu.be/CPT2cj934-I?t=12334), with both claiming to be in the right and seeking Gonathon's aid. It was here that Gonathon's truest virtues once again shone through, as he made sure to hear both sides of the story and worked with the two to reach an amicable agreement.

With the day drawing to a close, Gonathon retired to record his diary for inclusion in the Library. It was here that his self-doubt bubbled to the surface.
