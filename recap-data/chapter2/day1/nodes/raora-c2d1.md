Roa Pandora enters the job hall, where she eagerly accepts the job of [jeweler](https://www.youtube.com/live/zmRDeC_aJUM?si=jFDNWI_EmN9S-nyd&t=1890). She continues exploring the castle where she engages in conversation with other Shining Stars like Fuwawa, Mococo, Princess Bijou, and others. She takes Mococo and Princess Bijou under her wing as they seek to start a business together. They then depart for the Remnants in order to secure resources for their business venture.

Roa runs into Lady Bloodflame, who calls her "Queen Mario," sending her into a deep moment of contemplation. Mococo attempts to comfort Roa with headpats to help her feel better. Bijou also checks in on her boss from her crash out.

Pandora continues to engage with Lady Bloodflame, curious about the [mysterious air](https://www.youtube.com/live/zmRDeC_aJUM?si=lv4_37Z3C-neG7Fs&t=6615) about her and the knowledge of her past. After Roa departs, she receives a call from Bijou, who tells her about a very important [business proposition](https://www.youtube.com/live/zmRDeC_aJUM?si=FyLgQ_zBtSf6EpCZ&t=7104).

Roa, Bijou, and Mococo begin to sell their wares to various people, as demand is high—even though their business model is questionable. They also try to rope NinoIna into their monopoly. They [haggle](https://www.youtube.com/live/zmRDeC_aJUM?t=10740s) over a price to bring her on board—at the cost of going broke.

Roa concludes her day with a heartfelt call with her employee Bijou.
