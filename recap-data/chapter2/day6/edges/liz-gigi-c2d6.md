The Knights’ Heartache

Among all of Gonathon’s companions, Elizabeth had proven the most stalwart and dependable, seemingly never veering from the knight’s code. Today though would prove to be the first time a chink would appear in her armor in the eyes of the humble knight, but would this be enough to foster distrust?

The two knights ventured into the Mysterious Tome quest together, with their wits and bond allowing them to lead their companions to victory. Walking together following their victory, the two encountered Nerissa Ravencroft, whom Liz desired to spar with. Although the raven witch offered for Gonathon to accompany them, a [feeling deep inside the humble knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=4864s) told her it was better to give them some time alone, and proclaimed she would meet with her fellow knight later.

Soon after, Liz would request Gonathon’s aid in an urgent matter. A strange music had been seeping out from underneath her forge, and she was unsure of its origin. The keen-eyed junior knight quickly discovered a secret passage underneath the Jade Forge, one emblazoned with a mural of Nerissa (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)). There, the knights and Roa discovered a chest containing a poem, one that appeared to be significant to the scarlet knight. Liz further showed off her [LOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=7601s): Liz Out of Office, but grew defensive when asked why there was only one bed. Leaving Liz to ponder the poem they found, Gonathon was unaware that the next time they would speak would be under very different circumstances.

While Gonathon assisted Immerkind with her troubles (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Knight at Home with the Wolves](#edge:cecilia-gigi)), the scarlet knight made a disturbing discovery: that Nerissa had been given memories by Shiori of the Nyavellas that appeared to portray Elizabeth jailing the raven witch. Enraged by what she perceived to be a falsified memory, Elizabeth confronted Shiori and, realizing her connection to Gonathon put the humble knight in danger, [called Gonathon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9409s) and informed her of Shiori’s deeds. 

Gonathon now stood very conflicted. On the one hand, she deeply trusted her fellow knight and saw no reason why she would falsely accuse Shiori. But on the other hand, she could not bring herself to suspect Shiori, and could not help but question exactly what Liz was up to and why she only had a single bed for her LOO. Gonathon, Tam Gandr, and Immerkind all agreed to [confront](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12902s) Liz and determine once and for all what motivated the stalwart knight’s heart.
