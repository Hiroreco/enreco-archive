In a sea of dramatic and trauma-afflicted companions, the curious NinoIna served as an eccentric but comforting presence for the weary Gonathon G. Upon every meeting, the two would touch potatoes and ponder the simple things in life. Today, they ventured together to collect materials to prepare for the upcoming final dungeon: The Heart of Ruin. It was during their questing that perhaps their most peculiar conversation took place: about what future chapters lay in store for them, and just how many chapters they would have to endure.

How many more stories would they have to live through before things returned to normal? Four? Ten? Sixty? Some guesses were half-serious, others purely in jest. But the questions lingered longer than expected. What would all of this mean, in the end? Would their adventures be remembered? Would they even remember them? Had it all been worth it? Were they happy to have come this far?

Ever since the beginning, things had moved so quickly—battles fought, bonds forged, loss endured—that none of them had really paused to reflect. And so, even if just for a moment, this brief exchange between two peculiar souls offered something rare: a quiet contemplation amid the chaos.

A fleeting pause to wonder what any of it truly meant.

A gentle reminder that behind the shenanigans and the scars, there were still people simply trying to make sense of their journey.
