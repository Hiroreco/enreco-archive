<!-- title: A Knight's Love -->

One day became two, two turned to three, and now, it had been six long, hope-filled days since Cecilia first laid eyes on the Princess. Six days where the glimmer in her eyes had never dulled, not even for a moment. She had given her all—every breath, every thought, every ounce of strength—just for a chance to remain by the Princess's side. She shielded her, fulfilled her wishes, and held steadfast even when the Princess's heart seemed to wander elsewhere, most often toward the Outlander.

But today… today, emotions could no longer be held back.

Instrument in hand, heart on sleeve, Cecilia chose to bare it all. No more subtle gestures. No more waiting. She poured herself into a song.

A song for her Princess.
A song from the Knight’s aching heart.

A confession woven not in words alone, but in trembling notes and heartfelt lyrics. The tremor in her voice made every line land deeper. It wasn’t just a song—it was a love letter born of six days of devotion, adoration, and quiet heartbreak.

And the Princess responded.

Cecilia gasped—perhaps in joy, in disbelief. It was something, wasn't it? The Princess said she saw something _special_ in her. That meant something… right? Surely that wasn’t a phrase she handed out like candy… right?

...Right?

But the truth hit, slowly at first, then all at once. The response wasn’t what Cecilia had hoped for. It wasn’t rejection, no… but it wasn’t confirmation either. And as doubts began to pool in her heart, it was Bijou and Gonathon who spoke the words she couldn’t bring herself to say. Words that made it clear the Princess hadn’t understood the depth of what Cecilia had offered her.

That was when the dam broke.

Tears flowed—not from weakness, but from the raw weight of unreciprocated love.

Still, amidst her sorrow, her friends were there. Bijou, Gonathon—unwavering, grounding her, giving her the strength to rise again. And rise she did (see [Cecilia-Bijou](#edge:cecilia-bijou) and [Gonathon-Cecilia](#edge:cecilia-gigi)).

Two days remained.

And in those two days, Cecilia would wait—for an answer, for hope, for the love she still so desperately wished to be returned.
