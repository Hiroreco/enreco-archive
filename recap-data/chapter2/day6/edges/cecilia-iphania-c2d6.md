<!-- title: A Knights Love -->

The knight sings.

The knight departs, patiently awaiting an answer. She does not hurry the princess. She does not pressure her. The knight continues their duties to the princess, her friends, and the kingdom.

We know not what will happen in 2 days, but we know that Knight Immerkind will love her without strings.
