Realizing that even after pouring her entire heart out—after every gesture, every word, every hopeful glance toward the Princess—Cecilia was met with silence, the cold sting of indifference. Maybe the Princess never saw her that way. Maybe she never would. After six days of aching hope, the truth hit her like a blade: all her feelings may have been one-sided.

And once again, as if fate had him on standby, Gonathon was there.

The Green Knight, usually so composed, crumbled—tears streaming, heartbreaking, all hope slipping away. Others tried to comfort her, offered gentle words, and told her what she wanted to hear. But Gonathon? Gonathon cut through it all with honesty. No false hope, no sugarcoating—just a raw, steady reminder that he wouldn’t let her drown in this sadness again. Not this time. Not after everything.

"Bro tug before hoes tug," the words didn’t need to be poetic—they just needed to be real.

And with a little help from Bijou’s unshakable cheer, Cecilia began to breathe again. The fog lifted, and, if only just a little, the weight began to ease.

And then, not long after, the green one turned around and offered the same emotional support right back to the orange one.

Turns out, sometimes, the best cure for a breaking heart is a fellow disaster who knows how to hold yours together. These two? Definitely each other’s designated emotional support gremlins.
