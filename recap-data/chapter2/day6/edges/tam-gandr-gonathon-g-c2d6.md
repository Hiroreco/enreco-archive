<!-- title: Passed Pawn -->

Following the previous day's dizzying conclusion, Tam and Gonathon’s first exchange of the day was relatively simple, with the knight kneeling before her queen and quickly deflecting a question about the queen’s state of mind from Immerkind. The two parted to assist their parties in the Mysterious Tome quest, during which a jovial Tam Gandr proudly proclaimed that Gonathon was [a truly great companion](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=1755) (this was quickly misinterpreted by her party members as Tam praising Gonathon as a good pet). 

Destiny would not keep the queen and knight apart for long, as Gonathon once again offered to assist Tam in winning the music disk from Star Site: Chaos. Initially reluctant to attempt the dungeon once more due to past traumatic attempts, Gonathon insisted that things would be different this time. This [promise held true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12168s), as the humble knight and the party would easily win the prize the queen had sought. 

From here, intrigue would once again spark to life as Gonathon, Tam, and Immerkind would cram themselves into a [closet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=12291s) to discuss an important matter: that Elizabeth had reason to believe Shiori of the Nyavellas was peddling false memories. By this point, Tam had become deeply protective of her knight and indignant towards Shiori’s apparent manipulations, and she strongly insisted that the trio side with Liz. Gonathon, on the other hand, was not so sure, and finding themselves at an impasse (and following yet another instance of Gonathon seeking to spare Tam further embarrassment of HPO’s misdeeds), the three retired to write their journals.

They were stopped from doing so, however, by the wily Shiori, whose questions concerning Immerkind potentially dating Fia spiraled into a deranged and highly philosophical discussion on one’s state of being, the sense of self, and the meaning of love. When Shiori called upon Gonathon to inspect the party site, Tam was insistent on accompanying her knight. And when Shiori had finished presenting her bargain with Gonathon (see [Gonathon-Shiori: A Memory for a Memory, a Pearl for a Pearl](#edge:gonathon-g-shiori-nyavella-top-2-bottom-1)), Tam confronted her knight once more. Having witnessed the extent of Shiori’s apparently machinations, the queen stated in no uncertain terms [her belief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15572s) that the witch was manipulating and toying with the kind knight’s heart, just as she had done with others. Realizing that Gonathon had made up her mind about Shiori, a defeated Tam shared a tender moment with her loyal retainer, expressing a belief that at the very least, they would see the day through together.
