<!-- title: Roa's Not-Beach Day Episode! -->

Every anime worth its salt (or not) must have an episode were the heroes we hold dear have a moment of levity from the perils of their journey or the conspiracies that hid just around the corner.

For Roa, that not-so-beach day is today!

Most of her day revolved around the Red Knight as Roa constantly sought her out for ['dates'](https://www.youtube.com/live/E-LGNO7JdO4?si=Vbk-LL3ZgXoCA7FR&t=752), trying to catch Elizabeth's interest.

Lady Bloodflame herself seemed to be the dense protagonist, wondering why Roa was upset at times and not realising the CEO's more than platonic intent.

From being hilariously stranded at the edge of the world together to quietly slipping Elizabeth a charm as a token of appreciation, things had taken a surprising turn. The day bloomed into something that closely resembled... well, a real date. A soft, gentle, [blushing](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=1970) kind of day—one that felt like it had been plucked straight from a storybook.

A glowing moon lit the field while the stars above glowed with delight. An objectively beautiful scene with [a Mysterious Fish](https://www.youtube.com/live/E-LGNO7JdO4?si=nE8smmbOvqAwDw-Y&t=2017) drowning in the background.

Elizabeth would then take Roa to see her new LOOO (Liz's Out of Office), a rather comfortable bedroom-office. Roa was admired when a melody started playing.

Then, there was _that_ moment—tender, quiet—where it seemed like Roa might actually confess. Her voice nearly cracked under the weight of her heart, but just before the words could leave her lips, she held back. Still, the feeling lingered in the air, unmistakable.

For the first time in what felt like forever, the pink maiden's heart dared to hope. Maybe, just maybe, her affections were finally reaching the fiery knight who unknowingly lit up her world each time she drew near.

It was romantic at first, but then the moment would ultimately be ruined by then mention of Nerissa's gifts.

The jealousy finally culminated, erupting from Roa as she demanded that Elizabeth put the gifts back, reminding Elizabeth that Nerissa is a witch. Roa would run away in tears and spend her time in the Remnant fields. There, she swore to earn the gold, 5000 coins to buy a gift for Elizabeth, and confess her feelings. It was an endless battle. Stain after Stain, Roa unleashed all her frustrations against those who stood in the way of her love.

But through her pain, and through Bijou's busy phone, Roa planned to bring Elizabeth here, to the top of the remnant field, confess her feelings.

In another turn of clichéd events, Elizabeth was suddenly nearby. Worried about how Roa had suddenly left, Elizabeth had informed Roa that she put back the items in Nerissa's spot, and Roa immediately took the opportunity.

Three legendary charms for a Legendary Knight. Roa apologised as well, for running suddenly, which Elizabeth immediately said she understood. Roa told Elizabeth to remember her when she fights with her charms, that they would watch her in Roa's place. Touched, Elizabeth called Roa her shield... When the moment was ruined by the [music playing](https://www.youtube.com/live/E-LGNO7JdO4?si=DgHG-DiRuKREWsD8&t=9048).

The beach episode was, by all accounts, a success—romantic tension, heartfelt gestures, and a parade of [stalkers](https://www.youtube.com/live/E-LGNO7JdO4?si=EQ2i5tfeEEHauBZz&t=10780) lurking in the backdrop.

Though she could not fully confession her feelings, perhaps if the tide remained kind, tomorrow would be the day Roa finds the courage to finally say what she's been holding in for so long.
