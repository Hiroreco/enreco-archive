<!-- title: Roa's Not-Beach Day Episode! -->

Every anime worth its salt (or not) must have an episode were the heroes we hold dear have a moment of levity from the perils of their journey or the conspiracies that hid just around the corner.

For Roa, that not-so-beach day is today!

Most of her day revolved around the Red Knight as Roa constantly sought her out for ['dates'](https://www.youtube.com/live/E-LGNO7JdO4?si=Vbk-LL3ZgXoCA7FR&t=752), trying to catch Elizabeth's interest.

Lady Bloodflame herself seemed to be the dense protagonist, wondering why Roa was upset at times and not realising the CEO's more than platonic intent.

From being hilariously stranded at the edge of the world together (with [Bijou](https://www.youtube.com/live/E-LGNO7JdO4?si=md1CqrAjMtYL7qrS&t=2017) as their third wheel) to quietly slipping Elizabeth a charm as a token of appreciation, things had taken a surprising turn. The day bloomed into something that closely resembled... well, a real date. A soft, gentle, blushing kind of day—one that felt like it had been plucked straight from a storybook.

There was even _that_ moment—tender, quiet—where it seemed like Roa might actually confess. Her voice nearly cracked under the weight of her heart, but just before the words could leave her lips, she held back. Still, the feeling lingered in the air, unmistakable.

For the first time in what felt like forever, the pink maiden's heart dared to hope. Maybe, just maybe, her affections were finally reaching the fiery knight who unknowingly lit up her world each time she drew near.

The beach episode was, by all accounts, a success—romantic tension, heartfelt gestures, and a parade of [stalkers](https://www.youtube.com/live/E-LGNO7JdO4?si=md1CqrAjMtYL7qrS&t=2017) lurking in the backdrop.

And perhaps, if the tide remained kind, tomorrow would be the day Roa finds the courage to finally say what she's been holding in for so long.
