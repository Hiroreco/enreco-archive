<!-- title: Roa's Not-Beach Day Episode! -->

Every anime worth its salt (or not) must have an episode were the heroes we hold dear have a moment of levity from the perils of their journey or the conspiracies that hid just around the corner.

For Roa, that not-so-beach day is today!

Most of her day revolved around the Red Knight as Roa constantly sought her out for 'dates', trying to catch Elizabeth's interest.

Lady Bloodflame herself seemed to be the dense protagonist, wondering why Roa was upset at times and not realising the CEO's more than platonic intent.

From being comically stuck at the edge of the world together (plus Bijou) to giving Elizabeth's charms to show her appreciation, to *a tender moment where it seemed Roa was almost about to confess but changed her mind*, it seemed Day 6 had it all. Even a love rival present through Nerissa's efforts to win Lady Bloodflame herself.

Though the day did not end in Roa's favor, the two shared a special bond... Along with Cecilia Immerkind and Gonathan with a G.


Perhaps tomorrow might be a better day for Roa. She already bought the ring, of course.
