**A PRIZE ON THE LINE**

With a prize up for grabs, Nerissa knew she had to win the spar. All she had to do was defend until an opportunity came up to strike. She felt ready to go with her shield raised and blade in her hand.

But two fights left her with losses, and she had only one more chance to claim this unknown prize. Despite Elizabeth’s combat-ready skills as a knight, Nerissa struck her down without so much as a single mark left on the Witch.

With a laugh and praise, Elizabeth initiated a trade, passing over the [gorgeous ring](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=mzKgTVgZtwUq3Rxv&t=20334) she had purchased earlier in the day. Now, she had reason to give it along with a few excuses.

**A NOBLE KNIGHT'S STAY**

With victory achieved and a loss gained, there are talks of the Knight’s Suite as a prize for a sparring tournament. The very gift Nerissa secretly gave to Elizabeth. But it becomes painfully evident that Elizabeth has no idea the size of this room or that it’s not a room intended for sparring.

Quickly, they make haste to Mordan Ramsey’s hotel to [inspect the room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=20591s) itself. Elizabeth is disappointed that it’s not what she reasonably expected. However, Nerissa and Elizabeth let their worries go as they embraced their inner child. Both jump on the bed before deciding it's best to stop before they break it.

**I'LL PROTECT YOU**

Worry. Concern. Fear.

A painting moved without a reason or an idea of who could have done it.

Mysterious music and ticking sounds were heard around the shop.

Books of confusion, feeling, and poetry are hidden behind Nerissa’s painting.

None of it sits well with the Jade Knight. Elizabeth turns to Nerissa and requests that she [stay in her LOO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=22594s) for this night. Not to be alone.

“Stay safe, okay?”

A simple request for an unknown threat.

Or perhaps the danger is right before the knight. Reflected in red eyes and odd intonations

**VERUM VOLUMEN**

What exactly were their past identities? Their previous relationship? If Elizabeth was so insistent on Nerissa being a witch, was she actually one? Had Nerissa done something evil to the knight, so that her hatred transcended along with her in the present?

The growing curiosity of the black-haired maiden urged her to consult the memory of the other witch, Shiori of the Nyavella, whom she had commissioned a day ago to write something for her. Whether it was trustworthy or not, it did not matter. She had to cling onto something…

She promised that she would read it together with the fair knight, however, just to have some form of solace, she’d take a peek. And thus she [read](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=13021)…

The contents of the scroll told of a tale of a Knight and a Ravened one; the Knight accusing the Raven maiden, a witch, of presumably bewitching and casting hexes upon her. The Ravened One denied the allegations, citing she had only been kind to the rosen maiden; yet her words had fallen on deaf ears as the knight remained true to her resolve. She locked the witch away… in a cellar, where no one could hear her song apart from another prisoner…

Troubled by such a story, she [called](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=13185) upon Lady Bloodflame, perhaps to inquire if she remembered any of it… if there was any truth to it. The fair knight, having received the call, made haste and read the same words written in the scroll.

Confused, she denied it was factual and accused Shiori of telling lies. Indeed, there was no way she could do such a thing to her, could she? Even Nerissa believed she was a kind knight– a soldier of justice. She would make sure a just and fair trial had been put into place before she could pass judgment, surely? 

The two hoped it was just make-believe... a figment of Shiori of the Nyavella’s imagination.

**THE OMEN**

Overall, it had been quite a fun day… as they were able to spend time together and rekindle their relationship. Partly oblivious to the truth, they [slept](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=16262) the night together in Elizabeth’s quarters. The morrow shall be a good one…

… Yet there lay the ominous books behind the portrait of the “witch”... seemingly foreboding of death and loss.

Was it a prophecy? Or a retelling of the past? A mere fiction perhaps? We have yet to find out….
