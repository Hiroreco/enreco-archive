<!-- title: Emotional Support Chibi-Hime -->

Bijou had already done so much for Cecilia throughout this journey—quietly, consistently. From lending her coin to handing over rare materials to even gifting her the [charms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I75IWfMGVgM&t=6558) that helped her overcome the Outlander… which, when you thought about it, was kind of ironic. Wasn’t Cecilia supposed to be _Bijou’s_ knight—the one doing the protecting and supporting? Well, the roles were clearly flipped, but hey—whatever worked.

Today proved that Bijou’s strengths extended far beyond material support.

At Cecilia’s lowest—heart shattered, love unreturned, spirit broken—it was Bijou who stood by her side (with Gonathon too, of course), offering not just comfort, but reassurance. For someone so small, so bubbly, Bijou carried a quiet gravity, a gentleness that could reach past all the noise and pull someone back from their worst thoughts.

She didn’t try to fix everything. She didn’t say what Cecilia wanted to hear—she said what she needed.

And just like that, the Green Knight began to breathe again.

Turns out, this little gem princess wasn’t just precious in name. She really was a jewel of emotion—radiant, steady, and far more brilliant than anyone gave her credit for.
