<!-- title: A Memory for a Memory, a Pearl for a Pearl -->

While Gonathon and Shiori were now on better footing than a day prior, a haze of tension continued to envelope the witch and knight. As with many of her companions, Gonathon’s first interactions with Shiori involved assisting her with upgrades and preparation, in this case, farming [enigmatic stones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=2465s). Before departing for the Cursed Tome event, Shiori requested Gonathon’s assistance with setting up an End of the World Party, which Gonathon happily agreed to help with.

The two would part ways for a while, with Shiori working on the party site and Gonathon assisting Immerkind with her romantic woes (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Knight at Home with the Wolves](#edge:cecilia-gigi)). It was during this time that Shiori would be confronted by Elizabeth. The scarlet knight had become enraged over the memories Shiori had sold, which she felt were fabricated. Now believing Shiori to be a scammer and manipulator, she becomes the most recent of many friends to warn Gonathon of her intentions. Immerkind, too, pleaded with Gonathon not to trust the witch, proclaiming her to be toxic and using the humble knight. Gonathon, not sure what to make of these accusations, explained that she and Shiori were on [neutral terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9716s), but lingering in such a state did not feel right.

Conflicted over whether to believe her knightly mentor or the recalcitrant witch, Gonathon concluded that Liz deserved to be heard out and relayed her words to Tam Gandr (see: [Gonathon-Kronii: Passed Pawn](#edge:kronii-gigi)) and Immerkind. Unsure of Shiori’s intentions, but certain that Liz had no reason to lie, the three agreed to confront the red knight and witch. They needn’t wait long to hear Shiori’s side, for the two-toned witch invited the trio to the party site to talk.

While the chief concerns of the gathering at first seemed to revolve around Shiori potentially being pregnant with Gonathon’s child following their hand-holding incident, Shiori’s actual reason for calling Gonathon went far deeper than any physical relationship. Pulling Gonathon aside and bathed in the moon’s radiant warmth, Shiori asked Gonathon about her Pearl and offered Gonathon a seemingly [simple choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=14956s): in exchange for a complete and clear snippet of a memory of her Pearl, Shiori’s memory of Gonathon would be wiped away.

Throughout their encounters, Shiori had time and time again admonished Gonathon for being overly reliant on others, for never making choices for herself, and always needing the approval of others to do anything. But here, with only the witch by her side, Gonathon made a [firm and resolute decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15125s) born of her feelings and beliefs: that it was not right for her to remember the Pearl if it meant forcing Shiori to give up her memories, and that above all else that she would not want her memories to be returned if others had to pay a price. She went on to apologize to Shiori for not being able to love the witch the way she wanted, and this caused Shiori to take a pause. Having heard Gonathon’s decision, the witch explained that she had [left a gift in her stall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=15402s) before departing.

While Tam attempted to convince Gonathon of Shiori’s duplicity and manipulation of others, the humble knight would not be swayed, and the exhausted queen and kindhearted retainer departed together. Now left alone, Shiori confessed that she had long made up her mind to relinquish her memories of Gonathon, and imparted the humble knight with one last message thanking her and requesting that she be true to herself.
