#### Main Story

No dungeons were opened on this day. However, the Princess entrusted the heroes with a special quest—one that required them to work together to unlock a cryptic book titled _“The Truth of Ruin.”_

The book’s contents revealed the origins of the corruption, centering around a being known as **the Curse**, a member of the Collective. It hinted that this Curse would ultimately be the final challenge the heroes must overcome in order to truly save the world.

Yet the Curse’s intentions, as well as the true nature and purpose of the Collective, remained shrouded in mystery.
