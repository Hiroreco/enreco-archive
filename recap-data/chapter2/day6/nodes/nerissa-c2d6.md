<!-- title: Nerissa Juliet Ravencroft -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Despite her declaration from yesterday, nothing strange has happened yet… Certainly. Aside from her [portrait](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=344) being moved to a basement, which seemingly served as a secret room for worship. Behind the immaculate portrait were mysterious books stored. Are these books of witchcraft? Simple tales of love and loss? Or an ominous prophecy that has yet to unfold...

**The Quest for Truth**

After completing her daily quests, Nerissa looked into her inventory and found a [special letter](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=996) from the Princess—a special quest? She pondered: could she show it to others now, or would it perhaps be better to wait for the right time? Setting that bit of mystery aside, she decided to pursue a different form of mystery by exploring more of the castle. The books she amassed in the previous days were quite intriguing... Journals of The Rider? The Explorer? The Researcher? Books of Prophecy??? There was certainly more to this world outside of collecting Fia’s memories and contributing to the Kingdom's economy. She had yet to connect all the dots, for a few more pieces to the puzzle sat waiting to be discovered.

In her search for clues, she found more fascinating stories as she talked with the [villagers](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=1859). She learned of their hopes and dreams, their sorrows, and their regrets as they stood waiting for their impending doom.

In light of this, she also found children playing [hide-and-seek](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=1941)... as if there was nothing to worry about, they ran and hide, as free as birds flying in the sky.

**The Princess’ Chambers**

As she continued with her search, Nerissa stumbled upon [the Princess’ chambers](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=2162). There was a guard on duty in front of the door, and while he would say clear as day that nobody could enter the room on his watch, he didn’t make any effort to stop the Maiden from barging in.

She looked and looked and to her surprise, she found letters in the drawers. From whom could they be? Growing curious, she invited herself to skim their contents... Love letters? From Cecilia Immerkind?!

**Six Feet Under**

The signs might not have been obvious earlier, but there had certainly been a change in the demeanor of the once-sweet Maiden. Throughout today, instead of focusing on her food business or just providing food in general out of the kindness of her heart, she toiled underground, creating space to store a [strange device](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=4262)—an instrument that produced enchanting, hypnotic music.

It was quite the effort, as she needed to consult several spirits/voices and grimoires to craft the device itself. Once done, it proved useful as she witnessed Lady Bloodflame fall prey to her collection of haunting [sounds](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=12262) (see: [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper-Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

**Stranger than Fiction**

Was a witch actually born? Lady Bloodflame, Gonathon, and Roa Pandora accidentally found the first level of her secret shrine, as well as the books that were stored behind it. When [confronted](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=12240), she claimed she didn’t know why the painting was moved there nor did she remember how the books were carefully shelved directly behind it.

Did she really not remember? Or was she just deceiving them... for reasons not yet known to anyone?
