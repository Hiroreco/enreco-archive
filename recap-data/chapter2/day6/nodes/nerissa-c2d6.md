<!-- title: Nerissa Juliet Ravencroft -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Despite her declaration from the day before, nothing out of the ordinary had happened... at least, not yet. Well—aside from her [portrait](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=344) being quietly relocated to a basement. A space that, upon closer inspection, revealed itself to be a secret chamber—one seemingly dedicated to worship. Behind the pristine portrait lay shelves of peculiar books. Were they ancient tomes of witchcraft? Simple tales of longing and loss? Or perhaps ominous prophecies that had yet to come true...

**The Quest for Truth**

After completing her daily duties, Nerissa found something new waiting for her in her inventory: a [special letter](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=996) from the Princess. A personal request? A secret quest? She paused—should she share it with the others now, or wait until the time was right?

For now, she shelved that mystery in favor of another. The castle still held many secrets. The books she'd been collecting over the past few days had piqued her interest—journals from The Rider, The Explorer, The Researcher... and maybe even books of prophecy?

Clearly, her role in this world extended beyond gathering Fia’s memories or boosting the Kingdom’s economy. There were dots still unconnected, and somewhere within Libestal lay the remaining pieces to her puzzle.

Her search led her to new stories and whispered secrets, gleaned from talking with the [villagers](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=1859). She listened to their dreams, their fears, their regrets... all while they waited under the looming shadow of an uncertain fate.

And yet, amidst this gloom, children could still be found playing [hide-and-seek](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=1941), laughing and running about like nothing was wrong—as carefree as birds in the sky.

**The Princess’ Chambers**

While exploring deeper into the castle, Nerissa eventually came across [the Princess’ chambers](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=2162). A guard stood watch at the door, insisting that no one was allowed to enter. Yet oddly, he made no move to stop her as she stepped inside.

She began to search. Drawer after drawer, she rummaged—and there they were: letters. But from whom? Intrigued, she read through them. Could they be love letters?

Love letters... from Cecilia Immerkind?

**Six Feet Under**

There had been a shift. Subtle, but unmistakable. The sweet, generous maiden who once cared so deeply about feeding others seemed to fade today. In her place stood someone far more focused and far more secretive.

Rather than running her usual food stall, she toiled beneath the earth, hollowing out space to store a [peculiar device](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=4262)—an instrument that played hypnotic, haunting music.

Its creation hadn’t been easy. She had to consult several spirits, voices, and grimoires just to assemble the thing. But once complete, it proved itself useful. Lady Bloodflame had been caught in its spell, lulled by its eerie [sounds](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=12262) (see: [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper-Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

**Stranger than Fiction**

Had a witch truly been born?

Lady Bloodflame, Gonathon, and Roa Pandora happened upon the first level of Nerissa’s secret shrine—and with it, the books hidden behind her portrait. When [confronted](https://youtu.be/-BFf3e6YJwY?t=12240), she simply claimed ignorance. She didn’t know why her painting had been moved, nor did she remember placing the books so neatly behind it.

Was that the truth? Or was it another veil of deception, spun for reasons known only to her?
