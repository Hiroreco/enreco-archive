**Bonds Beyond Time**

Starting her day once again at Gacharms, Gonathon conversed with her friends and assisted Fuwawa in upgrading her gear. Learning that several of her companions needed to do the previous day’s dungeon, the humble knight wasted no time in volunteering to assist. After a [quick rerun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=1113s) of the dungeon and some farming with Shiori and NinoIna (the latter of whom she engaged in potato touching with), Gonathon found herself at the Mysterious House with many others, all awaiting the announcement of a special event.

While waiting for Nerissa to announce the event, Gonathon made small talk with her many companions, and in particular expressed befuddlement at the concept of a party. Upon Nerissa’s arrival, the knight and the others learned they would be partaking in a strange ritual involving a cursed tome. Although imposing, the [combined expertise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=3914s) of Gonathon, Liz, Nerissa, and Mococo made short work of the ritual. Following rejoicing and a scalp massage for Mococo, Gonathon departed from the group, particularly after witnessing Liz wanting to spend time with Nerissa. 

Following more perplexing conversations with NinoIna, Gonathon was queried by Shiori about putting together an End of the World party. This topic would be put on hold, for a befuddled Liz (see: [Elizabeth-Gonathon: The Knights’ Heartache](#edge:liz-gigi)) called on Gonathon for assistance. Liz explained that she had been hearing odd music at her forge, and the ever-inquisitive Gonathon quickly discovered a hidden trap door leading to an [odd room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=6694s) decorated with Nerissa’s mural and filled with poems. Leaving Liz to muse on these findings, Gonathon was called upon by yet another companion: the lovesick Immerkind.

Immerkind (see [Cecilia-Gonathon: The Knight at Home with the Wolves](#edge:cecilia-gigi)), holding back tears, explained to Gonathon that she had made [the decision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=7987s) to stay in Libestal with her love, the Princess. Gonathon, stricken with grief, stated she did not want to lose Immerkind, but at the same time concluded that, above all else, she wanted Immerkind to be happy. As Immerkind further explained her feelings, Gonathon came to a stark realization: that the words of the princess that Immerkind believed to be only for her were in fact ones she uttered to all the adventurers. Reluctant to accept the truth, but unable to deny it upon confirming with Bijou, Immerkind once more sought to take her own life, but was stopped yet again by Gonathon. She and Bijou begged Immerkind to reconsider, and after managing to talk their friend down, the three shared [a heartfelt talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9264s) about love and the wolf pack.

This sense of calm would not last long, as the humble knight once again found herself dealing with a familiar figure: Shiori of the Nyavellas. Talking with Liz, the scarlet knight divulged a [contentious conspiracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9461s): that she believed that Shiori was in fact selling false memories to others. Immerkind chimed in, [denouncing Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=9785s) as well, stating that Gonathon had been framed for her fall two days prior, and that the two-toned witch was manipulating the kindhearted knight. Following a sojourn into Star Site: Chaos to assist Tam Gandr in receiving the music disk, Gonathon divulged Liz’s thoughts to the queen and Immerkind. Sandwiched (see [Gonathon-Kronii: Passed Pawn](#edge:kronii-gigi)) between her two closest friends, Gonathon admitted she was unsure if Liz’s words were true, as Liz herself seemed to have skeletons in her closet (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper-Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)). With most of their business done for the day, the three returned to the Library and wrote their journals, and this was seemingly the end of things.

Instead, Shiori’s tendrils would pull them back in. First, a seemingly innocent conversation between Shiori and Immerkind on the nature of Fia sparked an [intense, baffling discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=13617s) between Tam, Gonathon, and Immerkind on the nature of the self and love. Next, Shiori and Bijou pulled the trio into the party site, and seemingly, a new controversy surrounding the potential pregnancies of the witch and gem began to take shape. In a stark twist, this was not why Shiori had called Gonathon there, instead, she had a proposition for the humble knight, one that would shake her to her core (see [Gonathon-Shiori: A Memory for a Memory, a Pearl for a Pearl](#edge:gigi-shiori)).

Shiori proposed a [simple trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5xrAxTh8ho&t=14956s): she would provide a complete, clear memory of Gonathon’s Pearl so that Gonathon might remember that which she wished more than anything to remember. However, the cost would be steep: Shiori would lose her memories of Gonathon. This time, though, Gonathon would make a choice not for anyone else, but for herself: she did not think it right to rob Shiori of her memories simply for the chance to remember the Pearl. Seemingly satisfied, Shiori reminisced with Gonathon for a while, with the knight expressing deep regret for being able to love the witch properly.

Although Tam once more sought to open Gonathon’s eyes to Shiori’s duplicities, Gonathon remained faithful to all her friends. Rather, she felt that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders, and together with the queen, the two mulled over what the next day would bring them as the curtains closed on another day.
