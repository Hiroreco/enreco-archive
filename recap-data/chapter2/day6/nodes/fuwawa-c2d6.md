Waking up that morning, Fuwawa braced herself for the usual—an empty café, no customers, no sales, just her, and the quiet hum of her own hope slowly dimming. Maybe, just maybe, her dream would never come true.

But then, Shiori called.

She wanted a catering commission—for a picnic party, no less. Fuwawa, of course, would’ve loved to say yes right away, but doubt crept in. Was she even good enough? Could she really handle it? That was when Shiori hit her with the most unexpected news.

Everything in her store had sold out.

Fuwawa was stunned. Absolutely stunlocked. Surely it was some sort of mistake? But as she scrambled to check the receipts, it was real. Real purchases, real customers—from all kinds of faces, friends and strangers alike. That disbelief melted into joy, a joy so overwhelming it felt like getting hit with a sugar rush. Her efforts, her patience, her heart—it had all paid off.

With her heart soaring, she happily [accepted](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=vtoeq8O8RAHIIn9a&t=887) Shiori’s commission and immediately set out gathering the best ingredients she could find. This would be the biggest moment in her café’s history.

The day kept its joyful tone. She joined her friends for [dungeon runs](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=6WRoJPkQV_34PHWe&t=3259), played a wild [mystery game](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=yz34Cw6rxpyzXVRi&t=6291) where everyone got hilariously heated, and despite being [knocked around](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=lhXHVG9PyhL9_hd_&t=5287) by the Outlander at first, she stood back up with encouragement from her friends and overcame the challenge.

Her café? More alive than ever. [Nerissa](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=2g7ner4_pbuOL_J3&t=1272) came by. [Roa](https://www.youtube.com/live/Yv3kKfGJUfI?si=NIle8EZXYAiU15j8&t=9888) too. People stopped in, tasted her food, and their reactions? Pure awe. They smiled—but none as brightly as Fuwawa. She had done it. She had made others happy with her cooking. Her dream had become real.

Now, a new goal stood before her: make the upcoming picnic party the best it could possibly be. Saying she wasn’t nervous would be a lie—it was a huge job, and the thought of the store going empty again did haunt her. But those fears could wait. What mattered now was holding onto this moment, this happiness, and doing everything she could to make sure it lasted forever.
