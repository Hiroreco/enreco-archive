*The Great Tam Gander... Rotary blades spinning...*

Another day, another set of commissions Shiori was hired to write. Stories must be accurate, and a detail soon escaped Shiori that she had to briefly stop writing to check. On her way, she witnessed a tender moment between Elizabeth and Mococo in front of the Jade Forge. A small moment where Shiori complimented Elizabeth's business before quickly giving the [poor Knight gold](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=677), which Elizabeth refused, though she rejected her refusal. But a kind Knight Elizabeth is, and soon [Shiori received a gift of her own](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1734).

Shiori soon crossed paths with Fuwawa and told her that a special event would take place soon - the Hot Pink One's pregnancy announcement party - and asked if [Fuwawa's Cafe could cater the event](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=801) (which the goddess will be paying for since is *her* party) and if they could set up the venue near her cafe. 

A commission was finally done after Shiori added that last mossy cobblestone, and all that was left was to deliver the story. But, there were more commissions to finish stories... [and memories](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1098). Shiori wrote and wrote, putting down the memories only she, as The Archiver, could know. Details that her customers appreciated, as their true memories were also woven into some of the stories requested. Memories are a precious thing, and like precious things, they come at a price. Soon, the memory was finished and delivered to the Raven One. Now, another... [But at a more appropriate place](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1667). 

[A gift soon made its way to her](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1734) from a certain Red Knight to thank Shiori for her kindness. The two talked, and Shiori was pleased to see the stories she wrote for Elizabeth were displayed. In the midst of their chat, Elizabeth cancelled her memory commission of Ravencroft, to which Shiori easily agreed. The two would share a warm conversation before they parted ways. [It seems Shiori's plan is working today](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=2541).

Shiori later met Ina and Roa in the Quest Hall and immediately invited them to the party, letting them know it was for a gender reveal but [conveniently leaving out whose](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=4265). With Ina and Gonathan, they left for the Remnant field to gather some of the Enigmatic Stones, despite their awkward relationship gone wrong, the Good Knight still protected her from the Stains.

Soon, it was time for her to meet the other heroes in order to purify a cursed tome. With Queen Tam, Cecilia, and Fuwawa, they began their efforts. Cursed books are tricky; something lingered within their parchments that refused to leave. But slowly and surely, the curse was slowly lifted, revealing The Truth Of Ruin. With some time to spare, Shiori invited Queen Tam to the party with the Queen's... mixed feelings. A Constipation Party.

After receiving the construction boxes from Bijou's room, Shiori would set out to [start preparing the venue](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=7878) for tomorrow, inviting more along the way and letting them know it is now a party for Constipation. Gonathan, Queen Tam, and Bijou would also later join her efforts to spruce the place up.

Gonathan... would purchase 19 construction boxes to Shiori's frustration. As before, Gonathan would still spend his money on others, even when they do not need for his generosity. Shiori would [give him 2000 gold](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=8274) and firmly told him that it was his.

Elizabeth would criticize Shiori's story, saying that the details Shiori included within Nerissa's commission are filled with lies. Memories, especially when others were hurt, are hard to accept, and within Shiori's stories are hints of the truth of what happened before. Before Libestal.

Though the moment ended in tension, Shiori nonetheless affirmed that Elizabeth was still invited to the party.

Her attention went back to the party until Roa showed Bijou the ring she bought for Elizabeth. Knowing how Elizabeth's relationship with Nerissa was tense at the moment, Shiori would quickly suggest to Roa that this is her opportunity. Shiori watched Roa attempt to confess, but ultimately, it was today wasn't Roa's day.

It was an admittedly slow day, Shiori wrote in her diary. Even after getting Queen Tam's prize, her fifth attempt at luck was a rather easy endeavour. Even teasing Cecilia about her love for Iphania - suggesting that perhaps Fia was another version of Iphania, and Cecilia could visit her more.


However. The day ended much differently than Shiori thought.

Gonathan.

There was a matter she had to talk to Gonathan about. It was rather frustrating to see that he could not stand for himself. To see Tam speak for him rather stating his own wants. Not waiting for him to speak, Shiori left. Though he soon followed after, [for a moment there was a pregnancy scare for Shiori](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16782) but the moment passed.

[Then... Bijou came to a realization](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16811)

It seemed that the party Shiori was setting up would also be for herself and Bijou. Whether it be a gender reveal or a joint-constipation party with Bijou's other, it is a matter that Shiori would find out tomorrow. But, there are other matters to attend to:
 

[Pearl](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16935)



Shiori witnessed the past romance between the two. She remembered how much [Gonathan had agonized when Pearl lost her memories of her dear husband](https://youtu.be/i7g-HJMqZ_E?t=6028). The relief when they reunited. Shiori offered Gonathan a snippet of his memory with his pearl. Though at the cost of *Shiori's* memory of him. A precious memory was a costly one, one that Shiori would bear for the too-good-hearted knight. 

She was punished before, and she wouldn't mind being punished again for doing this one thing. But the knight rejected her offer, for having [someone else punished](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17098) for the sake of his memory... Even when others told Gonathan of how much he loved Pearl, it wasn't worth having someone else pay the price for him.


[***Shiori of Nyavella... I wish I loved you the way that I wanted to.***](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17340) 

Their relationship was not perfect. Rather, Shiori thought it was filled with much unkindness from her. But it would be a lie to say just unkindness; many moments were filled with sweetness since Gonathan, for all his naive foolishness, was a knight too good for most. For Shiori. With that in mind, Shiori made him promise to buy a book from her stall the next day.

Shiori inquired about Bijou's feelings on her possible pregnancy and told her of Shiori's decision to forget Gonathan. As she waited for her wife to finish writing her diary, Shiori left to place a letter and roses for Gonathan to [find underneath his tree](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17908). Then started [writing the book she made him promise to buy](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=18081). In a cruel twist of fate, [Gonathan would walk by] ignorant that this would be the final meeting between him and the Shiori who loved him.

Before Shiori left to sleep, Queen Tam approached to apologise for interrupting her and Gonathan's talk earlier.
