<!-- title: Koseki Bijou -->
<!-- status: In-bread -->

Bijou tried taking this day a bit easier. Instead of worrying about herself, she tried focusing more on helping others.

She still wanted a little [“pup talk”](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=420) after the madness of the last couple of days, especially yesterday. So she rang up Mococo—she only took appointments by phone.

It went far better than the service she got from the pink chef the other day. Then again, the bar to surpass that was already so low it was practically level to the floor. She left a glowing review and left the call energized for the day.

She’ll probably be fine. Just don’t think.

Back at Gacharms, Fuwawa seemed to be in the market for charms. Roa started handling it while she was away. Gonathon was even nice enough to give Fuwawa an extra ticket! Bijou enjoyed the business while it lasted; as the end of the world draws near, they may not get many sales in the coming days.

Roa soon tells Bijou she landed a date with the Scarlet Knight, Lady Bloodflame! She asked for her Diamond Pickaxe as they were going material hunting. Bijou felt the urge to eavesdrop again, wondering how her boss did. (See [Raora-Elizabeth: Roa's Not-Beach Day Episode!](#edge:raora-liz))

She wasn’t too sneaky about this. While pretending to [“do her dailies”](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2122) and “love maps,” she fumbled constantly as she tried to get within earshot. She even [got caught](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2889) a few times while wandering too close to Lady Bloodflame.

Roa and Elizabeth then got [stuck](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2958) on the edge of a cliff near an invisible border. It got worse as soon as Bijou heard the name “Nerissa”...

She fell into the same exact situation of her boss and the Scarlet Knight. Luckily, she remembered her magic scroll and warped away. She didn’t even think of cleaning up after herself…

Later on, Immerkind summons Bijou to the Great Hall. She wants her to act as moral support as she tries to propose to Princess Iphania. Bijou remained supportive of her knight, enabling her pursuit and feeling kind enough to lend her charms for the Outlander fight.

While waiting to hear back from her knight, she kept herself company with the voices in her head… and started being a bit of a nuisance.

[“Why is your chest bigger than mine?"](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=6576)

When Immerkind returned, Bijou let her off on her own devices… but she called back. There was clearly a misunderstanding, and Bijou was the one to clear it up. Indeed, _everyone_ had the same dialogue with the Princess following the Outlander duel. It was a canon event.

Immerkind started to spiral, now with their self-esteem down the drain. Suddenly, Bijou found herself beside Gonathon, acting as moral support while trying to talk sense into the Kind Knight.

With that over with, Bijou checked out how the picnic area Shiori was making for tomorrow’s party of sorts for IRyS. She also picked up the cakes she ordered from Fuwawa, who was to provide catering. Tam provided the big “IT’S GAS” sign floating above.

It’s probably female gas, Bijou thought. She added pink wool to the back of the letters. Later, she would also have an idea of making floating lanterns around the picnic area, both in pink and light blue.

The picnic-in-preparation would soon be interrupted by Roa. She wanted to talk to the Scarlet Knight again; she bought the fanciest ring she could buy. She was going to try making a move.

Not just Bijou this time, but Shiori as well wanted to eavesdrop and see how it goes down. Neither of them was normal about this. They both went to the special shop to chug an invisibility potion.

Technology had not advanced well enough that their cloaks and effects would go invisible when the potion was consumed; only their bodies did. Roa tried covering up for as long as she could until… Bijou’s potion ran out.

Roa scolded Bijou for not being discreet about her snooping on her date. Though she didn’t realize that Bijou had been eavesdropping since her date earlier in the mountains. Because of her hard work in the shop, Bijou was forgiven.

Now with Gonathon, Immerkind, the Queen, and Shiori, the five of them were gathered for one last round at Star Site: Chaos; Immerkind had yet to win Bae’s music disc. Luckily, they made quick work of the dungeon, and she got it with a 94% drop rate.

Later, Bijou and Shiori had more or less finished decorating the “IT’S GAS” picnic area. She mostly appeared to be spaced out while Shiori took a call with Immerkind, but she did have some things to say anyway.

She decided to [start writing her journal entry](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=14570). She stopped halfway as Tam and Gonathon [approached](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=15364) the table. Of course, this conversation had to end up being cursed beyond belief.

It also revealed a _very shocking revelation:_

[“AM I PREGAGANANT?!?!”](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=15785)

So much for innocence—**Bijou might be pregnant too.** And she literally forgot about the trade she did with Shiori _the other day_.

After her heart-to-hearts with Shiori and her stepmom, the Queen, she finally went back to her journal, practically [screaming into it](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=16625) about this realization. She blames the cursed ritual for this; she got cursed twice after all.

She did one last bit of ~~eavesdropping~~ [map appreciation](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=17101) before turning in for the day.

Bijou hopes the picnic preparations won’t go to waste, and she figures it may be best to have the party before they go to the Heart of Ruin tomorrow. Who knows what will happen after they’re done at the final dungeon?

Whatever tomorrow will bring… It’s probably filled with surprises. And maybe gas.
