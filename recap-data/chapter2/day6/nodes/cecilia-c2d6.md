Cecilia Immerkind returned from her journey afar and has prepared a poem and musical tune for her princess.

However, the state of Libestal was in chaos with the discovery of Star Site: Chaos. Cecilia, Fuwawa, Mococo, and Gonathon depart to the star site where they engage in a variety of trials and slay Stain King: Chaos. [Cecilia chuckles at the thematic differences of the memories between Irys, Kronii, and Bae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I75IWfMGVgM&t=3320s).

The group gathers together for a party at the Assembly hall where they learn they must participate in a challenge in order to [lift a curse upon a certain book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I75IWfMGVgM&t=4270s).

Upon clearing the curse, Princess Bijou accompanies Cecilia as she goes to talk to the princess. She also gracefully lends her power to Cecilia to defeat the Outlander.

Upon defeat of the Outlander, Cecilia gets on her knees and serenades the princess and confesses her love. Cecilia takes the princess word as an agreement; however, Gonathon and Princess Bijou tell her the truth and that leaves her torn (see [Cecilia-Princess](#edge:cecilia-iphania)).

Cecilia now faces a critical choice, to stay with the princess or to return to their reality? Cecilia is willing [to stay behind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I75IWfMGVgM&t=9428s) even if the Princess does not love her back, but she is also torn about leaving the wolf pack, chibi-hime, and her other friends behind. Is it really love if her love is dependent upon the love of the other? (see [Cecilia-Gonathon](#edge:cecilia-gigi))

Cecilia thanks her friends for their counsel as she must make a critical decision in 2 days. This moment of self-reflect was interrupted as the group is roped into the potential confession of Roa to the Red Knight.

For the remainder of the day, Cecilia travels with her companions and listens to the happenings of the town. The drama between Gonathon and Shiori. The love child between several parties. The concerns of the townsfolk of the impending end.

After another exhausting day, Cecilia retires and prepares [another letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I75IWfMGVgM&t=15665s) for the princess. She patiently awaits an answer but will continue her duties for the princess, Libestal, and her friends no matter what the princess says back.
