Bijou tried taking this day a bit easier. Instead of worrying about herself, she tried focusing more on helping others.

She still wanted a little [“pup talk”](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=420) after the madness of the last couple days, especially yesterday. So she rang up [Mococo](#node:mococo-abyssguard)—she only took appointments by phone.

It went far better than the service she got from the pink chef the other day. Then again, the bar to surpass that was already so low it’s practically level to the floor. She left a glowing review and left the call energized for the day. 

She’ll probably be fine. [Just don’t think.](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=750)

----

Back at Gacharms, Fuwawa seems to be in the market for charms. Roa started handling it while she was away. Gonathan was even nice enough to give Fuwawa an extra ticket!

Bijou enjoyed the business while it lasted; as the end of the world draws near, they may not get many sales in the coming days.

Roa soon tells Bijou she landed a date with the Red Knight, Lady Bloodflame! She asked for her Diamond Pickaxe as they were going material hunting. Bijou felt the urge to eavesdrop again, wondering how her boss does. (See [Raora-Elizabeth: Roa's Not-Beach Day Episode!](#edge:roa-pandora-elizabeth-rose-bloodflame-right-1-left-1))

She wasn’t too sneaky about this. While pretending to [“do her dailies”](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2122) and “love maps”, she fumbled constantly as she tried to get within earshot. She even [got caught](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2889) a few times while wandering too close to Lady Bloodflame.

Roa and Elizabeth then got [stuck](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=2958) on the edge of a cliff near an invisible border. It got worse as soon as Bijou heard the name “Nerissa”...

[LEEEEROY JENKIIIIINS](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=3005)

She fell into the exact situation as her boss and the Red Knight. Luckily, she remembered her magic scroll and warped away. She didn’t even think of cleaning up after herself…

She wanted to get hold of Nerissa during that moment, only after hearing her name merely uttered without context. She wanted some food, but suddenly ~~her game crashed~~ fell asleep. Coming to, she just went back to the building area.

Approaching Nerissa’s shack, she suddenly felt suspicious. As if Nerissa were right below her underground. Her voice was audible from above ground; it sounded like she was [in a call](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=3365) with someone. Bijou bought some of her chicken cutlets as if she heard nothing.

----

Her pursuits in eavesdropping would pause for a moment; she received two messages.

First, [Shiori notified her](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=3475) by letter that she had sent over her second story commission. It was filled with little references that made her laugh.

It ended on another cliffhanger, though. Bijou asked Shiori to write more, though she was already flooded with commissions. She also noticed Nerissa donning a [red, pointy hat](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=3749)…?

It’s probably nothing. Anyway, Nerissa read the second message. It was from Princess Iphania about the [Ritual of the Cursed Tome](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=4764), happening today. Bijou led a group with Roa, Bae, and Ina, and they were successful after four attempts.

A cryptic book in the library—[”The Truth of Ruin”](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=6143)—revealed itself once they were done. Its message left the warriors wondering about what it means. A being beyond this plane? The Curse? And who were the Collective? So mysterious…

Immerkind summons Bijou to the Great Hall. She wants her to act as moral support as she tries to propose to Princess Iphania. Bijou remained supportive of her knight, enabling her pursuit and feeling kind enough to lend her charms for the Outlander fight. (See [Immerkind.](#node:cecilia-immerkind))

While waiting to hear back from her knight, she kept herself company with the voices in her head… and started being a bit of a nuisance.

[“Why is your chest bigger than mine?"](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=6576)

When Immerkind returned, Bijou let her off on their own devices… but she called back. There was clearly a misunderstanding, and Bijou was the one to clear it up. Indeed, *everyone* had the same dialogue with the Princess following the Outlander duel. It was a canon event.

Immerkind started to spiral, now with their self-esteem down the drain. Suddenly, Bijou found herself beside Gonathan, acting as moral support while trying to talk sense into the kind knight. (See [Gonathan](#node:gonathon-g).)

----

With that over with, Bijou checked out how the picnic area [Shiori](#node:shiori-nyavella) was making for tomorrow’s party of sorts for IRyS. She also picked up the cakes she ordered from [Fuwawa](#node:fuwawa-abyssguard), who was to provide catering. Tam provided the big “IT’S GAS” sign floating above.

It’s probably female gas, Bijou thought. She added pink wool to the back of the letters. Later, she would also have an idea of making floating lanterns around the picnic area, both in pink and light blue.

The picnic-in-preparation would soon be interrupted by [Roa](#node:roa-pandora). She wanted to talk to the Red Knight again; she bought the fanciest ring she could buy. She was gonna try making a move.

Not just Bijou this time, but Shiori as well wanted to eavesdrop and see how it goes down. Neither of them were normal about this. They both went to the special shop to chug an invisibility potion.

Technology had not advanced well enough that their cloaks and effects would go invisible when the potion was consumed; only their bodies did. Roa tried covering up for as long as she could until… Bijou’s potion ran out.

[Uncloaked](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=10983)

Roa scolded Bijou for not being discreet about her snooping on her date. Though she didn’t realize that Bijou had been eavesdropping since her date earlier in the mountains. Because of her hard work in the shop, Bijou was forgiven.

Now with Gonathan, Immerkind, the Queen, and [Shiori](#node:shiori-nyavella), the five of them gathered for one last round at Star Site: Chaos; Immerkind had yet to win Bae’s music disc. Luckily, they made quick work of the dungeon, and she got it with a 94% drop rate.

----

Later, Bijou and Shiori had more or less finished decorating the “IT’S GAS” picnic area. She mostly appeared to be spaced out while Shiori took a call with Immerkind, but she did have some things to say anyway.

She decided to [start writing her journal](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=14570). She stopped halfway as Tam and Gonathan [approached](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=15364) the table. Of course, this conversation had to end up being cursed beyond belief. (See [Kronii](#node:tam-gandr).)

It also revealed a *very shocking revelation:*

[“AM I PREGAGANANT?!?!”](#embed:https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=15785)

So much for innocence—**Bijou might be pregnant too.** And she literally forgot about the trade she did with Shiori *the other day*.

After her heart-to-hearts with Shiori and her step-mom, the Queen, she finally went back to her journal, practically [screaming into it](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=16625) about this realization. She blames the cursed ritual for this; she got cursed twice after all.

She did one last bit of ~~eavesdropping~~ [map appreciation](https://youtu.be/uMenK-yr3ss?t=17101) before turning in for the day. (See [Shiori](#node:shiori-nyavella))

Bijou hopes the picnic preparations won’t go to waste; she figures it may be best to have the party before they go to the Heart of Ruin tomorrow. Who knows what will happen after they’re done at the final dungeon?

Whatever tomorrow will bring… It’s probably filled with surprises. And maybe gas.
