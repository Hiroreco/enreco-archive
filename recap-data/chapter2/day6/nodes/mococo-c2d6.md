_“It’s my birthday!”_

It was going to be a great day for the doggy jeweler—especially because it was her birthday, of course! So naturally, Mococo had been expecting warm gifts and greetings from her friends.

She first received an upgrade stone from Shakira to pay for therapy costs (for which Mococo later writes a thank you sign). Then, Mococo ventured to the Jade Forge, where she met her sister—[who had just now learned of her birthday](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=677)—and had given her more stones as a gift for her wonderful sister.

Back in _Gacharms_, Mococo decided she would take over the store for a short while.

Later on, Bijou pulls Mococo aside to give her a salary for helping the business. The money-hungry dog grew sporadic once her fellow jeweler finally bestowed her _2250 coin_ profit share from their business. That's [BIG MONEY!](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=1392s)

She used this golden opportunity to advertise to Bijou her (un)professional mental health services for the low, low cost of 100 coins! Such affordable pricing convinces Bijou enough to try her phone therapy out.

Now to other matters—such as completing the Star Site: Chaos Dungeon! With the help of Gonathon, Immerkind, and Bijou, Mococo knew that anything was possible... [even though she lost the disc gacha.](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=4441s)

She went on to fight the Outlander. During which, she received a call from Nerissa to complete a new, _special_ quest called _the Cursed Tome_.

To play the quest, Nerissa opened a ritual for Mococo, Gonathon, and Elizabeth to join!

And, uh oh! This pup got cursed!

She can't let anyone know about it. Even if they had [succeeded](https://www.youtube.com/live/3ybwXx6rUPg?t=6406s) in the quest, she felt the urge to be curse-free.

_What would the others think?_

Well, her friends reassured her that they would always be there, even if she had indeed been cursed. Even so, this doggy still retreated into a corner to recover for the night...
