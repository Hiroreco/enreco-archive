_The Great Tam Gander... Rotary blades spinning..._

Another day, another set of commissions Shiori was hired to write. Stories with details down to a tee. And unlike Shiori's stories, today seemed limitless in its subplots, such as witnessing the Scarlet Knight's and the Fuzzy One's tender moment of sister-like companionship, [Elizabeth's kindness towards Shiori](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1734) (in return for [Shiori's generosity](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=677)), and recruiting Fuwawa's services for a special event—the Hot Pink One's pregnancy announcement. Of course, the goddess will be shouldering the costs; it is _her_ party.

Soon, the queenly commission was done; a touch of mossy cobblestone on the parchment was all that was left, and all that was left was to deliver the story.

But there were more commissions to finish stories and—[memories](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1098). Shiori wrote and wrote, putting down the memories only she, as the Archiver, could know. Details that her customers appreciated, as their true memories were also woven into some of the stories requested. Memories are precious things, and like precious things, they come at a price. Soon, the memory was finished and delivered to the Raven One. Now, another... [but at a more appropriate place](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1667).

[Another gift soon made its way to her](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=1734) from Elizabeth to thank Shiori for her kindness. The two talked, and Shiori was pleased to see the stories she wrote for Elizabeth were displayed, although Elizabeth decided to cancel her memory commission of Ravencroft, to which Shiori easily agreed. The two would share a warm conversation before they parted ways. [It seems Shiori's plan is working today](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=2541).

Shiori later met Ina and Roa in the Quest Hall and immediately invited them to the HPO's party, letting them know it was for a gender reveal, though she [conveniently left out whose](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=4265). With Ina and Gonathon, they left for the Remnant fields to gather some of the Enigmatic Stones; despite their awkward relationship gone wrong, the Good Knight still protected her from the Stains.

Soon, it was time for her to meet the other heroes to purify a cursed tome. With Queen Tam, Cecilia, and Fuwawa, they began their efforts. Cursed books are tricky; something lingered within their parchments that refused to leave. But slowly and surely, the curse was slowly lifted, revealing The Truth Of Ruin. With some time to spare, Shiori invited Queen Tam to the party with the Queen's mixed feelings. A Constipation Party.

After receiving the construction boxes from Bijou, Shiori would set out to [start preparing the venue](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=7878) for tomorrow, inviting more along the way and letting them know it is now a party for Constipation. Others would also later join her efforts to spruce the place up, including Gonathon who, to Shiori's frustration, would unnecessarily donate 19 construction boxes to help with the party preparations, sharing his unneeded and unasked generosity once again. Shiori would compensate him for [his good deed](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=8274).

But, soon after, Shiori was confronted by a certain Scarlet Knight.

It seemed not everyone enjoyed the stories Shiori wrote (see [Elizabeth-Shiori](#edge:liz-shiori)).

Her attention went back to the party until Roa showed Bijou the ring she bought for Elizabeth. Knowing how Elizabeth's relationship with Nerissa was tense at the moment, Shiori quickly suggested to Roa that this was her opportunity. Shiori spied on Roa's attempt to confess, but ultimately, today wasn't Roa's day.

It was an admittedly slow day, Shiori wrote in her diary. Even after getting Queen Tam's prize, her fifth attempt at luck was a rather easy endeavor. Even teasing Cecilia about her love for Iphania—suggesting that perhaps Fia was another version of Iphania, and Cecilia could visit her more.

However. The day would end differently than Shiori thought.

There was an important matter she had to talk to Gonathon about but her efforts were impeded by Queen Tam. It was frustrating to see Gonathon stay silent while Tam spoke for him, unwilling to speak his own thoughts. Seeing that, Shiori, along with Bijou, left, but he soon followed after them. For a moment there was a [pregnancy scare](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16782), but the moment passed.

[Then... Bijou came to a gassy realization](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16811)

Bijou _had_ been feeling strange today... It seems the brothers may share the party tomorrow.

Finally, everyone else left, leaving Gonathon and Shiori alone.

[Pearl](#embed:https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=16935)

Shiori witnessed the past romance between the two. She remembered how much [Gonathon had agonized when Pearl lost her memories of her dear husband](https://youtu.be/i7g-HJMqZ_E?t=6028). The relief when they reunited. Shiori offered Gonathon a snippet of his memory with his pearl. Though at the cost of _Shiori's_ memory of him. A precious memory was a costly one, one that Shiori would bear for the too-good-hearted knight. An offer that Gonathon refused. To have [someone else punished](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17098) for his boon was something Gonathon could not agree to.

Their relationship was not perfect. Rather, Shiori thought it was filled with much unkindness from her. But it would be a lie to say just unkindness; many moments were filled with sweetness since Gonathon, for all his naive foolishness, was a knight too good for most. For Shiori. With that in mind, Shiori made him promise to buy a book from her stall the next day (see [Gigi-Shiori](#edge:gigi-shiori)).

A day that began with peace ended with turmoil. As Shiori waited for her wife to finish writing her diary, Shiori left a letter and roses for [Gonathon to find underneath his tree](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=17908). Afterwards, she wrote the book she made [Gonathon promise to buy](https://youtu.be/tJ_YXGE3o2w?t=18081). A book she wrote while Gonathon passed by, ignorant that this would be the final moment between him and the Nyavella who loved him.

Before Shiori left to sleep, Queen Tam approached to apologize for interrupting her and Gonathon's talk earlier.
