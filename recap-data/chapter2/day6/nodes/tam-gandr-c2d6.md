Perfect Queen Tam Gandr woke up from her perfect slumber in her perfect “truck” abode.

She might have been a bit sleepy, but she was raring to go about her day. She even stopped for a moment to give tips to Fuwawa, who was struggling with her duel against the Outlander.

It seemed like a perfect day.

After being summoned by Nerissa, Queen Tam and all the heroes went to the Assembly Hall. Everyone present that day exchanged pleasantries—and that’s when the cracks in her seemingly perfect day began to show, at the mention of the Hot Pink One and her “gassy” problem from the previous day.

Nerissa read out a letter sent by Princess Iphania regarding an ancient tome that could help the heroes fight the Ruination. However, a certain ritual needed to be performed—one that could even place them under the curse as well.

Even then, Queen Tam had a more troubling matter at hand: Rao Pandora, and what had transpired the previous day. The latter was quick to remind her to remember what happened.

Queen Tam proceeded to form a party with Shiori, Immerkind, and Fuwawa—a surprising combination, to say the least—to tackle the ritual.

The ritual itself was odd and likely confused most of those involved, including Queen Tam. Either that, or she simply couldn’t help but act suspicious (which was ironic, considering that finding the suspicious one was one of the main objectives of the ritual).

Having finished the ritual without learning much of anything, Queen Tam had a quick conversation with Shiori—who wanted to organize a celebration for the HPO’s constipation upon her return. The Queen begrudgingly agreed and then headed to the main hall to gather materials from the shops.

Perhaps due to the stress of the previous day, the Queen began desperately gambling away her coins for a chance to win "figurines." It was there that she encountered Rao Pandora again and engaged in an awkward conversation about their new “relationship dynamic.”

She neither won any prizes nor regained any social standing with the big pink cat.

Truth be told, the Queen simply didn’t know what to do anymore and decided to help Shiori with the cursed celebration for HPO. What greeted Queen Tam was a huge picnic blanket laid out in the field beside Fuwawa’s shop, with an amazing backdrop of Gonathon’s Treehouse. The tree’s owner even dropped by to donate materials for the decorations.

In a surprising turn of [character development](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=3400), the Queen admitted to others—for the first time—that she was poor and actually needed help. It only took two timelines and multiple disasters to bring her to this point.

Shiori and Queen Tam began working on the decorations—the former crafting a pretty wooden arch, and the latter creating a bombastic glowing sign that read “ITS GAS,” referring to the supposed “baby” born from HPO. It was a struggle, to say the least. The Queen refused to listen to the voices in her head telling her that her “S” looked like an invented alphabet.

In the end, everything literally clicked into place, and the Queen stood back to marvel at her handiwork. Of course, how could she err? She’s perfect. “It’s magnificent,” she said. [“This is the most creative I’ve been in my entire life,”](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=4713) she added.

Struck with creative inspiration—and with a generous sprinkling of praise from Shiori—Queen Tam went back to her abode and decided to spruce it up. It did look like a "truck," the voices in her head chimed. She began renovating most of the outer walls and ended up with a decidedly ominous-looking stone house. Queen Tam and the voices in her head were all confused at the outcome, but art is subjective—so who could say she did a bad job?

Indeed, that day was uneventful—at least in comparison with the tumultuous previous days. The voices remarked it was mostly due to the absence of HPO that day.

After a brief exchange of howls with her knights, Gonathon and Immerkind, they all decided to tackle the Star Site: Chaos dungeon in order to retrieve the hidden treasure. Of course, this triggered [painful memories](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=7690) from the previous day for the Queen, who had suffered through the same dungeon over and over due to unsuccessful attempts—on top of the heated arguments with the two women she was secretly juggling. Together with the two knights, as well as Bijou and Shiori, they eventually retrieved the dungeon treasure from the Star Site.

After being sandwiched in a closet between Gonathon and Immerkind, the Queen listened to her Humble Knight's recent woes. Apparently, Lady Bloodflame told him that Shiori was a scammer who sold memories because she actually remembers everything about them. Somehow, gossiping about Nerissa and Lady Bloodflame led to the three howling at the moon. No mentions of [maids](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=9901) were made by Immerkind.

Getting ready to end the day with writing her journal entry, Queen Tam concluded on a happy note, saying she was excited for the next day.

If only the Queen’s day had ended there, it would have actually been perfect. However, she deemed it necessary to engage in a cursed conversation with Immerkind and Gonathon regarding the question: “If your lover turned into a cat, would you still love them?” The conversation devolved further, replacing the cat with a [tapeworm](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=11053)—much to the disgust of the voices in her head.

The day actually ended with a burst of drama under the “ITS GAS” signboard involving Shiori, Gonathon, and Bijou, who innocently asked how babies are born. Queen Tam was so taken aback by the question, the [pause](https://youtu.be/jayBiB9euJU?t=11542) itself was also pregnant.

The situation grew even more bizarre for the Queen and her Humble Knight when Shiori kept asking him to talk in private. Sensing more heartbreak for the gullible knight, Queen Tam did her best to separate him from Shiori and save him—much like how Gonathon had been there for her the previous day. It was then revealed that, somehow, Shiori was pregnant and that Gonathon wanted to take responsibility for the supposed child. Queen Tam managed to convince Gonathon that handholding does not indeed make babies, and that this Shiori was manipulating him like clay in her hands—him and Bijou both. They howled to seal their new understanding.

Curiously, Queen Tam deemed that Shiori did have some redeeming qualities and exchanged pleasantries with her and Bijou—who suddenly vomited, saying it was *nothing*.

With that, the Queen retired for the day and went to her perfect slumber once again.
