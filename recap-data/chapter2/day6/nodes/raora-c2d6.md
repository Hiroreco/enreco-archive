It was a sleepy start for Roa's day as she pondered what to do. Her beloved shop, The Gacharms, was doing well with little for her to do. Perhaps today she should focus on something else... Or Someone else.

With that person in mind, Roa [called her Red Knight](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=748). She needed more upgrade stones, which Elizabeth was more than happy to supply, though she would need materials to craft them. Seeing this opportunity, Roa would offer to go with her to the Remnant fields to help mine for the Enigmatic Stones they would need. Elizabeth agreed and suggested that they meet by the wagon.

As Roa waited, giddy to see Elizabeth once again, she came across Fuwawa and was shocked to hear that Fuwawa had never bought a charm before. As a businesswoman, Roa found it would be a travesty to let a customer get away; she quickly brought Fuwawa to The Gacharms Shop, explaining the mechanics of the gacha system, which ended with [Fuwawa winning splendid prizes](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=978). 

Soon enough, Elizabeth called to meet her by the wagon to start their, in Roa's eyes, date when Bijou suddenly appeared nearby. [Bijou would ask Roa how her pursuit fares](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=1668). Excited, Roa told her she would have a date with Elizabeth soon.

[A Pretty Kitty and Her Shining Star](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=1970)

A glowing moon lit the field while the stars above glowed with delight. An objectively beautiful scene with [a Mysterious Fish](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=2021) drowning in the background. 

Roa's date with Elizabeth went well with the two idly talking as they mined. Roa then subtly inquired about [Elizabeth's Secret Admirer](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=2155). Elizabeth still had no clue about who could be the one leaving her gifts and mentioned wanting to give them one as thanks. Sensing the opportunity, Roa told Elizabeth that perhaps Elizabeth would find out soon enough.

The date was going well. They were spending more time together when, unfortunately, a romcom episode is incomplete without something going wrong: [Roa fell and was stuck at the edge of the world](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=2635), with Elizabeth following soon after. Panicked that they wouldn't be able to get back, Elizabeth would immediately call for help. From Nerissa Ravencroft. Roa's Rival.

[LEEERRRROOOOOYYYYY JEENKIIINNN!](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=2764)

With a clever timing from Bijou, she gave Roa a moment of levity to distract her from her jealousy and regain her composure. But as quickly as she crashed, Bijou left, and the green-eyed monster swiftly  returned. Still miffed that Elizabeth would still refer to Nerissa for help, Roa immediately figured out how to get out of their predicament, and both found their way back to Libestal. Elizabeth would give the legendary upgrade stones, and Roa would promise to repay this kindness by [giving the Knight some of her best charms](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=3227).

Elizabeth would then take Roa to see her new  [LOOO(Liz's Out of Office)](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=3331), a rather comfortable bedroom-office. Roa was admired when a melody started playing. It was almost romantic at first, but then the moment would ultimately be ruined by Nerissa's [gifts were mentioned](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=3463).

Roa would then meet Bijou to ask about their inventory; perhaps there was something suitable there for Elizabeth. But the gifts would have to wait as the job must be done first: to purify the tome. They all met in the assembly hall to begin their quest.


Together with Ina, Bijou, and Bae, Roa had to play a strange game to find who was cursed by the tome. It was confusing, as the cursed one would shift after each round, and their answers would sometimes be too close to tell who would try to foil their attempts. 

The curse would shift from Bae to Roa to Bijou until it was purified bit by bit, leaving a book that may be able to answer some of their questions. But, [concern lingered](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=5760) about the possibility that the curse may have stayed with someone, but it was a concern thankfully unfounded. In the library, they uncover [The Truth of Ruin](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=5936). The source of Ruination and Stains may not be from Libestal but elsewhere...

Business done, Roa met Queen Tam in the Quest Hall and heard that something interesting happened the other day after Roa left. It seemed to be too complicated for the Queen to explain, and Roa could only wonder what transpired. Gonathan would also remind Roa of the Constipation Party (also known as 'The End of World Party').


Roa would heed Bijou's advice and craft Elizabeth's charms herself. Satisfied with what she had, Roa would go to meet her at the Jade Forge. There, the music returned. The music led them underground where, a [portrait of Nerissa was displayed](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=7518). Behind it... were gifts meant for Elizabeth.

The jealousy finally culminated, erupting from [Roa as she demanded that Elizabeth put the gifts back](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=7582), reminding Elizabeth that *Nerissa is a witch*. Roa would run away in tears and spend her time in the Remnant fields. There, she swore to earn the gold, [5000 coins to buy a gift](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=7759) for Elizabeth, and confess her feelings. It was an endless battle. Stain after Stain, Roa unleashed all her frustrations against those who stood in the way of her love. 

But through her pain, and through Bijou's busy phone, Roa planned to bring Elizabeth here, [to the top of the remnant field, and confess her feelings](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=8387). In the midst of her planning, Bijou finally called back. Bijou had some money from the shop to give, and there was something beautiful to see by Fuwawa's Cafe. 

Perhaps it was due to seeing Fuwawa doing her best, perhaps it was the food she served, but Roa felt more relaxed. Sadly, the moment was lost when Bijou inquired about Roa's date. But, rather than anger, Roa was more determined to win Elizabeth's love. 

In another turn of clich√©d events, Elizabeth was suddenly nearby. Worried about how Roa had suddenly left, Elizabeth had informed Roa that she put back the items in Nerissa's spot, and Roa immediately took the opportunity.

[Charms for Her Red Knight](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=8936)

3 legendary charms for a Legendary Knight. Roa apologised as well, for running suddenly, which Elizabeth immediately said she understood. Roa told Elizabeth to remember her when she fights with her charms, that they would watch her in Roa's place. Touched, Elizabeth called Roa her shield... [When the moment was ruined by the music playing.](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=9064) 

So what if Nerissa may have already caught Elizabeth's eye? So what if the Raven had magic and Roa didn't have magic? She's the owner of a successful business; if she can put her mind to gathering a large profit, then she can win Elizabeth's heart. Back in the fields, she fought once again until [the money, then the ring, was hers.](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=9770)

Ring obtained. Charms restocked. Roa was almost done for the day. She passed by the party location and listened to Bijou's plan for her brother and her eternal consort for tomorrow. Excited, she showed Bijou and Shiori the ring when Shiori mentioned Elizabeth was upset, and there seemed to be turmoil between her and Nerissa.

Concerned and selfishly motivated, Roa began looking for Elizabeth until she found her in a call with *someone*. A moment of jealousy before realising it was Gonathan on the phone with Elizabeth, Roa changed the subject.

[A painfully awkward moment was evoked by Bijou, who really loved maps on this RomCom Episode of EnReco](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10487), aside Roa quickly attempted to change the subject, but Elizabeth interrupted first, warning Roa to be careful of Shiori due to the false memories she sells. 

[Her Flame Differently Flickers... For the 3 of Them](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10566)

Roa suggested that maybe it was different for the three of them. Hoping that hers was more special, [then, a Cloak of Wisdom](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10779), whose identity we totally, *completely* did not know (It's Bijou), appeared. Then a second, less suspicious cloak joined. The romantic moment may not have been there in the first place, Roa may have been comrade-zone, but there was no denying that there is a [special bond between Roa and Elizabeth.](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10878)

Seeing Bijou once again, Roa took her aside, told her, and Shiori, how it went,  when [Shiori had a suggestion](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10994):
Tell Elizabeth little stories of Nerissa? That might jog Elizabeth's memory... The topic was immediately dropped when Immerkind and Gonathan passed by. Someone then immediately suggested using the Constipation Party area to propose to Elizabeth. Bijou includes blue and pink floating lanterns to set the mood.

A plan was secured for tomorrow. Roa would soon write in her diary, the excitement flowing through her quill.

[Hello Pandora](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=11534)

Nerissa passed by and they exchanged pleasantries. Whether Nerissa knew that Roa foiled her plans to make Elizabeth her own couldn't be known, but the two remain cordial as they parted ways.
