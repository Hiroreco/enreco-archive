It was a sleepy start for Roa's day as she pondered what to do. Her beloved shop, The Gacharms, was doing well with little for her to do. Perhaps today she should focus on something else... Or Someone else.

With that person in mind, Roa [called her Red Knight](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=748) and, needing more upgrade stones, offered to accompany Elizabeth to the Remnant fields to mine Enigmatic Stones, which Elizabeth agreed to, suggesting they meet by the wagon.

As Roa waited, giddy to see Elizabeth once again, she came across Fuwawa and was shocked to hear that Fuwawa had never bought a charm before. As a businesswoman, Roa found it would be a travesty to let a customer get away; she quickly brought Fuwawa to The Gacharms Shop, explaining the mechanics of the gacha system, which ended with [Fuwawa winning splendid prizes](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=978). 

Soon enough, Elizabeth called to meet her by the wagon to start their, in Roa's eyes, date. (See [Roa-Elizabeth: Roa's Not-Beach Day Episode!](#edge:raora-liz))

Roa would then meet Bijou to ask about their inventory; perhaps there was something suitable there for Elizabeth. But the gifts would have to wait as the job must be done first: to purify the tome. They all met in the assembly hall to begin their quest.

Together with Ina, Bijou, and Bae, Roa had to play a strange game to find who was cursed by the tome. It was confusing, as the cursed one would shift after each round, and their answers would sometimes be too close to tell who would try to foil their attempts. 

The curse would shift from Bae to Roa to Bijou until it was purified bit by bit, leaving a book that may be able to answer some of their questions. But, [concern lingered](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=5760) about the possibility that the curse may have stayed with someone, but it was a concern thankfully unfounded. In the library, they uncover [The Truth of Ruin](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=5936). The source of Ruination and Stains may not be from Libestal but elsewhere...

Business done, Roa met Queen Tam in the Quest Hall and heard that something interesting happened the other day after Roa left. It seemed to be too complicated for the Queen to explain, and Roa could only wonder what transpired. Gonathan would also remind Roa of the Constipation Party (also known as 'The End of World Party').

So what if Nerissa may have already caught Elizabeth's eye? So what if the Raven had magic and Roa didn't have magic? She's the owner of a successful business; if she can put her mind to gathering a large profit, then she can win Elizabeth's heart. Back in the fields, she fought once again until [the money, then the ring, was hers.](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=9770)

Ring obtained. Charms restocked. Roa was almost done for the day. She passed by the party location and listened to Bijou's plan for her brother and her eternal consort for tomorrow. Excited, she showed Bijou and Shiori the ring when Shiori mentioned Elizabeth was upset, and there seemed to be turmoil between her and Nerissa.

Concerned and selfishly motivated, Roa began looking for Elizabeth until she found her in a call with *someone*. A moment of jealousy before realising it was Gonathan on the phone with Elizabeth, Roa changed the subject.

[A painfully awkward moment was evoked by Bijou, who really loved maps on this RomCom Episode of EnReco](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10487), aside Roa quickly attempted to change the subject, but Elizabeth interrupted first, warning Roa to be careful of Shiori due to the false memories she sells. 

[Her Flame Differently Flickers... For the 3 of Them](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10566)

Roa suggested that maybe it was different for the three of them. Hoping that hers was more special, [then, a Cloak of Wisdom](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10779), whose identity we totally, *completely* did not know (It's Bijou), appeared. Then a second, less suspicious cloak joined. The romantic moment may not have been there in the first place, Roa may have been comrade-zone, but there was no denying that there is a [special bond between Roa and Elizabeth.](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10878)

Seeing Bijou once again, Roa took her aside, told her, and Shiori, how it went,  when [Shiori had a suggestion](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=10994):
Tell Elizabeth little stories of Nerissa? That might jog Elizabeth's memory... The topic was immediately dropped when Immerkind and Gonathan passed by. Someone then immediately suggested using the Constipation Party area to propose to Elizabeth. Bijou includes blue and pink floating lanterns to set the mood.

A plan was secured for tomorrow. Roa would soon write in her diary, the excitement flowing through her quill.

[Hello Pandora](https://youtu.be/E-LGNO7JdO4?t=11534)

Nerissa passed by and they exchanged pleasantries. Whether Nerissa knew that Roa foiled her plans to make Elizabeth her own couldn't be known, but the two remain cordial as they parted ways.
