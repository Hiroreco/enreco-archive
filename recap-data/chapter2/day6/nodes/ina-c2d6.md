The Hero rose alongside the morning sun in her lovely brick home. Her recaps are so serene that you cannot believe it.

Remember that talk the day before, when the Hot Pink One was supposed to tell the Hot Purple One everything today? Well, the Hot Pink One took a rest day and was never seen around the kingdom; she escaped the hands of fate for one day.

Regardless, the impact of IRyS' debacles permeates throughout the kingdom regardless of her physical presence; there's a gender reveal party planned for a mystery newly pregnant individual in Libestal—take a good wild guess who it was for. NinoIna received an invitation through word of mouth, knowing not of its nature, certainly not how close she herself was to the epicenter of it.

The Hero's appearances in the kingdom were not numerous—having all of her gear upgraded to its best form, she found less need to roam around the Remnants for materials. Nowadays, most of her busywork would be related to her daily tasks, and none beyond. But she would never shy away from the opportunity of being iconic in her interactions.

Upon arriving on time at today's rendezvous point—which was apparently early, because none of the organizers were on location yet—she and the Humble Knight Gonathon with a G just messed around, [engaged in conversation](https://youtu.be/EkwigIYpcdI?t=895s), and entertained each other. (The sketch they're referencing originally came out 18 years ago. Let that sink in.)

She's mostly doing a lot of people-watching, including the peasant's greeting to Immerkind, all the way until she enters the day's point of interest. NinoIna was no stranger to a sealed ancient tome—she had one of her own, after all. The mystical cursing properties of the tome also did not affect the Hero's vessel nor spirit in the slightest, as expected of a real hero.
