<!-- title: Elizabeth Smith Bloodflame -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

From the start of the day, it seemed that Liz had Juliet living rent-free in the back of her mind. Her usual morning routine of writing in her journal left an entire section dedicated [to Juliet, signed by Romeo](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=7SOCL_EVYdha0nu6&t=270). Elizabeth felt bound by duty, memory, and expectation, leaving her envying Nerissa's freedom or perhaps admiring it.

With more gifts from anonymous donors, Elizabeth realizes it's time to expand the LOO and move its location from indoors to around the backside, making it easier to access the basement from behind the Jade Forge.

After a mighty fight with the ping ghost, Elizabeth returns home to hear [ominous noises](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=xi3bxaGJIB71yY1m&t=11566) from somewhere nearby. As a Jade Sword Knight, she takes it upon herself to investigate where the loud music comes from. Unable to find the source with the music stopped, she put a pin in this concern to handle later.

Without a second thought, she finally purchased the [gorgeous ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=12995s). And soon after, encounters Shiori. After a brief discussion about [self-insects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=13650s), Elizabeth crafts a loving letter meant for... Shiori. After quickly gifting this witch a rose and a CD in return for her kindness, Elizabeth rescinds her request for memories of Nerissa to respect her privacy. And doesn't hand over the letter.

Calling upon Roa for an earlier request to upgrade her weapon, Elizabeth sets out to show her where to obtain the items. After a traumatic fall off the edge of a mountain, Roa and Elizabeth find themselves [stuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=16810s). A quick call to Nerissa has Roa on the defensive, saying there was no need, but Elizabeth does so anyway. After Bloodfumble returns with poor phrasing, Bijou joins them, and the call ends.

Against her wishes, Elizabeth has no choice but to use magic to escape to safety.

Soon after, the event begins with a letter from the Princess herself. Everyone is to perform a ritual to clear a mysterious and cursed tome. Without a second thought, Elizabeth teams up with Nerissa, Gonathon, and Mococo. The group successfully clears it in two tries, and concern arises for her sister Mococo, who was double-cursed during the ritual.

After reading the book in the Library, Elizabeth finally talks to Nerissa, requesting they spar again. After a short talk with Gonathon, she makes it up to the sparring area after walking the entire way again like a true and proper knight.

With a 2-0 fight in Liz's favor, Nerissa has one last chance to win and claim the prize. Without being nicked even once, the Witch wins the battle and passes her the [ring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEB2dIe37oo&t=20317s).

Back at the Jade Forge once again, the ominous music returned. After a quick call agreeing to make some frames for Shiori, Elizabeth quickly calls fellow knight Gonathon for aid in finding the source of this music. Roa also joins the three of them in beginning the search for the source of this music.

The trapdoor in front of Nerissa's shop is discovered. Descending from above, they find the painting of Nerissa on full display down below. A quick deduction finds they can [walk through](https://www.youtube.com/live/uEB2dIe37oo?si=TBhhbOiLoWd3Pp5n&t=21702) and find a chest with a rose inside and four books.

Roa has a fit about the books, not wanting Liz to read them before taking off, upset and leaving Elizabeth and Gonathon to inquire about the readings. Finding the music too loud, the two of them go upstairs to read the stories before them.

Concern rises within Elizabeth as she reads on. Once she encountered the Witch, she quickly asks Nerissa if she's okay. Questions lead to no one knowing how the painting got down below the ground, which leads to Elizabeth requesting that Nerissa stay the night in her LOO for safety.

After a brief break, Nerissa again approaches Elizabeth about reading The Cell by Shiori (see [Elizabeth-Nerissa: Paper Thin](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

Concern rises within the knight, with the worries on her mind, Elizabeth hunts down Shiori, calling her stories scams and lies. However, Shiori asks her an unexpected question (see [Elizabeth-Shiori](#edge:liz-shiori)).

With the question ringing in her mind, Elizabeth returns to her room and scraps the initial letter meant for Shiori, instead writing a letter to Mococo before tucking away for the night.
