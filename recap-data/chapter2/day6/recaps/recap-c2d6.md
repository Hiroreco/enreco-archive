## Day 6: The Silence Before the Surge

A somewhat… *normal* day? No way—really? Are we still in the same adventure? Still in the chaotic lands of Libestal? Still following the 15 agents of drama, scams, and emotional damage?

Apparently so. But hey, even the wildest horses need to catch their breath sometimes. Or at least, that’s what it *seemed* like on the surface.

Day six didn’t begin with a brand-new dungeon, unlike the ones before it. Instead, the heroes were offered something different: a special quest. A *ritual*. Or simply put—a game. A test of wits, trust, and lie detection. Everything they had previously used to stir up trouble, now turned toward a challenge of intellect and teamwork. 

Upon clearing the ritual, the heroes were rewarded with a mysterious book: **“The Truth of Ruin.”** Within it, scattered fragments of knowledge—clues about the evil that rampaged the world—began to take form. The deeper truths of the world they found themselves in… slowly began to reveal themselves.

Now normally, this is the part where the summary descends into chaos. But today? Things remained oddly... tame. Well, tame *by Libestal standards*, which still includes:

* Roa taking Elizabeth on a “date,” only for it to be constantly interrupted by Elizabeth’s ex-daughter.
* Immergood confesses her feelings to the Princess she’s been low-key obsessed with for a while now. Sweet, fluffy, even emotional.

It was all cute. All calm. A bit *too* calm.

This felt like the “calm before the storm.” Tiny ripples of tension hinted at the greater waves to come. A tense conversation between Elizabeth and Shiori sowed the seeds for something heavier. Shiori, quietly sets the stage for what could become the climax of her entanglement with Gonathon. The chessboard was being set.

But on the lighter, wholesome side—Fuwawa’s café finally got some visitors! Yay for the fluffy cook and her dream slowly coming true.

Brace yourself, though. This silence? It won’t last.
