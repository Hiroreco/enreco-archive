The Queen woke up with fire in her heart and vindication in mind. It was _on sight_ for the Hot Pink One, and she wasted no time telling Immerkind that it was, in fact, HPO who had spread rumors about her being [“far from kind”](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=264) right from day one. Naturally, the kind knight took offense and immediately started grilling the Hot Pink One. The Queen took this distraction as an opportunity to read a letter she’d received from Nino Ina. There was nothing like reading a heartfelt letter while your enemy was getting flamed in the background.

But alas, one could not win it all. Nino Ina chose not to take up the Queen’s offer to leave HPO and be with her—for Nino Ina did not wish to stray from [the path of a righteous hero](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=296). The Queen looked up at the sky exasperatedly, let out a deep sigh, and began taking out her frustration on HPO once more, who had somehow managed to save face with Immerkind. To this, the Queen remarked,

[“You couldn’t save OUR relationship now, could you?!”](#embed:https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=342)

One squabbling session later, Tam decided to take part in the auctioning event.

People say bravery requires one to be afraid of doing something but do it anyway despite the fear. Whatever possessed the Queen, it certainly was not bravery when she placed a bid of [ten thousand coins](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=785) at Mordon Ramsay’s auction—despite only having a little over a thousand to her name. Perhaps it was her newly regained bravado after her perceived triumph against HPO. Or maybe it was just good old-fashioned fear of missing out on flaunting her authority. The latter seemed more likely, as she backed out the moment it became clear she might actually _win_.

While checking out the new home that Immerkind and Gonathon had won from the auction, Queen Tam brought them up to speed on Nino Ina’s response—her decision not to be with either the Queen or HPO. This, in a technical sense, handed the win to Queen Tam, since HPO was now fated to live alone. An [empty and petty win for a petty queen](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1052). But one thing she _did_ have that HPO didn’t was the camaraderie and undying support of her fellow wolves in “the Wolfpack.” And so, she, Immerkind, and Gonathon howled in unison.

Next on the Queen’s agenda was a photoshoot with the other heroes who had helped save the world. Naturally, this included the Hot Pink One—and the Queen wasted no time engaging in their usual routine of shenanigans. She wanted the chair HPO was sitting on. She also remarked about the Hot Pink One having no one left by her side, all while [laughing evilly](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1446).

After that came a photoshoot with her [fellow Suppliers](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=1774)—Peasant the Bae and Immerkind—courtesy of Gonathon. It was then that the Queen realized there were only three of them in the group. This was followed by yet another shoot, this time with her fellow wolves in the Wolfpack: Gonathon, Immerkind, Shakira, Mordon Ramsay, and Nerissa. They shared their [final howls](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2252) together as Peasant the Bae snapped their photo.

Perhaps driven by a lingering sense of adventure—or simple curiosity about the Kingdom of Libestal in this timeline—Queen Tam formed one last adventuring party with her trusty knights Immerkind and Gonathon. Together, they ventured into the [Remnants of the Antigonian Aerie](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2481) to search for ancient tomes chronicling the kingdom’s lost history. Midway through their journey, the Queen received a [“spam letter"](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2587) from the Hot Pink One.

As they continued their small quest, Immerkind and Gonathon began discussing their hopes for the [next grand adventure](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=2760): saving Libestal’s griffins from extinction. Gonathon even suggested traveling further back into the past to do just that. The Queen, on the other hand, just wanted to go home. After all, she likely had better things to do than save some random majestic creatures.

On their way back to the kingdom for the victory banquet, Queen Tam stumbled upon an [unusual gathering of people](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3089) having their pictures taken: Shiori, Nerissa, Bijou, the Fuzzy One, and the Fluffy One. As far as the Queen knew, the only thing these people had in common was that they’d all been cursed to fight the heroes in the final dungeon and had to be freed from corruption.

Strangely, this inspired Immerkind to do the same. She and Gonathon sent messages to Roa Pandora and Lady Bloodflame, inviting them to take photos [“for justice,”](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3170) as Gonathon put it.

Then the Queen felt it too—deep in her heart, or perhaps from the abyss where the rest of her missing memories lay dormant—[a strong urge to gather Peasant the Bae and even the Hot Pink One](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3218) to capture their moment as well. The feeling must’ve reached Peasant the Bae too, because she was already calling the Queen with the same idea.

And so, on a deserted street—against a backdrop of the vast blue sky fading into space, the lush greens of nature, and the majestic structures of a thriving civilization—the three had their group photo taken.

[“…a promise to keep forever.”](#embed:https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3460)

At last, it was time for the victory banquet. There, Queen Tam and the others enjoyed [fireworks supplied by Peasant the Bae](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=3675). The sense of accomplishment was palpable, and spirits were high as the celebration commenced. Soon, the Outlander stepped forward to personally thank each hero for their bravery—for saving him and the kingdom from their grim fate.

That was when the gears of destiny started again, and the fate of the heroes reached a turning point. (see: [Outlander-Iphania: The Chains of Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander)).

Queen Tam Gandr could scarcely believe what was unfolding before her. Just as a newfound determination to save the world stirred in her chest, a betrayal cracked the bond the heroes had built. And as the [advent of seemingly wicked intentions](https://youtu.be/II40tjM-mxg?t=4199) came from the five individuals who sought to rebel, the Queen felt her strength drain from her body—and was claimed by slumber once more.

Only time will tell when the Queen shall rise again.
