**SHADOW**

There she stood. Awake in the dead of the night, [staring back at her portrait](https://youtu.be/MXqotm_8_Hc?t=228), entranced, she drowned in the deafening silence of a seemingly peaceful evening. Deep within, there was a storm brewing. All that pain she suffered from unrequited love... the anxiety that crawls into every bit of her nerves… The jealousy that stabbed her in the back gradually coalesced to form a maelstrom that could wreak havoc on anyone who stood in her way.

She was ready to exact revenge.

**BLOOD IN THE BREEZE**

Breaking from her own "spell," she went about her way, [killing the remnants of the Stains](https://youtu.be/MXqotm_8_Hc?t=483) that were left after the salvage of Libestal, destroying everything that came across her. Even an innocent cow was not spared from this woman’s rage.

**GAMBLING WITH FATE?**

Of course, nothing was more satisfying than spending time gambling after a hard day’s work. It was like opium—a drug that excited all her senses. The risk of losing and gaining had been quite the hobby for her. Much like losing oneself in the name of love. This time, it seems, it had become stronger than ever before.

She placed her lot—first, on all colors except blue. Although there was more to it than merely placing one’s bets. For she talked with the voices more audibly now that it did not matter if someone heard her. And her words… sounded deep and allegorical as she compared the persistence of colors at the strike of luck with how one persists in the hands of fate.

_“What is it you’re hoping for?”_

Nerissa felt rather than heard the words, her eyes fixated, determined, ahead. The color cannon was now loaded, and the voices continued to rise in volume as they placed their bets on the last surviving color… Inwardly, she argued and questioned why, despite all impossibility, some voices still insisted on asking for "red." Why, after all, keep holding onto hope? Why keep praying for miracles? When blue is inevitable. A destiny that could hardly be defied.

Another round went by; the voices continued to risk everything for the slightest chance of victory, while Nerissa kept denying herself any form of optimism, fully convinced that she could not escape her fate… that she did not need any saving.

But what if salvation comes in the color of scarlet? Brave. Persistent. Full of hope.

Her telekinesis device rang. It was a call from Lady Bloodflame. The fair knight asked her whereabouts, and as soon as she learned where, she immediately went up to meet her. As if providence was trying to prove the “Witch” wrong, “Red” stormed in to snatch her away from despair.

**LIKE A BURNING SUN**

Elizabeth came, and a light flickered in the jet-black room in her heart. That tiny flame, could it consume the darkness clouding her soul? The fair knight kept coming closer, and every time it felt like a scorching sun burning through her skin. It was not pleasant; thus, she tried to remain cold and distant. Unreciprocating her advances.

Will she truly be able to resist the knight's sweet gestures? Or would she finally show weakness and yield to her first love? (see: [Nerissa-Elizabeth](#edge:liz-nerissa))

**RENEGADES**

“_It seems like everyone is getting their happy ending_,” Nerissa muttered.

Her feelings were rather ambivalent, as if perhaps she was unsure about her own ending. Was it malice, forming deep within her heart? Or maybe it was uncertainty, the victory over the Heart of Ruin feeling unsatisfactory or incomplete to her? There was something odd about it all, afterall. All the clues she had gathered seemingly pointed to a different direction. Perhaps that last tome might have held more answers, if only she could have deciphered its obscure language.

One thing was for certain, however- something was wrong, and it was up to her to act on it.

Right before the victory banquet started, Nerissa [met up with Shiori Nyavella who happened to be with Princess Bijou](https://youtu.be/MXqotm_8_Hc?t=7518), who then claimed to have just become a witch. The jeweler expressed her desire to learn more from them, and the two were "kind" enough to accept her as apprentice. Shiori inquired if it would just be the three of them, to which Nerissa replied perhaps they could recruit two more. Thus, they called the Fluffy One and the Fuzzy One, for certainly, no apparent reason.

From henceforth, they shall be called "Coven Rebellion."

Would this coven be just another harmless faction? Or would they be a threat to the renewed peace in Libestal?
