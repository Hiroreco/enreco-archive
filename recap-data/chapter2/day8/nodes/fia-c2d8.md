<!-- title: Fia -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

Fia arrived just in time.

As the mysterious being prepared to pass divine judgment upon the heroes and the Outlander, a surge of radiant light shattered the oppressive silence—and from it, emerged Fia. With the wave of her hand, the crushing power bearing down on them dissipated, granting the heroes a breath of relief. Then, with calm resolve, she spoke—not just to clarify what had happened, but to reveal the truth of who she truly was.

She was Iphania.

The Princess of Libestal.

In the world she hailed from, the Curse had not been completely vanquished. At the moment of its defeat, it latched onto her cherished doll, embedding a fragment of itself within it—silent, patient, waiting. And when the time was right, it struck. Iphania was slain... or should have been. Yet in the same moment of her demise, something miraculous happened. Her consciousness, bound by the doll’s magic and sheer will, slipped away into the flow of time and space—until it eventually found its way to the Library.

There, she was reborn as Fia, the Librarian.

Though she assumed a new role, she never stopped thinking about the home she lost. Nor could she forget the nameless hero—the Outlander—who had fought so desperately to save her. It became her deepest wish: to save them both.

That wish reignited when she witnessed the heroes break through the prison that had trapped the Outsider, or to be more specific, the Outlander, defeating the Stain King and setting him free. She knew then—they were her hope. Her Shining Stars. The ones who could defy fate.

Even now, despite the knowledge that the Outsider’s birth was inevitable, there was still time to change what would come after. And so she extended her hand, asking them to stand with her in one final fight—to defy the impossible, and to create a future beyond fate’s design.

Most of them answered her call.

...

But not all.

Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and Shiori did not.

Something had changed within them. A darkness stirred, quiet at first, now fully bloomed. The warmth they once carried, the joy they once spread—it had twisted into something colder, sharper. A fire not of hope, but of rejection. They had no interest in saving the world nor the Outlander. 

> Eventually, the people you trust... the people you admire... they all turn on you.

They were done trusting. Done hoping. They would forge their own path—one shaped not by fate, nor by gods, nor by promises. They declared it proudly.

A rebellion.

And they welcomed anyone who might wish to join them.
