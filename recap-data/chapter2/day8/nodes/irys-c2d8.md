Less thrilled about the grand victory banquet and more consumed by unease, the pink one found herself fidgeting, nervously anticipating the response from her eternal consort. A letter had arrived—one penned by Ina—and though it wasn’t a definitive goodbye, it certainly wasn’t the answer the pink one had hoped for either.

The [lingering tension](https://www.youtube.com/live/kwmxMSD8tTU?t=1098) from the previous day with Tam also hadn’t dissipated. In fact, it only escalated. Whatever remnants of a bond once existed between the two were now thoroughly shattered, as their exchanges had devolved into open mockery and pointed jabs.

She didn’t do much that day—though to be fair, stirring chaos was practically her full-time job throughout the journey. Instead, she spent her final hours in the kingdom wandering, sharing light moments with the others. One last [mouth-to-mouth](https://www.youtube.com/live/kwmxMSD8tTU?t=2930) feeding with her cat, crafting a cursed chain-mail threatening [constipation](https://www.youtube.com/live/kwmxMSD8tTU?t=3137) to non-forwarders, and even a surprise group picture with Tam and the Peasant. As strained as things were, there remained a strange, inexplicable bond between the three—a connection forged in mischief, tension, and bizarre affection. That said, the pink one still wasn’t done throwing shade at Tam.

And then came the banquet.

What was meant to be a celebration turned into a revelation—a twist that no one saw coming. It marked the true end of the pink one’s chaotic chapter in this world... and the beginning of something entirely new.
