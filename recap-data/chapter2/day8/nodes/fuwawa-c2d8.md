The final day had arrived. With riches in hand, friendships forged, and dreams realized, Fuwawa had just about fulfilled everything she set out to do on this journey. Now, it was time to wind down, enjoy the company of those she cherished, and prepare for the grand banquet that marked the end of it all. Oh—and build a roof for her café. It wouldn't do to let customers get soaked in the rain, after all.

But before any of that, there was one last thing to do: gather everyone for a group picture. One final commemorative snapshot of this mysterious, chaotic, unforgettable adventure.

Afterward, Fuwawa returned to her beloved café, rolling up her sleeves for the final touch. She decided on a natural design: a canopy of green leaves and soft sakura petals draping elegantly over the bright quartz exterior. It gave the place a vibrant, inviting charm—cheerful and fluffy, just like its owner.

And just like that, it was done. Everything—_everything_—was complete. From having nothing to becoming the wealthiest; from being unknown to bringing smiles to countless faces with her cooking. Fuwawa had come so far, and she was endlessly grateful for everyone who had supported her along the way.

Still, something tugged at her heart. A subtle feeling, hard to explain, but it centered on four others—Nerissa, Mococo, Bijou, and Shiori. There was something special about this group. A deep resonance. Enough for her to imagine them not as passing allies, but as something more—something lasting. A group, a bond, a chosen family that would weather all storms together.

She penned her [final diary entry](https://www.youtube.com/live/9A1cO7jL0jw?t=3729), wrapping up her journey in Libestal with warm memories and hopeful thoughts. That lingering feeling, though—about those four—would soon prove to be more than just a whim.
