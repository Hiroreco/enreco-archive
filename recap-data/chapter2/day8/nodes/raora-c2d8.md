<!-- title: Roa Pandora -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

A successful business, companionship, and love. Roa's life reached its highest peaks and lowest points during her stay in Libestal. Through the suffering she endured, her perseverance paid off: Roa finally achieved the happiness she sought. There was little Roa could add to make her life better. But, as she watched Mordan build another house for the auction, [the chef suggested](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=596) a new house for the newlyweds.

Unfortunately, Roa was too broke to afford a new house. With the Gacharms' charms now obsolete, Roa turned to the jobs available. As she pondered by the Quest Board, Gonathon came by to congratulate her on her marriage. They traded pleasantries; Gonathon teasing Roa about her "special night" with Kiara, and Roa, in turn, asked if Gonathon had a special person in his life, to which he replied 'no.'

Now with a wife to support, Roa was back in the Remnant Fields, fulfilling her quota per quest taken. There, Roa met Bijou, who mentioned experiencing a strange dream last night. One where strange creatures stayed in her head. Roa mentioned that she, too, had a similar dream. Perhaps the [memory commission](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=1027) Roa received from Shiori would offer some clues.

Roa headed to Mordan's Tavern to meet Kiara and learned that there was a suite for the two of them. To celebrate their marriage and each other.

A scenic view, flower petals scattered around, music to set the mood, and some nice drinks. Specifically, invisibility potions. Kiara also received her... special fanfiction from Shiori earlier:

True love is rather impure at times, some would say. What transpired in the tavern could be left to your imagination, and a description of any sort wouldn't capture the insanity of this... moment.

After the romantic pet play passed between the two, they soon began a discussion about purchasing a home at the auction for their family. They toured the houses, noting which ones they liked, favoring the larger first house in particular.

With their efforts combined, Kiara and Roa won the auction for their dream house! Though the price was driven up by Bijou and, in her excitement, even Kiara herself.

And of course, a day in Libestal would not be complete without a controversy of some kind, as the hero Ina accused Mordan of copying the architectural design of Ina's home and thereby profiting from Ina's intellectual property.

And finally, to commemorate their journey, the heroes started taking pictures. Roa took one with [the whole group](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=4843) and another with her [Gacharms Co.](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=5136)

A small moment of respite, Roa started reading the memory she obtained from Shiori. It told her of strange, Gatorade-colored, furry beings begging for jetpacks from their mama and their rather peculiar love of cucumbers and pineapple on pizzas.

Since there was still time before the banquet was due to start, Roa spent a little bit more time with her friends, bonding with the Hot Pink One, purchasing some cake from Fuwawa's cafe, and adding some [decorations](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=5725) to her new home.

A little [gacha](https://youtu.be/neUwPDy7cbk?t=6977) didn't hurt either, since the money would be useless after today. She managed to win a few statues too, one of which was a familiar jade figurine.

And now to the banquet.
