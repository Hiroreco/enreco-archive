Mococo woke up from her bed with a funny feeling within her.

She felt different today, though she couldn't quite explain why. Mococo felt much more _feral_ than usual, as if something was gnawing at her canine instincts. Sometimes, it felt like a light headache that she could simply sleep on. Other times, it sounded like a ticking time bomb she couldn't cut the wires of—and it was only getting louder each time...

She knew that the others were going to worry about her. Roa was the first to notice. Her sister, Elizabeth, pulled her aside to check on her ~~(and talk about [touching feet](https://www.youtube.com/live/-vv8XkRzP_Y?si=iXAkiwtkoJKM9kmh&t=1277)).~~

Mococo joined everyone in a [picture to remember! ](https://www.youtube.com/live/-vv8XkRzP_Y?si=2LGw4sR2aKf6GdFD&t=1682)Shortly after, she received her first flying lesson and took a [photo with Gacharms](https://www.youtube.com/live/-vv8XkRzP_Y?si=3LsvcJs-3dmLcsFd&t=1966)—and one more just by [herself.](https://www.youtube.com/live/-vv8XkRzP_Y?si=PoQVz0TTgHhBVXLD&t=2243)

As the sun set in the distance, the doggy jeweler found it hard to sleep. So Mococo went snooping around people's houses to steal enigmatic stones and buy fireworks from the peasant.

Bijou called upon Mococo to arrive at the wagon to start a new group...

As Mococo noted in her last diary, she sensed that she was drawn closer to Shiori, Nerissa, Bijou, and, in particular, Fuwawa.
