After much reflection on the tangled web of emotions between her, her consort, and Tam, Ina came to a bittersweet conclusion—she needed more time. The pink one’s [letter](https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=205), filled with passion yet laced with confusion, only deepened the haze surrounding her heart. And so, Ina made her decision: she would write one final letter to her consort before stepping away, seeking peace and clarity in solitude. (see [Hot Pink One–Ina: So Long, Consort](#edge:ina-irys))

With that emotional weight set aside, Ina turned to enjoy what remained of the final day. She hoped for a calm, peaceful time... but peace was never quite guaranteed in this world. What followed was an unexpected dose of comedic frustration: the humble little home she had painstakingly built—bland by some standards but deeply personal to her—was straight-up [plagiarized](https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=1756) for an auction. When she tried to challenge the perpetrator, none other than the insufferably clever Mordan Ramsey, she found herself utterly outmatched.

Still, in the end, it was all in good fun.

She laughed with the others, took [commemorative photos](https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=2275) with the heroes she had fought beside, and shared warm moments with [her sister](https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=4638). For a time, it truly felt like the perfect ending to a chaotic, emotional, unforgettable journey.

Until it didn’t.
