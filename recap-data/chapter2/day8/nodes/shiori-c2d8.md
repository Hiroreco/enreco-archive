A writer's work was never done; there were countless stories to be written even as Shiori's script will soon conclude. It is with this in mind that Shiori found herself writing once again, in the early morning of Libestal, finishing the commissions she had left. Luckily, only a few remained—Kiara's rather [_suggestive_ fanfiction](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=553), Roa's memory, and Bijou's commission.

After finishing the newlywed couple's _spicy_ story, Shiori left for the Library to obtain another blank journal for Roa's memory. There, Shiori met her own wife, Bijou. They talk about how the banquet will be magnificent; nothing about it shall be dyed red, but if there will be red, it will be the red of love and hearts! Only trays of joy shall be served—not be*tray*als. [Things will be fine.](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=764)

They parted ways to settle some unfinished business, and Shiori found a quiet place to write. She looked for a memory in the Void. One from Before Libestal.

Shiori saw blue, furry, cat-like beings begging for jetpacks in her mind's eye. How they were upset when denied, but quickly rejoiced over the mention of cucumbers. She saw the bemused frown on the Pink Panther's face as she admonished the #########s. An occurrence that happened quite often to her amusement.

With the memory book now filled and the story done, Shiori gave them to their respective owners, even earning a nice tip from Kiara. Kindness given deserves kindness in turn, so Shiori gifted Kiara some [home cooking](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=1548) to thank her.

From the start of their journey to the end, the phoenix had been one of the kinder knights in Libestal to Shiori, especially, when compared to two particular Knights. Shiori genuinely enjoyed her company, and the two chatted a bit more. Shiori listened to Kiara fret over her wedding night as she gave out suggestions: some of the vegetables are rather potent and can be used as aphrodisiacs.

With too much time to spare, Shiori completed some quests and cooked a bit more, flipping through the pages of the cookbook to save in her collection before they parted this world. A picnic would be pleasant as well. Shiori invited Mordan, but though the chef had initially agreed, she was too busy preparing for her auction. Shiori appreciated Mordan's hard work as she took a quick tour of one of the houses, noting the resemblance to Ina's house and that Kiara would probably be bidding for one of them. Shiori considered a prank, hiding a jukebox to annoy the homeowner with music, but decided against it. Shiori Nyavella was a kind witch.

Leaving the chef to her business, Shiori invited Cecilia to the picnic. They talked about how they can't wait for the party later, how fireworks would suit the occasion, and jumping over the campfire. And, of course, gossip about the rather _complicated_ relationships in Libestal and the drama it had produced. But each person was truly the hero of their own story; it was their tale to tell while others were but a part of it, be they minor or background characters or the villains. In the end, they were part of a larger, grander epic.

With her main commissions out of the way and hunger satiated, there wasn't much for Shiori to do. She found herself cooking again, venturing to the Remnant Fields briefly to collect gold and milk for a recipe. As Shiori headed back, [she heard Ina's sorrows](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=4091) as the hero wrote a letter to a certain pink someone. Roa was also nearby, relaxing in the onsen, soon telling Shiori of the happy night the pink cat shared with Kiara.

Speaking of beloveds, Shiori met up with Bijou once again during Mordan's auction. She wondered if they would need a new house, but Bijou was already content with the GothRock they already had, her Jeweled One said as she looked at Shiori fondly. The two watched as the rest of their friends bought houses to start their wonderfully short lives in Libestal. Things were peaceful before a confrontation inevitably came to pass, as Mordan was accused of intellectual theft by Ina. A matter that was dropped and forgotten soon after, as they no longer had the time to fit in another dramatic scenario.

For a moment, Shiori was filled with ire as she saw that the fields were [not replanted properly](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=5334) once again. It was probably the Fuzzy one, Shiori assumed, since the demon dog had been acting rather off in the past few days. Perhaps this world deserved to _burn_.

The chefs took another commemorative photo together. Well, after almost everyone fought Mordan to let out some steam since the reaper kindly offered to be the Hot Pink's punching bag. As they talked about their final day, they congratulated Fuwawa on her successful business; from catering the disastrous party to selling quite a bit of her food, the Fluffy One probably being the one who earned the most money amongst them.

Left to her devices, but not for long, as Bijou would join her shortly after. [From a hole.](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6167) It was just a hole, albeit a rather deep one. Shiori conspired with Bijou to enact the prank she had thought of earlier, even grander, as they could build a tunnel of love that could connect from this strange hole and then add bonfires and ticking noises to further annoy others. But that must wait until the next chapter.

But as they planned the prank, Mordand and Bae came by, since Bae was planning to buy one of Mordan's houses. Shiori and Bijou attempted to outbid Bae for the house before soon withdrawing as they [remembered Bae has kids now](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6411), one of whom was their own, and they have visitation anyway. State Farm will be much closer now, though Bae would soon leave Libestal with her kids after the banquet, to the couple's surprise.

As a final mischief, Shiori and Bijou sneaked into Mordan's Tavern, criticizing the surprising lack of pillows and proper bedding in the establishment. It doesn't seem very comfortable to stay in, but they didn't have to, [_as Mordan noticed_](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6716) their trespassing soon enough. Not to worry, since they escaped using the magic map.

As they dodged paying for the room, fellow witch Nerissa called for them to meet by the wagon. It seemed that just the three of them for the Coven was not enough... [They can corrupt more innocents](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6824) to indoctrinate and add to their numbers. The Fluffy and Fuzzy Ones, in particular, were a splendid choice. Libestal was strange and chaotic. To protect themselves, it was best to band together. The five of them were much more at ease with each other; even when their memories, except Shiori's, were fragmented and incomplete, there was a gravity that pulled them to each other. A dark bond reforged in the trials they recently faced.

Even as Advent affirmed in this timeline, there were still a few things to remember from Shiori and Bijou's short stay. A little view of their own, GothRock wouldn't be remiss, a home that saw many of the events transpire. Even the outside toilet may be missed. So, they lingered for a moment before writing about their final day. And to make the [final entry special](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=7478), Shiori grabbed the diary in the latrine for that final smelly majestic use.

After much waiting, the not-red banquet had begun! Everyone cheered as the second part of their journey was officially over, letting out "Huzzahs" and firing fireworks into the flammable decor of the Great Hall. Shiori watched from the sidelines, celebrating with them as she ate a bit before the food could be served. She enjoyed the moment for just that. A moment. Jubilation and "wooden shovels" consumed the conversations Shiori could hear, though that didn't matter for long. Soon, Shiori Nyavella's role will end, and a new one will begin.

A scream echoed through the castle, and soon it would be heard throughout Libestal. Shiori let out a small laugh.

A voice thundered through the halls as malice filled the air.

(See:[Outlander-Iphania](#edge:iphania-outlander)).

**_Nothing Stays Pure_**

It was cute to see the heroes swear to try and save the world after failing... was it twice now? Pitiable. Shiori watched the Time Warden, or lovely _Queen Tam Gandr_ in this tale, promise Fia, the original _Iphania_, a brighter future. To try to overturn the Chains of Fate once more.

Well, we can't have that now, can we? Repeating the same story so soon would be rather... stale. A good continuation needs a little change to set up a new arc with new challenges for our _beloved_ heroes to face. But like with every story, an antagonist is needed.

Every hero has a villain—be it herself, nature, or _another_.

"You think you can just set things right... Fix what's broken?"

Shiori Nyavella tried her best to be kind to those around her; though she may be a bit mischievous at times, it was mostly harmless. True, some appreciated her kindness, but there are those the Archiver's eyes lingered on a few of Shiori's... former friends; there are those who were un*just*ly cruel to Nyavella.

Shiori's golden eyes glowed as she turned to the three goddess-like beings, avatars who were part of a Council that became a Promise, who stood against Advent. Her gaze caught, and she smirked. It looks like her little coven of witches, Shiori's Advent, _won't_ be quite alone in the next chapter.

**Bonds** forged yesterday are now **broken** today.
