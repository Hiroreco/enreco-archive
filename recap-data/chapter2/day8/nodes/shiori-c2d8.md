<!-- title: Shiori Nyavella -->
<!-- status: Alive -->

A writer's work was never done; a book must end for another to begin and Shiori's script, too, will soon conclude. It is with this in mind that Shiori found herself writing once again, finishing her last commissions. Only a few remained—Kiara's rather [_suggestive_ fanfiction](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=553) and Roa's memory.

After finishing the newlywed couple's _spicy_ story, Shiori left for the Library to obtain another blank journal for Roa's memory. There, Shiori met her own wife, Bijou. They talk about how the banquet will be magnificent; nothing about it shall be dyed red, but if there will be red, it will be the red of love and hearts! Only trays of joy shall be served—not be*tray*als. [Things will be fine.](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=764)

In a quiet space, Shiori saw a memory; blue, furry, cat-like beings begging for jetpacks in her mind's eye. How they were upset when denied, but quickly rejoiced over the mention of cucumbers. She saw the bemused frown on the Pink Panther's face as she admonished the #########s. An occurrence that happened quite often to Shiori's amusement.

With commissions done, Shiori delivered each to their respective owners, earning a nice tip from Kiara. Kindness given deserves kindness in turn, so Shiori gave Kiara some of her own [home cooking](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=1548). From the start to near the end, the phoenix had been one of the kinder knights to Shiori, compared to two particular knight. Shiori enjoyed Kiara's company, taking the time to listen to Kiara fretting about her wedding knight and giving out suggestions: some vegetables are rather... _potent_.

There wasn't much left for Shiori to do. A few quests and cooking filled was had. Shiori learned that Mordan would later host an auction for the houses she was building the past few days. The chef was certainly a better house-builder than a therapist, in Shiori's eyes. For a brief mischievious moment, Shiori considered pranking Mordan by placing some jukeboxes underneath the houses but dismissed the thought. Shiori Nyavella _was_ a kind witch.

The picnic with Cecilia was also rather nice, the two trading small talk over the _complicated_ relationships and resulting dramas. About how each person was the hero of their own story; it was their tale while others were but a part of it. Such as Roa attaining her own happy ending with Kiara after days of turmoil. Even the Hero Ina had [her own struggles](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=4091), Shiori accidentally eavesdropping as Ina wrote a letter to her own paramour. But in the end, they were part of a larger, grander epic.

Shiori's own tale was winding down. With her beloved Bijou, they watched Mordan's auction unfold. Friends bought houses to stay and build a new start to their lives. Shiori wondered if they should buy a house of their own, but Bijou refused. She looked at Shiori fondly, saying she was content and happy with the GothRock they already had. A tender moment that was briefly interrupted by another scandal: Mordan Ramsey was accused of intellectual theft by Ina. A scandal that was soon dropped since our heroes have limited run time.

Their time in Libestal wouldn't be complete without commemorative photos. One with everyone in the Library where their adventure started and another one with all the chefs together, giving their congratulations to Fuwawa's success afterwards.

Bijou popped out [from a hole](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6167) to Shiori's surprise. It was just a hole, albeit a rather deep one. One where the two conspired to possibly create a tunnel of love that could be used to prank others, hiding ticking noises to disturbed the residents that lived above the future tunnel. A prank they immediately hushed by Mordan's and Bae's arrival. Bae planned to buy one of the houses and though Shiori and Bijou first attempted to outbid her, both of them withdrawed, [remembering that Bae has kids now](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6411), one of which was their own. And they have visitation, though Bae would soon leave with the kids after the banquet to Shiori's surprise.

As one last prank, Shiori and Bijou sneaked into Mordan's Tavern where they criticized its lack of proper bedding. Their tresspassing was [soon noticed](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6716) but not to worry, since had their magic map. Soon the two of them met with with fellow witch Nerissa. The three of them agreed that three for a Witches Coven was not enough, [they can indoctrinate more](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=6824) and add to their numbers. The Fluffy and Fuzzy Ones, in particular, were a splendid choice. Libestal was strange and chaotic land. And they can count on each to protect themselves. Though their memories, barring Shiori's, of before Libestal were fragmented, there was a... gravity that pulled them to each other.

There were still a few things to remember from Shiori and Bijou's short stay. They lingered. Their GothRock shouldn't be remiss, it was a home that saw many moments. Even the outside toilet may be missed. And to make the [final entry special](https://youtu.be/jh0GSZRpkfU?t=7478), Shiori grabbed the diary in the latrine for that final smelly majestic use.

Finally, the not-red banquet had begun! Shiori watched as everyone cheered as the second part of their journey was officially over, letting out "Huzzahs" and firing fireworks into the flammable decor of the Great Hall. She enjoyed the moment for just that. A moment. Jubilation and "wooden shovels" consumed the conversations Shiori could hear, though that didn't matter for long. Soon, Shiori Nyavella's role will end, and a new one will begin.

A scream echoed through the castle, throughout Libestal.

A malicious voice thundered through the halls.

(See:[Outlander-Iphania](#edge:iphania-outlander)).

**_Nothing Stays Pure_**

It was cute to see the heroes swear to try and save the world after failing... was it twice now? Pitiable. Shiori watched the Time Warden, or lovely _Queen Tam Gandr_ in this tale, promise Fia, the original _Iphania_, a brighter future. To try to overturn the Chains of Fate once more.

Well, we can't have that now, can we? Repeating the same story so soon would be rather... stale. A good continuation needs a little change to set up a new arc with new challenges for our _beloved_ heroes to face. But like with every story, an antagonist is needed.

Every hero has a villain—be it herself, nature, or _another_.

"You think you can just set things right... Fix what's broken?"

Shiori Nyavella tried her best to be kind to those around her; though she was a bit mischievous at times. Some appreciated her kindness, but there are those the Archiver's eyes lingered on a few of Shiori's... former friends; there are those who were un*JUST*ly cruel to Nyavella.

Her eyes glowed as she turned to the three goddess-like beings, avatars who were part of a Council that became a Promise, who stood against Advent. Her gaze caught, and she smirked. It looks like her little coven of witches, Shiori's Advent, _won't_ be quite alone in the next chapter.

**Bonds** forged yesterday are now **broken** today.

**_"Who's... With Us?"_**
