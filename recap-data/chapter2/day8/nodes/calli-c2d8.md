**HOME FOUND**

On the last day, Mordan Ramsey resumed building houses for the upcoming auction. It was business as usual. Even so, she wondered what to do with the money she had earned. Perhaps she could buy another ring and marry someone special, but she had long decided that married life wasn't one for the therapist.

Instead, she thought that she should expand her hand-built neighborhood into a little town called [Mordanville.](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=840)

INSPIRED OR COPIED?

With no more time to spare, Mordan started the bidding war for the three houses she had built. That is, before [home inspections revealed holes in the walls](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?t=4991), which Mordan immediately patched up.

The jeweler accused Mordan of plagiarizing Ina's house; from the brick foundation to the stone rooftops, it was almost the same in look—which was definitely not true! Mordan called for the original patent of the purple one's house plan.

The patent that Ina soon showed seemed to be drawn on a napkin—something Mordan loudly mocked.

In the end, Bae bought it for 2000 coins.

Mordan knew that she would miss these moments with everyone, and she needed to cherish them the best she could. Thus, she took a picture with [the chefs](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?si=6XoSGMMzfTlRSZ0V&t=6193) and another with the rest of [the wolf pack!](https://www.youtube.com/live/Ch4qLZhARtY?si=uNJIZEhlu-vuZzXE&t=6784)

As fireworks lit up the twilight sky, the banquet had begun—but sadly, even laughter couldn't silence the fate that was fast approaching.
