#### Main Story

The final day brought an unexpected twist. As the heroes celebrated their hard-won victory over the corruption at the banquet, the Curse—somehow still alive—struck again, emerging from the shadows to slay Princess Iphania.

Before the heroes could react, a mysterious and cryptic being appeared—one that seemed to shatter time and space itself. It condemned the Outlander and the heroes for defying fate, asserting that their actions defied the grand design.

But just as it prepared to strike them down, Fia intervened. She pulled the heroes into another time leap within the Library, narrowly escaping the entity’s wrath.

Having now recovered all of her memories, Fia revealed a painful truth: in her past life, before becoming the keeper of the Library, she had been Iphania. She too had met a tragic fate. The Curse had hidden a fragment of itself inside her beloved doll, waiting patiently until the moment of triumph to reemerge and take her life. But before she fully perished, her soul fused with the doll, allowing her consciousness to persist. Drifting through time and space, she eventually arrived at the Library and became its keeper.

Now, knowing the past could no longer be changed, Fia resolved to shift her focus to the present—and the future. She declared her intent to face the Outsider head-on and asked the heroes to stand with her once more.

Most agreed. However, **Mococo**, **Fuwawa**, **Bijou**, **Nerissa**, and **Shiori** refused. As if once again touched by the Curse, the five broke away, rejecting Fia’s plan and declaring they would follow their own path instead.
