<!-- title: Princess Iphania -->
<!-- status: Dead -->

The happiest day—a day of celebration, of laughter, of basking in the joy of a world saved from calamity. That was what the Princess had hoped for, what she longed for, what she believed this day would be.

But no one expected—least of all her—that amidst all the joy, this day would also mark her end.
