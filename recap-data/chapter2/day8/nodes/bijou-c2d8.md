As with the others, today was a day of celebration and goodbyes. Though, surprisingly, new bonds formed as well.

It wasn’t a day without some eavesdropping either. She had woken up on Shiori’s bed again, coming off a dream about watching Pokémon movies. Shiori was already up, writing someone’s commission in the center of the room. Bijou warped away just as she finished to avoid getting caught.

She comes across Shiori anyway in the library. They theorize what may happen at the banquet; surely nothing bad will happen, right? ……Right?

---

Bijou realized she had not completed the library’s lore archives for herself, so she set off to collect the books she had missed. She was essentially taking a walk through memory lane through the areas the warriors had wandered this past week. Upon collecting them all, she started reading them out loud to herself and the voices in her head.

Cecilia Immerkind also came by while she was reading. The delusional knight was fully aware that they would leave this point in time soon. Bijou assures her that everyone’s memories of each other, the Libestans, and the adventures of the past week will be remembered.

That was her reasoning for collecting all the books she could find, after all.

Bijou happened to stop by the Hot Pink One’s house, [overhearing](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=3830) a talk between her and Immerkind. Seeing her at the door, HPO immediately asked why she was next to… “the murderer” (Mococo was next to her outside, referring to yesterday’s “incident”).

As if the trauma of yesterday wasn’t enough, the HPO got a letter… from her consort (see [Hot Pink One](#node:irys)). Queen Tam also showed up at this time, though IRyS [demanded](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4028) that her brother stay away from her.

Bijou started to feel suffocated in the tense atmosphere. She clutched her map to cope, but even that didn’t feel like enough. As if by magic, the appearance of the fluffy one was able to calm her down. Her presence alone was able to soothe her.

Guiding map in hand, Bijou continued to eavesdrop anyway. She had to call her sister to check in with her, but… she was at Mordan's house auction.

---

Apparently, it was true that Ina was to set out on a journey following the victory banquet. Though, she still needed a house to come back to, so she wanted to join the auction.

Bijou supported her sister’s journey to find her revelation. She also realizes she has a home to return to of her own, the one of her dearly belove. She was content with sharing it with her. Even though she knew a body may soon be buried underneath.

…But she would bid for one of the houses anyway. [“Seven thousand!”](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4531) (_She only had 5,485 coins remaining._)

The final day would not have been complete without one huge scandal, now would it? After Shakira and Roa won the second house auction, Ina [began to realize](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=46806) her house design had been stolen by Mordan…

Peasant Bae was thinking of snatching the last house as part of her retaliation, but Bijou decided to take it into her own hands on her sister’s behalf.

[STOP THE AUCTION!](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4820)

An argument ensued between Ina and Mordan, which ended in the latter running away. Everyone chased her down like a mob with pitchforks and torches. Like a light switch, the topic suddenly changed to the victory banquet. Problem solved! I guess?

---

Mordan also had the bright idea of taking a group photo before the banquet, anticipating the end of their time in Past Libestal.

Their first stop was the **library**, where this chapter started. Without Fia, they would not have been saved from the false Libestal and taken back in time. Bijou was called out for being short and thus was put front and center. She was the one to take the picture though!

---

The banquet was not for another 40 minutes, so the warriors decided to take more group photos on their own.

Bijou called the jewelers for a group photo at [Gacharm](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5232). Though it was Roa’s business in the end, the sparkling gem pulled a lot of weight on her own. She developed the gacha ticket system, and she worked tirelessly to craft and mine for the charms they sold. Arguably, the success of the business came from her—the literal jewel of the company.

They first took a photo while flying in front of the [floating sign](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5442) above the shop—it was Mococo’s first time with the Magic Feather. Then they went inside for one last photo.

[Tiny treasures, infinite pleasure!](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5552)

---

Soon after the four jewelers finished taking group photos, they received word from on high that the banquet was to start in 30 minutes.

Bijou’s map led her to Mordan’s tavern; there was a commotion coming from underground, and she could hear all of it…

It was the last day—she decided to [break the first rule of The Basement](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5625) within earshot of Mordan. She came outside and retaliated, and so did Nerissa.

“DON’T TREAT MY BROTHER LIKE THAT!” It was IRyS. Bijou wasn’t fazed by what had just happened; she was fine. They touched base about Ina and what Bijou told her.

It seems like there might still be a chance for the couple—at least that’s what IRyS thinks, assuming what Kronii got from Ina was a rejection letter. [“Why are you laughing like that?”](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5728)

She [called her stepmom](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5854) in response to the suspicious laughter.

---

The time of the banquet drew closer.

A brief detour after the call led Bijou and down a [random hole](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5970) someone seemed to have dug down. They went further down and were surprised by how far down they could reach.

Shiori noticed this too. She theorized a plan for the future to make a secret tunnel system under everyone’s homes. Perhaps for another time, on another adventure.

Peasant Bae would later come to [buy](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6257) the last house from earlier, only for a measly 2000 coins. At least she’s not homeless anymore. That’s good, right? Hope the children are happy now. Forget the fact that the roof is lopsided.

Since everyone was busy taking pictures, Shiori and Bijou [visited the tavern](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6508) one last time. It was only cut short as Mordan drew near. Though they didn’t get to see The Basement, their bond seemed to have improved from their short visit.

The two teleported and ran far away from the tavern. Soon after, Shiori got a call from Nerissa to meet up. They do so near the wagon. Now, as a member of her coven, Bijou expresses great eagerness to learn her witchy ways sometime in the future.

It was brought up that they could try [recruiting](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6725) some innocent ones. Fuwawa and Mococo came to mind immediately. Fuwawa’s worth as a chef was proven near the end of the week, while Mococo was all about the money from the start.

Arguably, they could use a little guidance. The fluffy and fuzzy ones were summoned, and together they all formed an alliance. From that day forward, they all vowed to protect one another. The Coven “Rebellion” had been formed. The voices in their heads stirred, almost as if this particular group of five was destined to be!

[An **Advent** of something new…](#embed:https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6784)

To commemorate this moment, they took a [group photo](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6895) together; they were among one of the last to gather for one. Tam, Immerkind, and Gonathan helped take photos for them as well.

_”The banquet will begin in 5 minutes.”_

Now of their own coven, Shiori and Bijou said their farewells to the Building Area, and by extension their house. Bijou decided to carry her egg and one of Shiori’s seeds with her.

She took a pit stop at the outhouse before they left for the banquet. …But she took this as an excuse to “love maps” one last time, overhearing a photo op between Gonathan and Shiori. Even as she was summoned to the Great Hall, she decided to sneak in [one last journal entry](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=7324) and a selfie with her knight Immerkind before leaving.

---

The banquet was finally about to happen. The warriors gathered at the [Great Hall](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=7428), practically jumping in their seats in excitement. Everyone said their last goodbyes in advance; for Bijou, she bid farewell to her sister.

…This was their final moment of peace. Their celebration would be interrupted by divine forces beyond their control.

Nothing stays pure forever, they say.

Our innocent former princess… may not be so pure after all, after what she’s gone through this past week. _...So much for reform._

We’ll see what the next chapter brings.
