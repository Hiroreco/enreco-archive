As with the others, today was a day of celebration and goodbyes. Though, surprisingly, new bonds formed as well.

It wasn’t a day without some [eavesdropping](https://www.youtube.com/live/C6kmnHsopgM?si=avfoBgSKUq9BJzvQ&t=268) either. She had woken up on Shiori’s bed again, coming off a dream about watching Pokémon movies. Shiori was already up, writing someone’s commission in the center of the room. Bijou warped away just as she finished to avoid getting caught.

She comes across Shiori anyway in the Library. They theorize what may happen at the banquet; surely nothing bad will happen, right? …Right?

Bijou realized she had not completed the Library’s lore archives for herself, so she set off to collect the books she had missed. She was essentially taking a walk through memory lane through the areas the warriors had wandered this past week. Upon collecting them all, she started reading them out loud to herself and the voices in her head.

Immerkind also came by while she was reading. The delusional knight was fully aware that they would leave this point in time soon. Bijou assures her that everyone’s memories of each other, the Libestans, and the adventures of the past week will be remembered.

That was her reasoning for collecting all the books she could find, after all.

Later on, Bijou happened to stop by the Hot Pink One’s house, [overhearing](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=3830) a talk between her and Immerkind. Seeing her at the door, HPO immediately asked why she was next to… “the murderer” (Mococo was next to her outside, referring to yesterday’s “incident”).

As if the trauma of yesterday wasn’t enough, the HPO got a letter… from her consort. Queen Tam also showed up at this time, though IRyS [demanded](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4028) that her brother stay away from her.

Bijou started to feel suffocated in the tense atmosphere. She clutched her map to cope, but even that didn’t feel like enough. As if by magic, the appearance of the fluffy one was able to calm her down. Her presence alone was able to soothe her.

One [auctioning session](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=4531) later, Mordan also had the bright idea of taking a group photo before the banquet, anticipating the end of their time in Past Libestal.

Their first stop was the **Library**, where this chapter started. Without Fia, they would not have been saved from the false Libestal and taken back in time. Bijou was called out for being short and thus was put front and center. She was the one to take the picture though!

Bijou then called the jewelers for a group photo at [Gacharm](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5232). Though it was Roa’s business in the end, the sparkling gem pulled a lot of weight on her own. She developed the gacha ticket system, and she worked tirelessly to craft and mine for the charms they sold. Arguably, the success of the business came from her—the literal jewel of the company.

The time of the banquet drew closer.

A brief detour after led Bijou and down a [random hole](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=5970) someone seemed to have dug down. They went further down and were surprised by how far down they could reach. Shiori noticed this too. She theorized a plan for the future to make a secret tunnel system under everyone’s homes. Perhaps for another time, on another adventure.

Since everyone was busy taking pictures, Shiori and Bijou [visited the tavern](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6508) one last time. It was only cut short as Mordan drew near. Though they didn’t get to see The Basement, their bond seemed to have improved from their short visit.

Soon after, Shiori got a call from Nerissa to meet up. They do so near the wagon. Now, as a member of her coven, Bijou expresses great eagerness to learn her witchy ways sometime in the future.

It was brought up that they could try [recruiting](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6725) some innocent ones. Fuwawa and Mococo came to mind immediately. Fuwawa’s worth as a chef was proven near the end of the week, while Mococo was all about the money from the start.

Arguably, they could use a little guidance. The fluffy and fuzzy ones were summoned, and together they all formed an alliance. From that day forward, they all vowed to protect one another. The Coven “Rebellion” had been formed. The voices in their heads stirred, almost as if this particular group of five was destined to be!

To commemorate this moment, they took a [group photo](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=6895) together; they were among one of the last to gather for one. Tam, Immerkind, and Gonathon helped take photos for them as well.

_”The banquet will begin in 5 minutes.”_

Now of their own coven, Shiori and Bijou said their farewells to the Building Area, and by extension their house. Bijou decided to carry her egg and one of Shiori’s seeds with her.

She took a pit stop at the outhouse before they left for the banquet. …But she took this as an excuse to “love maps” one last time, overhearing a photo op between Gonathon and Shiori. Even as she was summoned to the Great Hall, she decided to sneak in [one last journal entry](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=7324) and a selfie with her knight Immerkind before leaving.

The banquet was finally about to happen. The warriors gathered at the [Great Hall](https://youtu.be/C6kmnHsopgM?t=7428), practically jumping in their seats in excitement. Everyone said their last goodbyes in advance; for Bijou, she bid farewell to her sister.

…This was their final moment of peace. Their celebration would be interrupted by divine forces beyond their control.

Nothing stays pure forever, they say.

Our innocent former princess… may not be so pure after all, after what she’s gone through this past week. _...So much for reform._

We’ll see what the next chapter brings.
