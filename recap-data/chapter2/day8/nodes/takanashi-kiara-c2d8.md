With the kingdom saved, it was time to celebrate!

Kiara and Roa spent a night together and bought a new home at Mordan's auction. (See [Kiara-Raora: And so, Sesbian Lex.](#edge:roa-pandora-takanashi-kiara-left-2-left-2))

Before moving in with her new wife, Kiara [extended her gratitude](https://www.youtube.com/live/8E8Dsgs5e50?t=4555) towards Elizabeth for being able to tolerate her antics in the Jade Forge. Admitting this broke her heart, to say the least. She had built this place with Elizabeth, and the phoenix didn't want her best friend to feel left alone—*even if they were going to be neighbors*.


Fortunately, Liz was already happy for her! She thanked Kiara for being her wonderful roommate and sugar mama. Both agree that even despite going their separate ways, their friendship would always stay the same.

As everyone partied at the Great Hall, a scream pierced through the walls. In one of the other rooms, there lay the princess Iphania, who had fallen dead to the floor. Kiara could not help but wonder [how Immerkind would react to such an ending...](https://www.youtube.com/live/8E8Dsgs5e50?t=6916)
