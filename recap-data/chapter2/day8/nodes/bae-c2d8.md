It was quite surreal. The journey was finally over, and Bae could finally return and live her life in the woods, and find that blasted box of hers too while she was at it.

But it seemed peace wasn't felt by all—Queen Tammy and... Oh, it's [the Hot Pink One again](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=289). We're having a spat. They looked to be fine at first, but then the goddess magically disappeared from the Queen's eyes, becoming little less than wind—a rather noisy one.

And speaking of fresh air, Fuwawa, the blessing that she truly is in this world, shared some of [her wonderful cooking with Bae.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=390) Though Bae would have to wait to eat the tart, she was nonetheless enthused by the gift.

An auction! After days of preparation, Mordan Ramsey's auction was finally underway. Eyeing one house, Bae offered her price... [a joke!](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=637) All seemed jolly, but it seemed the occasion left Ina the Hero in a dour mood. In a grave _InaJustice_, [Ina's design](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=719), the architectural design of her own home, was stolen! The chef had copied Ina's house, from the bricks used to the window design. Seeing this unfold, Bae quickly stepped in and added a title to her name. (And another line to the _chart_.)

It was a fierce case, fought bravely for less than 5 minutes. A totally proper, patented patent, not written on a scrappy piece of paper, changed the course of the trial. With this revealed, the chef went on a run... for a few steps. Since there was no court to truly prosecute a crime, it was but a silly moment for everyone.

Now, time to remember this chapter with pictures!

[Group Photo in the Library](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1190)

Shortly after the photo, Bae's two Promise members were still fighting. Bae watched as they walked while trading barbs and insults. To her shock, Bae learned that the Hero had [**_dumped_** the goddess.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1370)

Not having one last group photo with her fellow suppliers would be amiss. Though Bae and Cecilia were still rather awkward after the rejection, they were still cordial. It was during their talk that Bae found out [there were only three suppliers](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1413) in the whole kingdom.

They ventured back to where they first mined. It was a perfect spot to capture their last meeting before going their separate ways. Gonathon agreed; he might be a humble knight, but Bae's brother was a truly talented photographer. Capturing multiple angles, suggesting poses, and encapsulating the candid moments truly exemplified his experience with the camera.

Bae returned the favor, taking photos of Gonathon and his fellow pack in front of Mordan's Tavern... shortly after [Mordan's prank faded,](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=1921) their [photo was taken.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2097)

As Bae left, one of the houses in the auction caught her eye. An interesting one, a 7LDK (seven bedrooms, a living room, dining room, and kitchen), was up for sale, though... [its roof seemed to be quite avant-garde](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2234) Shiori and Bae competed to buy the house before the writer remembered that Bae has kids now (one of whom was hers and Bijou's) and gracefully bowed out. But not before Bijou upped the price to 2,000 gold.

[A Home to Return](#embed:https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2357)

As the co-parents talked, Bae told them of her plans to finally leave this accursed Libestal and run back to the woods, this time bringing Khaos and Chaoz with her. There, Bae will teach [them the way of the Peasants.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2484) Truly, Bae is the Peasant Parent (PP) that stepped up.

As she went home to gather her kids to bring them to the banquet with her, Mococo came by to visit. The demon dog curiously looked over Bae's supplies and home. Still a supplier at heart, Bae would trade a few of the colorful fireworks, the same ones she painstakingly suffered to create, with Mococo.

Now, with the kids in tow, Bae left the home that brought her much.

After destroying IRyS's property, breaking her jukebox, and setting off fireworks inside her shop, Bae finally questioned IRyS on what happened between her and Kronii yesterday. [Bae immediately doubted IRyS's answer,](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=2984) knowing Kronii was mostly reasonable at times and IRyS was IRyS. Still, today was their last day, and amends would be attempted for a group photo. Bae extended the olive branch to her Queen, which was reciprocated.

And of course, a final diary entry. A final message... GOODBYE LIBESTAL. With that, Bae was done.

Huzzah! The banquet is here! Fireworks were shared and fired within range of flammable materials in an enclosed environment. Joy was had, and the celebrations resounded throughout the halls.

All was right! [Well, except for some last-minute cannibalism.](https://youtu.be/NL8O6nH1UE0?t=3634)

A scream.
