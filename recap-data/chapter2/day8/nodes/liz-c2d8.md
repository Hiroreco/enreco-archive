**Knight's Log 006**

A knight of honor. Smith of the Jade Forge. Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame.

[Spilled ink, soaked in sorrow](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=-HpFkakfPqE6y6EO&t=363). Written words of emotions across pages filled with lies. Fragile memories sold for coin. Works of a true witch.

If the ink speaks the truth, then [let me forget](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=9ftHdvHFDe7BKzLe&t=410). Let me live in a world where the truth is the lie and the lie is the truth.

What is fear? Not for oneself, but for someone else. What quells the flame of concern?

Nerissa's possession of her body had instilled in me a fear that I was too late. Was purifying her enough? Had the time I spent calling her a witch caused so much damage that she turned?

She is the light of my flame. The flickers of emotions, the lick of heat against my skin. She is the rose above the thorns that cut.

_"What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other word would smell as sweet."_

As day breaks, Elizabeth seeks out Nerissa without hesitation. When the knock on the door goes unanswered, she moves to check the windows, disappointed not to see her present. A quick call remedies the situation.

They joke about the music, the looping track that still drives Elizabeth crazy. An invitation inside with a quick pass to hold the ring given to her days ago. Proof that she's not a witch—it's nothing more than a magic trick with looping discs.

In the back of her mind sits the warning from Kiara about apologies and corrections, yet her tongue sits too heavy to speak the words still.

Back upstairs in Nerissa's home, she notes the roses and ring frame on the wall—gifts she had given. Taking the ring off the wall, Nerissa wears hers to match the one Elizabeth is wearing.

_Promise rings. Nothing more._

Then Nerissa requests a spar, something they've been doing daily now. And yet, Elizabeth makes an even stranger request: to go gambling (see: [Nerissa-Elizabeth: Finding Shelter in the Shadows of Hope](#edge:liz-nerissa)).

Back at home, a [heart-to-heart with Kiara](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=oGPHYYz-3nlKro3Y&t=4582) reveals their shared nature as knights—both in thought and action. A reminder that Kiara is moving out is painful for Elizabeth, but she’s happy for her friend.

But Kiara doesn’t let things slide. She asks about Nerissa, about the blue that feels like it lights the flame of her chest. What is she to Elizabeth? A few [joke names](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=E3oALHLYZAo5suDE&t=4950) are tossed around: Princess of Blue, of Gambling, of Sound, of... Potato Salad?

"Princess of her heart," Kiara says.

The words catch Elizabeth off guard, but she doesn’t deny them. Red in the face, she tries to accept that Nerissa is just another person close to her heart.

With the chat with Kiara concluded, Elizabeth moves to find Nerissa once again, replicating something unique to them.

[“Juliet, Juliet!”](#embed:https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=wW_PnKZylMBJiFeK&t=5150)

Though neither remembers the lines fully, it is a cheerful memory for them. Romeo and Juliet. Elizabeth and Nerissa.

With the banquet in mind, Elizabeth realizes she needs fireworks! Nerissa offers her paper and money to buy the gunpowder to make them. Quickly running to the castle store, she buys gunpowder and paper before returning to Nerissa again. Never too far from her side.

When Nerissa gives her the paper, she starts to leave before running back to kiss her on the cheek and swiftly leaving. No words are said or given about the kiss, but it doesn’t seem to bother the knight.

Even still, with the banquet closing in, Elizabeth wishes to stay and not return to the future.

And moments before, Elizabeth asks Nerissa again, [“Are you okay?”](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=aVt1IOPOs86fL63N&t=6456)

To make it in time, Elizabeth uses magic and teleports for her princess to make it in time. And the banquet begins (see: [Princess-Outlander: A Price for Defying Fate](#edge:iphania-outlander)).

Elizabeth is shocked by Nerissa's change. She has sworn herself as a knight to the other. Will she bend the knee and break her word as a knight? Or will she give in once more to what seems to be corruption, as she had done for the king?
