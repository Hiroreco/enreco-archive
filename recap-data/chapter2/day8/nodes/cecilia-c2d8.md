Cecilia begins the day by admiring the [artwork](https://www.youtube.com/live/LyufI3aiCB0?si=D5bnW1Fw0ITvXusf&t=751) of her and her friends in the castle. This is the final day on which she will get to see all her friends before they return to the future.

For most of the day, she spends pleasant moments with her friends, including a [picnic with Shiori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyufI3aiCB0&t=1301s) and learning the truth that the Hot Pink One was [slandering her name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyufI3aiCB0&t=2940s).

Gonathon made good on their promise to buy Cecilia a house from Mordan's house auction. They spent a couple of moments admiring the house and decorating it.

As the time draws near to the banquet, Immerkind takes photos with the suppliers, Princess Bijou, and a curious group comprised of [Lady Bloodflame, Roa, Gonathan, and herself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyufI3aiCB0&t=5945s).

At the banquet, everyone enjoyed the food and pleasantries when suddenly, the unthinkable happened. (See [Princessâ€“Outlander](#edge:iphania-outlander))
