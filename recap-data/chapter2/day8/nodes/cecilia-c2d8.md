Cecilia began the day with a tender moment of reflection, quietly admiring the [artwork](https://www.youtube.com/live/LyufI3aiCB0?si=D5bnW1Fw0ITvXusf&t=751) that adorned the castle walls—portraits of herself and her companions, frozen snapshots of a journey unlike any other. This would be the final day she would spend with them before they all returned to the future. A bittersweet farewell loomed on the horizon.

But the day itself? It was beautiful.

She shared pleasant, heartfelt moments with her friends, including a lighthearted [picnic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyufI3aiCB0&t=1301s) with Shiori. Laughter, warm food, fresh air—it felt like peace. Yet, even in such serenity, Cecilia discovered that the Hot Pink One had been [slandering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyufI3aiCB0&t=2940s) her name behind the scenes. The sting was there, but it couldn’t dim the brightness of the day.

Later, Gonathon fulfilled a promise that had long been in the making. From Mordan’s house auction, they secured Cecilia a home—a gift, a symbol of their bond. Together, they stepped inside its empty halls, letting their imaginations roam as they decorated the space in cheerful daydreams. It wasn’t just a house. It was a future—one Cecilia had never let herself hope for.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Cecilia prepared for the final banquet. She took pictures, capturing moments with Princess Bijou, the ever-curious suppliers, and a delightfully [odd group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyufI3aiCB0&t=5945s) comprised of Lady Bloodflame, Roa, Gonathon, and herself. There was laughter, closeness, a warmth that wrapped around her like a favorite song. It was everything she'd ever wanted—a storybook ending.

Yes, the journey had been long, chaotic, emotional. But she had made friends. She had found meaning. And, for a time, she was happy.

And so, as the final banquet began, Cecilia promised herself one thing: she would enjoy it to the fullest. She would cherish these final moments with her friends, her comrades, and most importantly... her Princess.

But then—the unthinkable happened.
