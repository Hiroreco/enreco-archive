<!-- title: Finding Shelter in the Shadows of Hope-->

**Second chances?**

While Lady Bloodflame seemed blissfully unaware, the turmoil inside Nerissa seemed to only grow, with her own heart's flame waning. The eyes that once sparkled at the sight of the fair knight were dimmer, no longer full of the luster of a maiden freshly in love.

The red knight was not completely clueless to the changes in her demeanor, however. Once again, [she noticed the strange device](https://youtu.be/b-jTHH6GK5w?t=980) in Nerissa's home had been playing all night, so she set out to investigate. Realizing that Nerissa was absent, she immediately called her. In response, Nerissa confirmed she was at the Lucky Lounge and agreed to meet up with her to stop the underground music.

Spending the day together, Lady Bloodflame tried to improve her connection with Nerissa, suggesting they could play the lucky game together first. The Raven agreed, and together the pair bonded once more, though their feelings and fates were now just as intertwined with their gambled fortunes.

Would red persist and rekindle their mutual flame? Or would blue remain colder and distant still?

**DANCE OF SWORDS**

Perhaps not everything was lost?

After their gambling session, Lady Nerissa returned the favor to the knight by offering to [duel](https://youtu.be/b-jTHH6GK5w?t=2110). It was something the Jade Sword warrior was quite fond of, so she agreed in a heartbeat.

_En garde!_

Like lovers dancing, they waltzed with their blades. The sound of the clashing dull swords echoed throughout the court. Their laughter was attuned to each other's heartbeat.

After a few rounds, Lady Bloodflame was finally declared the victor, so Nerissa made haste to buy her a prize— a gorgeous ring with pink stone, similar to what the knight had given her in the previous days.

**WHERE DOES YOUR LOYALTY LIE**

Memories burnt to ash and dust. Embers of ink-stained memories full of lies. Talks of the future, of parties. A Princess, after all, shall always be invited to gatherings.

And what is a princess without her knight to protect her?

["Will you be loyal to me?"](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=FWJgtvNqpWqnfTkF&t=3123)

A promise to be a better knight and to be there through thick and thin. To fight beside one another.

A promise made with unknown repercussions to come.

**LAST MINUTE APOLOGIES**

_Witch_.

How a singular word can hold so much regret. Fifteen days of using one singular word—across past and present—and one moment left to apologize. Every passing minute is a lost opportunity.

It's nothing specific, an overall apology for any sadness.

["I got caught in armor too thick for words."](https://www.youtube.com/live/b-jTHH6GK5w?si=7NiwPGwPqMvY70Gr&t=3472)

When is an apology too late?
When does ink become truth?
When does a flame turn dark?
When does a woman become a witch?
When does a knight bend the knee?
