<!-- title: A Price for Defying Fate -->
<!-- relationship: It's Complicated -->

As the victory banquet approached, the Outlander sought out a private moment with the heroes. He spoke candidly—more openly than ever before.

He revealed his true identity as the Watcher, a member of the Collective, an entity that served under the omnipotent being known as the Origin. According to the Origin, the fate of Libestal had long since been sealed—doomed beyond salvation. The Watcher’s duty was to observe, never to interfere. And for the longest time, he accepted that.

But then, he met Princess Iphania.

Despite the overwhelming despair that surrounded her kingdom, she never gave up. She defied fate, fought to her last breath, and inspired hope in even the most desolate hearts. Her unwavering resolve moved the Outlander, and he began to question everything he believed in. It was that very resolve that led him to cast aside his role, to abandon the will of the Origin, and to take up a sword to fight as a nameless warrior at the Princess’s side.

He thanked the heroes, deeply and sincerely, for shouldering the consequences in his stead, bearing the task of striking down the Curse—defying divine decree to save the world. But a question lingered in his mind: how did they know all this? How did they seem to already understand the truths he had just now revealed?

He never got an answer.

Their conversation was shattered by a sudden, piercing scream.

Rushing to the source, they found Iphania collapsed on the floor—lifeless. And looming above her was the Curse, somehow still alive, having survived what should’ve been its destruction at the hands of the heroes. It had returned.

The shock turned to horror. And then, chaos.

A mysterious figure appeared, speaking cryptically of punishment—for the Outlander, for the heroes, for defying the will of the Origin. The atmosphere turned oppressive, divine, terrifying.

But just as judgment was about to fall, a voice rang out. Familiar. Steady. Comforting.

It was Fia.
