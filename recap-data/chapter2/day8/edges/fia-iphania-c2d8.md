<!-- title: Iphania and Fia -->

Fia turned out to be the Princess all along—and to be fair, the clues were always there. The similarity in their names, Fia and Iphania. Their gentle, soft-spoken nature. The fact that Fia, the doll, was once Iphania’s beloved companion before mysteriously gaining “sentience.” Even Shiori had managed to piece it together long before the truth was revealed.

Still, the revelation came amidst tragedy. Yet even then, the Princess’s resolve never wavered. She was determined—to save the world, the universe, and the ones she held dear.
