<!-- title: ...Princess? -->
<!-- relationship: Protector -->

A scream—piercing, chilling, unmistakably hers.
A girl’s scream.
The Princess’ scream.

Cecilia bolted toward the sound, heart pounding, breath shallow, instincts screaming louder than the cry itself. But what she found at the source brought her world crashing to a halt.

There—right there—lay the Princess.
Still. Lifeless.
Dead.

Time froze. Cecilia’s breath caught. Her voice, her will, everything inside her simply stopped. Disbelief flooded her senses. It wasn’t real. It couldn’t be. The woman she had poured her heart into—gone in an instant.

But before she could even collapse, or cry, or scream, Fia triggered her powers once again. The world twisted, time leapt forward, and everyone was torn from that terrible moment in a desperate escape from whatever force had brought such horror.

Cecilia didn’t want to leave. No—she couldn’t. She wanted to go back. To reach the Princess. To protect her, just one more time. But it was too late.

Or so she thought.

Then came the truth—absurd, miraculous, beautiful: Fia _was_ the [Princess](https://www.youtube.com/live/LyufI3aiCB0?si=H-D5NeI_IUYhZRio&t=6927).
She had survived, reborn—or at least reincarnated—in a small, round, plump cat doll. Ridiculous as it sounded, to Cecilia, it was everything. It didn’t matter what form she took—her conviction to protect the Princess remained as strong as ever.

Her heart knew no bounds. Her love, unshaken. And even if the world twisted, if death loomed, or if everything around them fell apart—Cecilia Immerkind would continue to protect her.

Because this was her love story.
Because kindness was her power.
Because she was Cecilia Immerkind.
