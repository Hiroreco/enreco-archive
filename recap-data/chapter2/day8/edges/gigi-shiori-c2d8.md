<!-- title: Humble Endings, Sinister Beginnings -->

"I will see you tomorrow." These are the words that Shiori of the Nyavellas left Gonathon G with as the two parted the previous day. But what seemed to be a simple promise to meet again before departing the past Libestal together would soon prove to be much more ominous than Gonathon could possibly imagine.

For much of the day, Gonathon and Shiori were perplexingly separate from one another, with Gonathon busying herself with collecting lore and assisting Immerkind with securing a home, and Shiori conversing with others and staying close to her home. It was only as the banquet drew near that Knight and Archiver would reunite, with Gonathon requesting a [picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWNcqsQxuWo&t=6859s) of just the two of them. Departing for the time being, the two agreed to meet up at the victory banquet.

Following the horrific slaying of the Princess Iphania at the banquet, the heroes once again encountered Fia the cat. It was here that a shocking revelation was made: that Fia was in fact the Princess! This in turn raised a foreboding question: were Shiori's comments about the princess and Fia being one the previous day a mere coincidence, or did the archiver know more than she was letting on?

Resolving to do whatever it took to fix the world, Gonathon and her companions seemed set to embark upon a new journey... that was until five sinister figures made their presence known. Now standing in opposition to their former friends, Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, and their leader, Shiori of the Nyavellas, unmasked themselves as malefactors. It was here that Shiori presented the heroes with a question: ["Who's with us?"](https://youtu.be/IWNcqsQxuWo?t=7795)

And with this, the second chapter of Gonathon and Shiori's stories came to a close. With these sudden revelations, several quandaries begin to surface. Did Shiori remove her memories to spare herself the pain of them, or was it to prepare herself for her betrayal of Gonathon? Would Gonathon be able to resist the Archiver's offer, given the oath she swore to her? And who exactly was this "G" that Shiori claimed was another version of Gonathon?
