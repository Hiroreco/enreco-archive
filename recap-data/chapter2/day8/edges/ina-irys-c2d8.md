<!-- title: So Long, Consort -->

The Hot Pink One didn’t know how to react.

After everything—after all the chaos, the love, the heartbreak—she finally received her consort’s response. But it wasn’t what she had hoped for. Ina had made her decision. She wrote that things could not continue as they were, that she needed to leave, to embark on a long journey of self-reflection and repentance. There was no promise of return. No reassurance of love enduring through time and distance. Just... farewell.

The Hot Pink One was stunned, lost for words. She didn’t want to be apart from Ina—not now, not ever. She didn’t just *want* Ina by her side—she *needed* her. Ina was hers, and hers alone. Without her, the world felt cold, empty, and unbearable. She couldn’t even imagine a life without her consort’s presence—her voice, her warmth, her quiet support in even the most turbulent of times. She had to let Ina know. She had to make her [understand](https://www.youtube.com/live/kwmxMSD8tTU?t=3594) how much she meant.

But Ina... Ina had already made up her mind.

And when she heard all the desperate confessions pouring out, she simply... [shrugged them off](https://www.youtube.com/live/PoM6ETBlOVY?t=4319). Her heart had already turned toward her path ahead—one she would walk alone.

Would they meet again? Would their bond endure through the tides of time and change?

Only time would tell.
