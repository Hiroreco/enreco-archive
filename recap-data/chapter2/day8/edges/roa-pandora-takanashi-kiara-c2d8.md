<!-- title: And so, Sesbian Lex. -->

Giddy with ecstasy, Kiara could not wait to spend the night with Roa—or heck, even spend the rest of their lives together. 

The phoenix had a plan for how the day was going to go.  First, she made sure to receive the fanfic commission she had requested from Shiori yesterday. She acquired an available room in Calli's tavern with extra jukebox amenities and a clear window. Kiara bought two invisibility potions as well—this would prove useful later. As if that wasn't enough, she also asked Immerkind for a lesson on how to thrust... if you know what that means.

Kiara and Roa meet at Calli's tavern. 

To set the steamy atmosphere, Kiara read the fanfic, which aroused her wife. Roa and Kiara both then drank the potions and proceeded to *"have fun"* in bed.

After...*that*, Roa suggested buying a house from Calli's auction—even offering her last 4000 coins to help pay for it. [Kiara kept raising her own bid on a large house, which she ended up winning anyway.](https://www.youtube.com/live/8E8Dsgs5e50?si=RxtfN_wMGm29Xkzv&t=3612)

The two moved into their new home fairly quickly, setting up their beds together and putting away their spicy fanfiction.

And so, there was their happy ending... or perhaps a beginning to a new chapter in their marriage.
