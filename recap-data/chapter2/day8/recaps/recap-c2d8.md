## Day 8: The Chains of Fate

The final day, where ends are tied,
Where truths revealed no longer hide.
Our heroes came from far and wide,
Through loops of time they laughed, then cried.

They lost their names, then found them back,
Some found love, then fell off track.
They made new bonds—siblings, friends—
Only to lose them all again.

They wed, divorced, then wed once more,
Formed a pack, then learned the lore—
That fate had played its twisted thread,
Their lineage woven... slightly inbread.

A journey wild, chaotic, strange,
Yet strangely warm within its range.
No gloomy skies or final fights,
Just laughter, auctions, sweet delights.

Letters penned with heartfelt tone,
Meals and photos, joy well-sown.
The kingdom basked in peace so bright—
A calm before the fall of night.

If only joy could stay for long.
If only fate would prove us wrong.
But in the cheer, an echo cried,
A shatter through the veil of time.

What they had done, defied the thread—
The law of gods, the voice of dread.
Divine retribution soon would fall,
For breaking fate’s ordained call.

A voice familiar cried, “Not yet!”
One last wish, one last regret.
To change the future, just a spark—
Enough to light the cold and dark.

Some hearts aligned, no terms, no test,
They took her hand and gave their yes.
But five stood firm, turned from the light,
Their hearts now shrouded in the night.

Once they laughed and fought as peers,
Now turned by pain, distrust, and fears.
Fuwawa, Mococo, Bijou, Nerissa, Shiori’s flame
Once heroes proud, now none the same.

No gods, no stars, no oaths to bind—
They sought their truth, their own design.
And thus began with hearts unshaken—
The quiet rise of rebellion awakened.
