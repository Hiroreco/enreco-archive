## Chapter 3, Day 1 (EXAMPLE)

**Before submitting your work:**

- Is your recap under 900 words? If it's too long, trim it down.
- Does your recap tell a cohesive story, rather than just listing events?
- Does it continue the ongoing narrative arc of the character(s)?
- Have you moved all relationship developments into separate relationship cards?
- Have you included timestamps where appropriate?
- Were there any special texts (e.g., _A Knight’s Tale_, letters, poems)? If so, have you added them using the correct format from the guide?
- For major relationship cards, did you check the context from the other character’s POV?
